The instant I saw the all together too average man, I could feel my heartbeat speeding up and mouth mouth drying out. My body was preparing to fight, remembering all to well the last time I&rsquo;d been in his pretense.</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t see anything else other than the inside of whatever mammoth cargo plane had brought us here&ndash;wherever here was. The average man had called this home and the only place I had ever seen him was in Baghdad, were we back in Iraq?</p><p>He seemed to be waiting for something, looking at me, perhaps trying to determine if I had recognized him. Of course I had&ndash;how could I not&ndash;but for the moment, perhaps playing dumb was the best option.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I asked. It sounded like just the right amount of incredulity, but it wasn&rsquo;t the sort that one could really judge of themselves. &ldquo;Why have you brought us here.&rdquo;</p><p>He waited a second more as if expecting me to continue, but when I didn&rsquo;t he said, &ldquo;You know exactly who I am, Thomas Whitlock&ndash;&rdquo; I felt Father Antonio&rsquo;s gaze intensify at that and knew exactly what he was thinking. <em>I knew this man?</em> &ldquo;&ndash;and like I said. We are home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which doesn&rsquo;t really answer either question,&rdquo; I replied. Forget pretending. &ldquo;You never did tell me your name. And how could I know were your home is? It certainly isn&rsquo;t mine.&rdquo;</p><p>His answer was slow and measured. &ldquo;But in a way, it is. It may not be the home of your physical self, but your spiritual self&ndash;&rdquo; He gestured around, seeming to ignore the fact that all I could see was the belly of the cargo plane. &ldquo;&ndash;this is where it all began.&rdquo;</p><p>I just blinked at him. If I was following what he meant, he meant the home of the Church. But that was in Vatican City, wasn&rsquo;t it? With the Pope? But that was the one place on Earth I was most sure we <em>weren&rsquo;t</em> at anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;I see you are confused,&rdquo; he said, a faint smile on his face. For some reason, that creeped me out more than anything else. &ldquo;Here, let me show you.&rdquo; He moved to one side of the doorway, clearly expecting me to follow him.</p><p>Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t know what other choice I had.</p><p>I stepped to the back of the truck, hoping down onto a sort of rubbery mesh on the floor. A few seconds later, I felt as much as heard Father Antonio jumping down behind me.</p><p>Once we were both on the ground, Mr. Average raised his voice to the others back in the truck. &ldquo;I truly am sorry that you were caught up in all of this. Hazards of the trade and all that. I&rsquo;m sure that my men will be more than capable of&mldr; taking care of you.&rdquo; Something in the way he said it sent the hairs on the back of my neck standing straight on end. I didn&rsquo;t want to think of what layers of meaning such a statement could possibly hold. At the moment, I didn&rsquo;t even know how <em>I</em> was going to get out of the situation, let alone help anyone else.</p><p>And for all I knew, <em>we</em> were the ones in the more dangerous position.</p><p>But like I&rsquo;d said, we really didn&rsquo;t have much choice in the matter.</p><p>Without another word, Mr. Average turned and started heading towards what I assumed was the read of the plane. He seemed just to assume that we would follow him.</p><p>Of course, he was right. But that didn&rsquo;t mean that he couldn&rsquo;t have at least asked&ndash;or even ordered&ndash;us to follow.</p><h1 id=150---not-rome>150 - Not Rome</h1><p><strong>PRESENT DAY</strong>
Shortly thereafter, we were joined once again by Amira. I was a little surprised to see this&ndash;just how much did this guy know to separate the three of us out of the entire group that he had kidnapped? Then again, who <em>was</em> he to be able to send in an armed and armored task force into the heart of the Vatican to kidnap such a relatively large group seemingly without fear of retribution.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t providing much in the way of answers though, just walking towards the back of the plane. I could see now that there was a large ramp there, currently pointing upwards. It was more than large enough for any one of the trucks to depart had it been deployed. That must have been how they&rsquo;d gotten them in here in the first place; although it seemed overkill for a few people to walk down.</p><p>Apparently Mr. Average had no such concerns though, as when he reached the door, he fiddled with a hanging control panel for a few moments. As he did, the entire back section of the plane started to descend.</p><p>I was immediately hit with a blast of dry air, just a touch on the warmer side. It was bright outside, bright enough to be midday easily. I knew it had been well past midnight when we&rsquo;d been taken but now&ndash;I suddenly realized that my cell phone had been taken from me, probably while I&rsquo;d been asleep. It made sense, really, but it was disorienting to say the least.</p><p>Still, if it was around noon local time and we had just landed that narrowed down were we were to&mldr; well, to most of Europe honestly. Perhaps even the northern part of Africa or the Middle East.</p><p>Looking out into the glare, it seemed very much like a stereotypical airport. We were on a large paved area&ndash;either a runway or something like it&ndash;and in the distance I could see a section of what looked like scrub land before a tall fence. The landscape reminded me of the road trip I&rsquo;d taken out west some years back, the same sort of rough, dry landscape you saw in Montana or the Dakotas.</p><p>But I doubted we&rsquo;d flown all of the way back to the United States. It had taken the better part of a day to get to Rome in the first place&ndash;I doubted that such a large cargo plane could have made the trip any more quickly.</p><p>While I was studying the view, I became aware of the sensation of a warm hand on my arm. I turned to see Amira standing right beside me, her dark eyes wide. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; she said quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest,&rdquo; I said, and it was the honest-to-God truth. Even after how much ever sleep I&rsquo;d gotten, my brain still felt fuzzy.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hear because you have something of mine,&rdquo; Mr. Average&rsquo;s voice came from entirely too close. I looked up to see him standing no more than arm&rsquo;s length away. I hadn&rsquo;t even heard him move.</p><p>I&rsquo;d heard this story before. &ldquo;And what might that be?&rdquo;</p><p>I knew his answer even before he said it. &ldquo;An artifact I have every reason to believe is currently in your possession.&rdquo; That was a nice blast of deja vu. &ldquo;The Cup of Lazarus.&rdquo;</p><p>At least he&rsquo;d put a name to it this time. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have the Cup,&rdquo; I said. No point in lying any more. And so far as I knew, it was true. I&rsquo;d never asked which of Amira and Father Antonio had had the shard when we&rsquo;d left Amira&rsquo;s flat and at the moment, it didn&rsquo;t really matter. Lazarus himself had most of the cup and if Mr. Average really wanted the piece we had, then he would have taken it when he&rsquo;d taken my cell phone.</p><p>So what did he need us for? The cup was with Lazarus after all.</p><p>Maybe that was the way out of this whole mess. &ldquo;If you want it, you&rsquo;ll have to ask Lazarus for it. It&rsquo;s his, after all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That old fool?&rdquo; Mr. Average said. His tone made it perfectly clear what he thought of that. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t any more claim to the Cup than you do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> named after him,&rdquo; I said.</p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; His voice had a definite edge now. &ldquo;If that were the case, your country would belong to Vespucci.&rdquo; I decided that I preferred the less emotional Mr. Average. He was creepier then, but creepy was preferable to outright scary. &ldquo;The Cup is mine.&rdquo;</p><p>Amira cut in then, asking the question that had been running through my mind for years. &ldquo;So just who <em>are</em> you then?&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Average was silent and still for so long I thought for just a moment that he&rsquo;d actually turned to stone. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been the strangest thing I&rsquo;d seen&ndash;not even the strangest this week.</p><p>Finally though, he shook his head. The edge was gone with his voice, but the soft tone that replaced it sent shivers down my spine even worse.</p><p>&ldquo;Once upon a time, I was a simple potter.&rdquo;</p></div></article></div></div><footer id=page-footer role=contentinfo><nav id=footer-navigation role=navigation class=ribbon><ul class=main-navigation><li><a href=/archive-by-date/>All posts: By Date</a></li><li><a href=/archive-by-tag/>All posts: By Tag</a></li><li><a href=/atom.xml>RSS: All <sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li><li><a href=/writing/atom.xml>RSS: writing<sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li></ul></nav><div id=page-footer-content data-pagefind-ignore=all><div class=legal><p>All posts unless otherwise mentioned are licensed under
