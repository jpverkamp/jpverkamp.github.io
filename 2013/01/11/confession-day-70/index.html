<p><strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO</strong>
Running into a thick white fog to help a self-proclaimed dead man fight off his once brother turned demon wasn&rsquo;t exactly the most intelligent thing that I&rsquo;d ever done. Truth be told, I had no idea what I was even going to do once I got in there, but I knew that I had to try something.</p>

<p>For Amanda, if nothing else.</p>

<p>As I ran, I felt time stretching out. I thought back on the past few days, trying to find that one moment where I could have made a different decision and avoided the entire situation.</p>

<p>Nothing came to mind.</p>

<p>Not a single thing. Each decision had seemed minor at the time, a single step on the road. Yet as they say, the path to Hell is paved with good intentions. I didn&rsquo;t believe that I was bound for Hell, but it seemed like just a bit of it had found its way to me.</p>

<p>I emerged into a hole in the fog in the middle of the room, the temperature jumping up perhaps ten degrees as I did. I immediately felt sweat beading on my skin.</p>

<p>Not-Alex and John were standing there, face to face. John still had the fire extinguisher that he&rsquo;d been holding earlier, although the metal of the cylinder had been crushed in the center, bent inwards like a discarded pop can. There was a gash on one side with some sort of white liquid leaking out.</p>

<p>At least now I knew where the fog had come from.</p>

<p>John looked tired. Dead tired. He was barely holding onto the hunk of metal. I would have been willing to bet that was the only reason that he was still alive. I noted to my surprise that he still had his gun; I could see it tucked into the waistband of his pants. Why wasn&rsquo;t he using it?</p>

<p>Not-Alex didn&rsquo;t even look winded. Granted, it was hard to tell exactly how a ghost-turned-demon was feeling, but he just stood there looking as solid as a rock wall. His fists were clenched tightly, that faint reddish glow still leaking out from between his fingers.</p>

<p>When I slowed to a stop just inside the clear area in the cloud, both of them turned to look at me.</p>

<p>John looked beaten. It was clear in his eyes. There was no other way to put it.</p>

<p>Not-Alex sneered. &ldquo;Looks like the calvary has finally arrived, eh brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice was wrong. So wrong. The rumbling of stones in a metal drum. It grated on my ears to hear it, only made worse knowing that it wasn&rsquo;t Alex anymore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not my brother,&rdquo; John replied. His heart wasn&rsquo;t in it anymore though. He half-heartedly raised the remains of the fire extinguisher and took a step forward.</p>

<p>Not-Alex sneered. &ldquo;A moment, if you please father.&rdquo; He turned almost lazily back to John and stepped forward to meet him.</p>

<p>With surprising deftness, John suddenly spun, whipping the extinguisher around in a full circle.</p>

<p><em>Had he just been biding his time?</em></p>

<p>But it didn&rsquo;t matter. Not-Alex had plenty of time to leisurely raise one hand, almost as if he were hailing a cab.</p>

<p>If he&rsquo;d been human, John&rsquo;s blow would have broken his hand at the very least.</p>

<p>But he wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The bent cylinder smashed into his hand and just stopped dead. He might as well have swung it against a wall&ndash;although that likely would have had more effect.</p>

<p>Another sneer from not-Alex. Then he closed his fist, taking hold of the fire extinguisher from the inside, pulling it towards himself.</p>

<p>John held on for a moment, trying to rip it from not-Alex&rsquo;s hands. Instead, he was pulled forward, right towards not-Alex. One stumbling step. Two.</p>

<p>And then not-Alex jerked. Hark. The metal was pulled from John&rsquo;s hands, sending him sprawling forward onto the floor.</p>

<p>I had a moment then, a moment to react.</p>

<p>But nothing. I found myself frozen in place. John was bigger than me, stronger physically. If he couldn&rsquo;t best whatever it was his brother had become, what hope did I have?</p>

<p>Then the moment was over. Not-Alex swung the fire extinguisher&ndash;still wrapped around his smoldering fist&ndash;in a swift downward struck.</p>

<p>Right into the back of John&rsquo;s skull.</p>

<h1 id="152-baghdad">152 - Baghdad</h1>

<p><strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO</strong>
&ldquo;Good morning, sleepyhead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I awoke slowly, blinking the sleep out of eyes that felt glued shut.</p>

<p><em>Where am I?</em></p>

<p>It all came back slowly, like a half remembered dream.</p>

<p>Waking up under the museum.</p>

<p>Being questioned by the Sergeant.</p>

<p>Amira&rsquo;s kidnapping.</p>

<p>The mysterious orders to rescue her.</p>

<p>Finding here in the same room I&rsquo;d been held in, hooked to an IV drip of some strange fluids.</p>

<p>Mr. Average.</p>

<p>Shielding her from the shrapnel.</p>

<p>My apparent descent into madness.</p>

<p>Being taken to the hospital.</p>

<p>It all came back to me then, and I opened my eyes wide.</p>

<p>There was light streaming in from the window, sheer white curtains blowing faintly in the wind. I was in a bed of some sort, the sheets matching the walls in a faint pastel blue.</p>

<p>And Amira was sitting in a wheelchair right beside my bed, a blanked across her lap and a smile on her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was beginning to worry if you would ever wake up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had to smile at that. I wondered how long I&rsquo;d been out. &ldquo;Been a long day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No kidding.&rdquo; Her hands were folded in her lap.</p>

<p>Again, I noticed the wheelchair. &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She followed my gaze and to my surprise broke into an even wider smile. &ldquo;Oh this? Silly thing. But the doctors insist. They say it&rsquo;s hospital policy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I let out a breath I hadn&rsquo;t even known I&rsquo;d been holding. I&rsquo;d been worried that Mr. Average had done something&hellip; more to her.</p>

<p>For several long moments, we were both silent. But it wasn&rsquo;t an uncomfortable silence, but rather the familiar sort of silence that develops between old friends. I&rsquo;d only known Amira for a few weeks, but already it felt like a lifetime.</p>

<p><em>I suppose nearly being killed&ndash;several times&ndash;will do that to someone.</em></p>

<p>Finally, it was Amira that broke the silence. Hesitating, she asked, &ldquo;so what happened after I was&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kidnapped?&rdquo; I supplied.</p>

<p>She nodded. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get anyone to give me a straight answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I doubted many of them knew themselves. Heck, as clearly as I could remember, <em>I</em> didn&rsquo;t even know what had been going on.</p>

<p>But I told her everything that I knew. I started further back, from when I&rsquo;d been taken myself, coming right up to essentially losing my mind. She smiled slightly at that. I wondered if perhaps people <em>had</em> told her at least about that part.</p>

<p>To her credit, she didn&rsquo;t interrupt once. Even during the more&hellip; fantastic elements of the story.</p>

<p>When I was done, she was silent for a moment. Then she simply said, &ldquo;well, I&rsquo;m glad that it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shook my head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure it is. Surely, he&rsquo;s not going to stop until he gets what he&rsquo;s looking for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face fell slightly. I knew what her next words were going to be before she even spoke them. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not going to be a problem any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He took the pottery?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He took the pottery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shook my head. I could have felt angry. Frustrated. Enraged. But mostly I just felt tired. No matter how long I&rsquo;d been asleep, that had been something to recover from.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder who he was?&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>But at the same time, a part of me hoped I would never know.</p>

<h1 id="153-not-rome">153 - Not Rome</h1>

<p><strong>PRESENT DAY</strong>
&ldquo;<em>You&rsquo;re</em> the one that created the Cup of Lazarus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Average nodded. &ldquo;Stupid name though. Lazarus didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the cup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shook my head. Another impossible thing. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s just another mistake that you&rsquo;re still alive too then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smirked. &ldquo;No, not at all. My resurrection was entirely intentional.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I heard Father Antonio snort. *Was</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have something to say?&rdquo; Mr. Average turned towards him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one man had the right to come back from the dead.&rdquo; There was a solid quality to his voice that I had to admire, particularly given the situation. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other man smiled that strangely serpentine smile. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m not. But he&rsquo;s not here right now. I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s will is present in each of us.&rdquo; Perfectly confident. I had to give that to him, Father Antonio had confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well aren&rsquo;t you the good little alter boy,&rdquo; Mr. Average growled.</p>

<p>Amira&rsquo;s voice cut in, thankfully forestalling any more of that particular argument. &ldquo;So how did you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Average&rsquo;s gaze snapped to her and for a moment, I was afraid for her. There were three of us and only one of him, granted, but that didn&rsquo;t take into account the dozens of armed men back on the plane that he surely could call on. And I was sure that after 2000 years&ndash;if he was to be believed&ndash;he&rsquo;d surely picked up a trick or two.</p>

<p>But then some of the tension went out of him&ndash;at least a bit. &ldquo;The Cup. I used the Cup of&hellip;&rdquo; He sounded like he had to force the last word out. &ldquo;Lazarus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something that had been tickling at the back of my mind for a while suddenly leaped to the forefront. &ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t work, did it? You came back wrong?&rdquo; I remembered Alex. Not-Alex. The fight at Mrs. Claire&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>His glare came back to me, hard once again. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve used it yourself, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t answer. But I didn&rsquo;t have to; he knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter.&rdquo; He paused for a moment, measuring me. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually not far off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Cup of Lazarus was never intended to do what it does. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve figured that much out. It recorded God&rsquo;s words, that much is true, but it could never capture the really important part. It could never capture the Spirit of the Word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you need something else.&rdquo; It was finally starting to come together in my mind. &ldquo;A demon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smirked again&ndash;and just for an instant, the mask fell. There was a man there, or what had once been a man, but there was was something else. Something serpentine, something wrong.</p>

<p>Then he was back. That unsettling overly average man, yet still just a man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>I shook my head. I was starting to really agree with Lazarus. The Cup needed to be destroyed.</p>

<p>Of course it would help if I knew where it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So why are we here?&rdquo; I asked. That was the one thing that I really couldn&rsquo;t figure out. He had our piece of the Cup back now, so what more could he possibly want from us?</p>

<p>His answer sent chills up my spine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bait.&rdquo;</p></div>
