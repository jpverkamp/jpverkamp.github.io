&lt;p>On a brighter note, Prof. Wollowski and I have written a paper based on the AIGS project and have submitted it to FLAIRS 2010 (an AI conference in Florida).  This will potentially be my third published work in CS.  Hope it gets accepted!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AIGS 2009 Update</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2009/11/12/aigs-2009-update/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2009 08:05:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2009/11/12/aigs-2009-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Bug fixes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Flag respawning is more solid (not completely guaranteed though, because I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually been able to duplicate the issue).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should cause an error if you try to capture your own player.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Thanks to Chris Covert for testing the problems that I was having.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AIGS 2009 Update</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2009/11/07/aigs-2009-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2009 08:05:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2009/11/07/aigs-2009-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>New version uploaded.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bug fixes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fixed swapping players bug.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Potential fix for not your turn bug (not sure if this one will work).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sending &amp;lsquo;Unsolvable&amp;rsquo; as a move can be used to prematurely end a game (and will output the game log).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed/removed extra YourTurn packets sent on failed move.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed capturing, players can now capture correctly and wil respawn at their bases.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed returning flags. Flags were returning at (0, 0), now the return to their spawn points.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>End of game now actually ends instead of looping with a winner (or Tie Game) returned.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Removed extra print statements from server code (that were printing multiple slightly different states).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Added logic to allow the second player to continue after the first player is done (thanks Eric Reed).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The flag spawn logic was preventing you from moving off of spawn points, not onto them (oops).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>All of the changes that are mentioned in the Tournament Rules document have been completed with the following notes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Always 3 players per team&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not guaranteed to be solvable (though I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen an unsolvable one yet).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can only capture flags on the other side of the board&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Flags respawn at random locations on your side of the map&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can only see your flags when they have not been captured&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Non-wall squares you cannot see will be sent as a &amp;lsquo;*&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Captured players will spawn adjacent to their home base&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If no location is available, they will try further out in concentric circles&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>AIGS 2009 Update</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2009/09/30/aigs-2009-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2009 09:05:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2009/09/30/aigs-2009-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>New version of the server is available:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Changes&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Added RemainingFlags message.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MoveMade packets will be sent for each move. Periodically checking for the server for sync is suggested.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It should now be possible for players to move past each other (swap places, etc).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>AIGS 2009 Update</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2009/09/22/aigs-2009-update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2009 09:05:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2009/09/22/aigs-2009-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>The new version of the server has been updated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Changes:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Added a rudimentary AI player to play against for the next assignment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added scenarios for assignment 3.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed typos in previous assignments.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added an argument to the protocol for YourTurn messages to tell you who you are (update your CTFProtocol file).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>AIGS 2009 Update</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2009/09/17/aigs-2009-update/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2009 09:05:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2009/09/17/aigs-2009-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ok, so the new server is up.  I can almost guarantee that there are some problems (so goes the life of a CS), so go ahead and hammer away at it and see what you can do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One major thing, the game string format has changed:**
**&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Players are represented by lower case letters from &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;j&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Players carrying flags are represented by upper case letters from &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;J&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bases are represented by numbers &amp;lsquo;0&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;9&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Players will immediately score if no bases are present but must return a flag to a base if one is present&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Players must step on flags to pick them up, but only must be adjacent to a base to drop it off&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Players can only carry one flag&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>AIGS 2009 Update</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2009/09/09/aigs-2009-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2009 09:05:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2009/09/09/aigs-2009-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Initial upload of the server.  There was a pre-release version emailed to the class (that I no longer have), thus the &amp;lsquo;updates.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All versions of the server should run correctly with .NET installed in Windows or with Mono on Linux or OSX.  I&amp;rsquo;ve tested the Windows and Linux versions and both seem to work perfectly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Updates&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sequential games are possible. You can not join two games at the same time, but once one game is complete you can join another.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can send &amp;ldquo;Unsolvable&amp;rdquo; as a move string (see CTFProtocol). If you are correct, you win. If you are incorrect, you lose. I suggest that you are completely sure before you send this message. ;D&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>AIGS 2009 Overview</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2009/09/01/aigs-2009-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 09:05:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2009/09/01/aigs-2009-overview/</guid><description>&lt;p>Despite what I said last year, I started the AIGS over this year.  To shake things up a bit, I&amp;rsquo;m implementing this year&amp;rsquo;s version with .NET in C# (the previous two years used Python and Java respectively).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year, the game will be Capture the Flag.  Hopefully, we can have a more complex game without overdoing it and avoid the problems with low branching factor that we had last year with Hex.  Keep an eye on this spot for more updates.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AIGS 2008 Update</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2008/10/31/aigs-2008-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2008 09:05:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2008/10/31/aigs-2008-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>This version of the AI Game Server includes several minor updates to documentation (mostly to reflect the changes outlined below in the server) and a few changes (including one major change) to the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the server has been changed to send the final move along with GameOver moves, primarily for bookkeeping on the part of the clients.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AIGS 2008 Update</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2008/10/15/aigs-2008-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2008 09:05:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2008/10/15/aigs-2008-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>The documentation has not changed for this version; however, a few relatively major updates have been made to the server code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the second player swap rule has been implemented to prevent either player from having an easily implemented perfect strategy. Now, after the first player has played, the second player can choose to either continue the game as normal or to switch places with the first player.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, a 4th argument has been added to the JoinSuccess and GameState messages to tell the client if they are player 1 or player 2.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AIGS 2008 Update</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2008/10/10/aigs-2008-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2008 09:05:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2008/10/10/aigs-2008-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the first version of both the AI Game Server documentation and code. To write a client for the AIGS, I would suggest reading the documentation, it should contain all you need to connect to and interact with the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you run the included jar file, it will run a working copy of the server. This version of the server does not contain a complete GUI, I hope to have that in a few days; however, a working version of Hex is included. If you would like to see the source cope, just open the jar file, all of the source code is included.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AIGS 2008 Overview</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2008/10/01/aigs-2008-overview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2008 09:05:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2008/10/01/aigs-2008-overview/</guid><description>&lt;p>The AI Game Server started last winter when I was taking CSSE 413 (Artificial Intelligence). As part of the class, we were told to design an AI program capable of playing checkers. Rather than the entire class having to decide on and build in network communication routines, I decided to volunteer to build a server for the class. The first version of this server (which eventually became AIGS) was called PyCheck. It was written purely in Python, using the Twisted framework for networking and wxPython for the GUI. If I can find that original code, I&amp;rsquo;ll post it here as well.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
