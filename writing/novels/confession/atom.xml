&lt;p>&lt;em>PRESENT DAY&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;and licked my face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was such a surprising yet so absolutely doggy thing to do that I barked out a laugh; I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t help it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 73</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/14/confession-day-73/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2013 03:00:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/14/confession-day-73/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="159---al-eizariya">159 - al-Eizariya&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PRESENT DAY&lt;/strong>
I could see the two of them struggling for control, each trying to force the Cup from the other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far as I knew, Lazarus was still mostly human&amp;ndash;albeit able to appear and disappear in a most unsettling manner. Mr. Average on the other hand&amp;hellip; not so much. He definitely had something going on in the supernatural department.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 72</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/13/confession-day-72/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2013 04:30:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/13/confession-day-72/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="156---al-eizariya">156 - al-Eizariya&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PRESENT DAY&lt;/strong>
Why did he want the three of us?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For some reason he had gotten it in his head that we would be the perfect bait to lure Lazarus to him.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 71</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/12/confession-day-71/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2013 06:00:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/12/confession-day-71/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="154---chicago">154 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
I threw myself at not-Alex&amp;rsquo;s side. I doubted that it would do any good, but there had to be some hope&amp;ndash;although I knew in my heart of hearts that there was none for John. I could see the blood. I could see how still he was. I knew that he was dead. Again, if he had been telling the truth. Not that that mattered any more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 70</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/11/confession-day-70/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jan 2013 09:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/11/confession-day-70/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="151---chicago">151 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
Running into a thick white fog to help a self-proclaimed dead man fight off his once brother turned demon wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly the most intelligent thing that I&amp;rsquo;d ever done. Truth be told, I had no idea what I was even going to do once I got in there, but I knew that I had to try something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Amanda, if nothing else.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 69</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/10/confession-day-69/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jan 2013 09:20:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/10/confession-day-69/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="149---not-rome">149 - Not Rome&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PRESENT DAY&lt;/strong>
The instant I saw the all together too average man, I could feel my heartbeat speeding up and mouth mouth drying out. My body was preparing to fight, remembering all to well the last time I&amp;rsquo;d been in his pretense.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 68</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/09/confession-day-68/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2013 06:30:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/09/confession-day-68/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="146---chicago">146 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
My cry was in vain. The fire extinguished passed through the air as if it were just that&amp;ndash;air. There was a muted flash of light from right in front of me and a sound like popcorn popping. A heartbeat later and both were gone. The flash hadn&amp;rsquo;t been bright but nevertheless it was more than enough to bring my hands instinctively to my face. When my vision cleared, I saw that the carefully placed gemstones had moved. Several had jumped, leaving tiny black smudges, almost like burn marks. At least three of them appeared to have cracked into several smaller pieces while one of the quartz crystals&amp;ndash;the one closest to me&amp;ndash;had been reduced to little more than a pile of dust.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 67</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/08/confession-day-67/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2013 08:15:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/08/confession-day-67/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="144---baghdad">144 - Baghdad&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO&lt;/strong>
The sound in such an enclose space was deafening. I&amp;rsquo;d thought that I knew what to expect, but there&amp;rsquo;s really nothing that can prepare you for something like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within moments, my ears were ringing, seconds after that, the world took on a muted quality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 66</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/07/confession-day-66/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2013 04:30:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/07/confession-day-66/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="142---romepresent-daya-knock-down-drag-out-preacher-fight-was-coming-between-father-antonio-and-myself-that-much-was-sure-but-whenever-that-might-be-it-most-certainly-wasnt-now">142 - Rome&lt;strong>PRESENT DAY&lt;/strong>A knock down, drag out preacher fight was coming between Father Antonio and myself, that much was sure. But whenever that might be, it most certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t now.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Just as I&amp;rsquo;d managed to threaten my fellow priest, there was a sudden grinding sound all around, so loud that for just a moment nothing else seemed to exist. Nothing but that terrible sound.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 65</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/06/confession-day-65/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jan 2013 03:00:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/06/confession-day-65/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="139---rome">139 - Rome&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PRESENT DAY&lt;/strong>
I turned back into the truck. One of the guards&amp;ndash;the one in the ordinary uniform&amp;ndash;was still unconscious, the other in his black armor was sitting there as if he hadn&amp;rsquo;t a care in the world, despite the gun held on him by Father Antonio.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 64</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/05/confession-day-64/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jan 2013 03:00:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/05/confession-day-64/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="135---chicago">135 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
As Alex appeared I heard several gasps from around the room. For all I knew, one of them could have been mine. It was one thing to know that Alex was a ghost and to know that what we were doing was supposed to call him hear to us. It was quite another for him to just appear there like that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 63</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/04/confession-day-63/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2013 09:02:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/04/confession-day-63/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="134---baghdad">134 - Baghdad&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO&lt;/strong>
It was quick and it was brutal. And then it was over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just like that, a dozen or more men were dead or dying right in front of me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 62</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/03/confession-day-62/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jan 2013 08:30:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/03/confession-day-62/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="131---chicago">131 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
Chanting in what felt like Latin&amp;ndash;although a good portion of the words I&amp;rsquo;d never heard before&amp;ndash;brought me back to the days when I&amp;rsquo;d been studying at the seminary. There had been many a class where we&amp;rsquo;d been expected to know the exact text of manuscripts that predated the English language itself by hundreds of years&amp;ndash;translations not allowed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 61</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/02/confession-day-61/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2013 08:48:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/02/confession-day-61/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="130---chicago">130 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
I arrived back at Mrs. Claire&amp;rsquo;s before John Smith. I debated if I were actually going to tell the women there about the details of our arrangement&amp;ndash;that he&amp;rsquo;d be arriving shortly himself&amp;ndash;but eventually I settled on not. They would find out soon enough; otherwise, it would only serve to complicate things further.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 60</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/31/confession-day-60/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2012 06:30:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/31/confession-day-60/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="129---rome">129 - Rome&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO&lt;/strong>
&amp;ldquo;What in the world is going on?&amp;rdquo; I heard one of the people I hadn&amp;rsquo;t known that had been abducted with us whisper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an answer for him, but at the moment, it was just as well. For just when he spoke, the cop in the dark armor&amp;ndash;it was slightly shiny, which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed until we were in the light of the back of the truck&amp;ndash;glared at him and shifted his gun in a way we were all sure to notice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 59</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/30/confession-day-59/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Dec 2012 09:30:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/30/confession-day-59/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="126---chicago">126 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
&amp;ldquo;So let me get this straight,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re dead. Your brother is dead. Everyone is dead.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure. Perhaps it was a bit of an overreaction. But my head was still spinning from that particular revelation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 58</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/29/confession-day-58/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2012 09:04:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/29/confession-day-58/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="125---baghdad">125 - Baghdad&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO&lt;/strong>
We ran. We ran like the very hounds of hell were after us, across that courtyard, right up to the very front doors of the museum. I kept expecting shots to ring out. To once again be shot, this time in my chest rather than in the back. And this time, I was sure, that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so lucky.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 57</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/28/confession-day-57/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2012 08:00:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/28/confession-day-57/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="123---rome">123 - Rome&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PRESENT DAY&lt;/strong>
When I saw that angels are fast, that really doesn&amp;rsquo;t help to describe how terrifying it is to be directly in front of not one, but two angels running directly at you&amp;ndash;one with sword raised over his head and the other with a smaller, curved blade to her side.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 56</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/27/confession-day-56/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2012 09:00:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/27/confession-day-56/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="122---chicago">122 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
Time seemed not so much to slow as to go sideways for a moment, a whole series of things not happening so much as at once but rather in a timeless sort of mishmash.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 55</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/26/confession-day-55/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2012 10:55:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/26/confession-day-55/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="121---chicago">121 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
In the end, we decided on a combination of the first two options, with the third acting as a sort of failsafe. Just in case.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 54</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/25/confession-day-54/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Dec 2012 03:15:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/25/confession-day-54/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="118---baghdad">118 - Baghdad&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO&lt;/strong>
The sounds of gunfire started just as we were getting into position. that wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to happen&amp;ndash;we were supposed to be among the first in. Had we already lost the element of surprise? That didn&amp;rsquo;t bode well. Not at all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 53</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/24/confession-day-53/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2012 09:00:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/24/confession-day-53/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="116---rome">116 - Rome&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PRESENT DAY&lt;/strong>
Between Michael, Father Antonio, and Amira, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have the slightest problem getting into Vatican City, despite the late hour. No one even seemed to notice us, although if that was the norm or some sort of supernatural intervention on Michael&amp;rsquo;s part I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have said.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 52</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/23/confession-day-52/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Dec 2012 02:45:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/23/confession-day-52/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="113---rome">113 - Rome&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PRESENT DAY&lt;/strong>
&amp;ldquo;What happened to you?&amp;rdquo; Direct seemed the way to go&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He seemed to be having trouble catching his breath. &amp;ldquo;Big dog.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 51</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/22/confession-day-51/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2012 04:55:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/22/confession-day-51/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="112---chicago">112 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
I never would have expected to be going back to Mrs. Claire&amp;rsquo;s so soon. But I needed supplies. If I could believe what Sister Kat had said&amp;ndash;and I had no particular reason to doubt her&amp;ndash;then there were things that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have the first idea how to find.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I knew someone who did.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 50</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/21/confession-day-50/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Dec 2012 07:25:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/21/confession-day-50/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="110---chicago">110 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
I made call after call to my fellow priests around the diocese, yet I wasn&amp;rsquo;t having any luck narrowing down exactly what I was supposed to do about the situation. Really, there were two problems that were getting in my way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 49</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/20/confession-day-49/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2012 07:30:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/20/confession-day-49/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="108---baghdad">108 - Baghdad&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO&lt;/strong>
I took a gun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In hindsight&amp;ndash;which is of course 20/20&amp;ndash;that may not have been the best idea I&amp;rsquo;d ever had.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 48</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/19/confession-day-48/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2012 09:30:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/19/confession-day-48/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="105---chicago">105 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
After that all together too depressing exit, I was more than ready to leave Mrs. Claire&amp;rsquo;s. Now I knew that she had been telling the truth&amp;ndash;she was being haunted. So far as if Alex was actually having any effect on her business, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say for sure, but that was a completely secondary motivation. And then there was Alex&amp;rsquo;s request. That was something to think about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 47</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/18/confession-day-47/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Dec 2012 09:30:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/18/confession-day-47/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="104---baghdad">104 - Baghdad&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO&lt;/strong>
&amp;ldquo;There has to be more to it then that.&amp;rdquo; I could feel the pitch of my voice rising, but there was little I could do to control it. He just wasn&amp;rsquo;t willing to listen to reason and it was extremely frustrating.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 46</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/17/confession-day-46/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2012 09:55:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/17/confession-day-46/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="103---chicago">103 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;em>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently Alex and Amanda had dated, back before he&amp;rsquo;d died. Mrs. Claire didn&amp;rsquo;t know how long before, if they&amp;rsquo;d broken up or not, and the way the two of them were glaring at each other and circling, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly keen on breaking in to ask.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 45</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/16/confession-day-45/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2012 08:00:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/16/confession-day-45/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="102---rome">102 - Rome&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PRESENT DAY&lt;/strong>
I drove. And while I drove, I filled Father Antonio and Amira in on at least so much as I knew about the entire situation. They were adequately surprised and disbelieving&amp;ndash;at first&amp;ndash;when I told them that the lady who had threatened us was actually a giant dog; neither had actually heard of any such thing before.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 44</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/15/confession-day-44/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Dec 2012 06:15:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/15/confession-day-44/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="101---chicago">101 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
&amp;ldquo;You.&amp;rdquo; It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the most cogent response I could have uttered, but quite frankly I was surprised to see Alex. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite sure why, he had made something of a habit of appearing and disappearing without so much as a moment&amp;rsquo;s warning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 43</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/14/confession-day-43/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2012 04:55:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/14/confession-day-43/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="99---rome">99 - Rome&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PRESENT DAY&lt;/strong>
Roaring past Michael and barely swerving to avoid Cerberus&amp;ndash;it bounded over me in a single leap, which helped matters somewhat&amp;ndash;I gunned the engine, considering all the while just how much trouble I would be in if I hit Lazarus with the Jeep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly as terrible if I just hit him, was it?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 42</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/13/confession-day-42/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Dec 2012 08:46:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/13/confession-day-42/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="98---baghdad">98 - Baghdad&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO&lt;/strong>
No.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was not going to die right here, right now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 41</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/12/confession-day-41/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2012 04:55:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/12/confession-day-41/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="96---rome">96 - Rome&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PRESENT DAY&lt;/strong>
Michael&amp;rsquo;s Jeep seemed to cut through what little traffic there was out and about so late as if it were nothing, cutting around vehicles where there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been room and avoiding pedestrians by hairs&amp;rsquo; widths or less. Yet no one seemed surprised or angry to see us whizzing by; in fact, no one seemed to pay us any mind at all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 40</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/11/confession-day-40/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Dec 2012 09:45:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/11/confession-day-40/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="94---chicago">94 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
Mrs. Claire&amp;rsquo;s looked much the same as it had not so very long ago when I&amp;rsquo;d been there last. The burn marks on the floor had been cleaned up and the lights replaced, but other than that it still had the slightly overdone psychic&amp;rsquo;s feel to it with that ever comforting glow of the neon pink light coming in through the window.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 39</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/10/confession-day-39/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Dec 2012 10:30:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/10/confession-day-39/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="93---baghdad">93 - Baghdad&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO&lt;/strong>
So what did that mean in the long run? I hadn&amp;rsquo;t the slightest idea. But in the short run, it meant that it was even less likely that the Sergent was going to believe that it had been Jackson that helped me out of &amp;hellip; wherever I had been.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 38</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/08/confession-day-38/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2012 23:30:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/08/confession-day-38/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="91---rome">91 - Rome&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PRESENT DAY&lt;/strong>
&amp;ldquo;And how are we going to find them?&amp;rdquo; I asked. &lt;em>Did Michael have some sort of angelic tracking powers?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He didn&amp;rsquo;t immediately answer, instead actually picking up his pace slightly. As I lengthened my stride to catch up with him, I realized that he was looking at something cradled in one hand.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 37</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/08/confession-day-37/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2012 04:55:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/08/confession-day-37/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="89---chicago">89 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
It turned out that Mrs. Claire thought that Alex had taken to haunting her business. Either that or possessing it. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly clear on the terminology but rather kept switching from one to the other. And I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that either particularly applied in this particular case.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 36</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/07/confession-day-36/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2012 08:42:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/07/confession-day-36/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="88---baghdad">88 - Baghdad&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO&lt;/strong>
The next voice to drift into focus from out of site was equally unexpected. &amp;ldquo;Father Tom?&amp;rdquo; It was Amira&amp;rsquo;s voice. Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t she be sleeping by now? She&amp;rsquo;d just had major surgery after all. At least I was pretty sure that Amira wasn&amp;rsquo;t dead. The idea of things having gone so sideways that she could have been killed here in the base didn&amp;rsquo;t even bear thought.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 35</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/06/confession-day-35/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2012 08:45:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/06/confession-day-35/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="87---baghdad">87 - Baghdad&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO&lt;/strong>
I can&amp;rsquo;t image how I could have looked more out of place, running through the streets of Baghdad late at night, wearing nothing more than that white, plain cotton pair of pants. I already didn&amp;rsquo;t look like I belonged, but this was just ridiculous. In all likelihood, that was what the people that had captured me had been hoping. Perhaps they&amp;rsquo;d thought that I&amp;rsquo;d just be too embarrassed to run away. Or something like that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 34</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/05/confession-day-34/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2012 09:45:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/05/confession-day-34/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="86---rome">86 - Rome&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PRESENT DAY&lt;/strong>
Despite threatening me with that particular bit of information about my immortal soul, he otherwise remained surprisingly close lipped on the subject. It did sound like a threat thought, the way that he said it, although I did doubt that was his original intention. To someone like him, it was probably no more than stating the way things were.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 33</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/04/confession-day-33/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2012 09:00:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/04/confession-day-33/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="85---chicago">85 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve seen him?&amp;rdquo; I could feel my heartbeat speeding up. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t realized how much hearing something like this would mean to me. It was validation. Someone else to share either the knowing or the madness with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But she just shook her head. &amp;ldquo;No. So far as I can remember, I never have.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 32</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/03/confession-day-32/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2012 09:25:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/03/confession-day-32/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="84---chicago">84 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
The next several days passed in a blur. At time, I could almost convince myself that the events of that one crazy night hadn&amp;rsquo;t actually happened. And then I would go to my desk and pull out the piece of pottery and the plane tickets that the mysterious man had left me. It was hard to doubt yourself when you had two nice solid pieces of physical evidence to pick up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 31</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/02/confession-day-31/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Dec 2012 04:15:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/02/confession-day-31/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="82---chicago">82 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
&amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo; Mrs. Claire asked first. She looked as surprised as I felt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you know?&amp;rdquo; The man didn&amp;rsquo;t look confused at all. More amused than anything. He inclined his head towards the cards lying on the table:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 30</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/01/confession-day-30/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2012 04:45:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/01/confession-day-30/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="79---baghdad">79 - Baghdad&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO&lt;/strong>
I made up the stairs with little trouble, but my heart was pounding the whole way. I was sure that at any moment the man from the cell was going to come through the door behind me and that would be it&amp;ndash;despite the fact that I had a solid lead up the stairs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 29</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/11/29/confession-day-29/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2012 20:10:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/11/29/confession-day-29/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="75---rome">75 - Rome&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PRESENT DAY&lt;/strong>
If the figure standing there heard the name, he gave no sign. The memories of exactly what Michael had looked like the first time had mostly slipped away, but I had just enough left to be almost sure that I was right&amp;ndash;and I have to admit, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thrilled with the discovery.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 28</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/11/29/confession-day-28/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2012 06:00:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/11/29/confession-day-28/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="72---chicago">72 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
In the end, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take nearly so long to explain things as I would have thought. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s the way things usually go, you always think that they were so very complicated and would take so long to explain until you actually try to do it. Then it turns out that there&amp;rsquo;s a simple way to say it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 27</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/11/28/confession-day-27/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2012 07:00:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/11/28/confession-day-27/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="68---baghdad">68 - Baghdad&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO&lt;/strong>
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have any artifacts.&amp;rdquo; Not only was it the truth, it seemed like it might even be something that he wanted to hear. &amp;ldquo;Pottery or otherwise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He just stared at me, not even so much as a blink in response.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 26</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/11/26/confession-day-26/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2012 11:00:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/11/26/confession-day-26/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="65---chicago">65 - Chicago&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO&lt;/strong>
At the moment, I was watching John Smith who was in turn watching his brother. No one was watching Mrs. Claire, so it came as a complete surprise to each of us when she suddenly started yelling in some angry kin to Latin. As I turned to look at her, there was a sizzling sound as a ring of some sort of powder in a rough circle around her started to light.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Confession - Day 25</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/11/26/confession-day-25/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2012 10:50:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/11/26/confession-day-25/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="64---baghdad">64 - Baghdad&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO&lt;/strong>
The tone of the voice completely threw me for a loop. Even worse, I thought that I recognized it from somewhere, although I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite place it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, I replied calmly enough. &amp;ldquo;Oh, well enough I suppose. I took a nice jaunt out into the city, managed to get shot a few times, ended up here. Speaking of which, where is here, after all?&amp;rdquo; It was really all I could do to keep from screaming at the madness of the whole situation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
