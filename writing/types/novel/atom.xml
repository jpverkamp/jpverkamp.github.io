&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been going for 2500 words per day (I know). It&amp;rsquo;s an intense pace, but I&amp;rsquo;ve done it so far. And, if all goes well, I&amp;rsquo;ll be done before Thanksgiving. Of course, I won&amp;rsquo;t actually stop then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Yup. Even with a new baby around, I&amp;rsquo;m mad enough to do it.
  So far I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping up 2000 words per day, but I&amp;rsquo;m already starting to feel a drag. It just feels like the same sort of story I&amp;rsquo;ve written before&amp;hellip; We&amp;rsquo;ll see in the next day or two if I try to reboot or just go with it.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet decided if I&amp;rsquo;m going to publish them online this year.</description>

      <title>Chapter 20 - The Morning After</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maxwell came to visit Andi in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her and Jenny had been given a shared room. The hospital had plenty of rooms and both of the women luckily had insurance that would have even covered a private room, but neither of them wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had just been through too much in the past few weeks to want to be alone. Andi still had that feeling running up and down her spine that Percy couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly be dead&amp;ndash;well, dead again if her suspicions were correct&amp;ndash;and that he&amp;rsquo;d just come after them yet again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Chapter 19 - Final Jeopardy</title>
      <link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/01/08/chapter-19-final-jeopardy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Somehow, they made it away from the train. They left just as the emergency crews were starting to arrive and cordon off the area. Anyone still there was being checked over by the medical crews first and then the cops after that. With how Andi looked&amp;ndash;covered head to foot in a tarry, black paste even after some had begun to dissipate&amp;ndash;she was sure they would have had all sorts of questions for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse yet, Officer Williams was one of the first cops on the scene. She didn&amp;rsquo;t think that she would ever see him again, not if she had anything to say about it. Not after he had stopped by and all but accused them of Ms. Morris&amp;rsquo; death. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be good, not at all, for them to be here, now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;She jerked her head up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maxwell stood there, towards the doors on one side&amp;ndash;the side without the demon banging at the door. She How had he gotten over there? Hadn&amp;rsquo;t he been thrown out of the train on the opposite side just a little big before? For that matter, hadn&amp;rsquo;t he been &lt;em&gt;thrown out a window&lt;/em&gt;? He looked absolutely none the worse for the wear. He could have just stepped onto the car, a normal passenger.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The three of them fanned out immediately, forgetting that less than an hour before they&amp;rsquo;d been doing their best to kill one another. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to realize what had happened thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laura&amp;rsquo;s car was gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to figure out what must have happened.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One might imagine that the two of you have a good reason for being here?&amp;rdquo; Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s voice was smooth and disturbingly calm. He didn&amp;rsquo;t seem at all perturbed by the forces arrayed against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, his demon &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; bigger after all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
