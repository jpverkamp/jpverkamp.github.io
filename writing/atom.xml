      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still doing it! Just not posting as much about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around, I&amp;rsquo;m writing sci-fi/cosmic horror, roughly based on a half remembered book I last read more then 15 years ago. Good times, no? Once this is all said and done, I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to go back and take a look to see how far I diverged.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NaNoWriMo 2018 - Special Collections</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It started with an idea from an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0637.html&#34;&gt;annotation on the Darths and Droids webcomic&lt;/a&gt; of all things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mysterious figure drops an overdue book in the library&amp;rsquo;s after-hours returns slot. Long overdue. 90 years overdue. It&amp;rsquo;s a book about the occult, and contains incantations and recipes for drastically extending life. The borrower&amp;rsquo;s last known address is that old &amp;ldquo;haunted&amp;rdquo; house on the hill outside town. Someone need to go investigate to recover the overdue fees&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a few hours outlining by hand (which I never used to do, but am starting to see the value of) and a month of crazy nights&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Magical number 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to write 2,500 words again this year, but with two kids (1 and 3) running around, time is somewhat lacking&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sixth time&amp;rsquo;s a charm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve done and won NaNoWri every year since 2011. Can&amp;rsquo;t stop now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can keep over the 1,667 word per day minimum again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://nanowrimo.org/widget/MyMonth/jpverkamp.png&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been going for 2500 words per day (I know). It&amp;rsquo;s an intense pace, but I&amp;rsquo;ve done it so far. And, if all goes well, I&amp;rsquo;ll be done before Thanksgiving. Of course, I won&amp;rsquo;t actually stop then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Writing Excuses 10.8: The Market - Planning</title>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is in the packages?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black powder mixed with something that will create lots of smoke. It&amp;rsquo;s an attack on the temple. When the packages are put into the flames (unopened, as is tradition), they will burn through and explode. As small as they are, it won&amp;rsquo;t actually cause much damage, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the point. Rather the point is to create confusion (especially with the smoke) so another agent can sneak into the temple and steal something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now take one of the characters with whom they interacted, and write the same scene again, but from this new character&amp;rsquo;s POV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My master is not always the brightest of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not in all regards, not in all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he paid for my mother&amp;rsquo;s transition, when there was no pressing need that he do such a thing. So far as I can tell, he didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what he was paying for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for that, I shall be eternally grateful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Writing Excuses 10.6: Second Place</title>

What was the process of thought that led to your loss? Now, replicate that moment in the dramatic structure of the story, except the story isn&amp;rsquo;t about games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The almost. The not quite. The second place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All words to describe a feeling. A state of mind. That of not quite making it, when you knew in your heart of hearts that you should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what makes it even worse: it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have been me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have been the one to make the run.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Convey their emotional states, their jobs, and their hobbies without directly stating any of those. The scene in question: walking through a marketplace, and they need to do a dead-drop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is not a place in which I usually find myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is noisy and rife with chaos, the throngs pressing into one another all along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet today I find myself in unusual circumstances, descending into those very same masses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The scene in question: walking through a marketplace, and they need to do a dead-drop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man that gave me the box wasn&amp;rsquo;t a very good man. He was tall and skinny and he smelled. But he gave me a shiny silver penny and said that if I took this box to the other end of the market and came back, he could would give me another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two shiny silver pennies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All for taking a stupid little box across the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is busy. Busy means pockets and pockets mean pennies and pennies mean dinner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t last nearly as long as I&amp;rsquo;d hoped with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/10/01/writing-excuses-10.8-the-market-planning/&#34;&gt;Writing Excuses&lt;/a&gt; prompts. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can&amp;rsquo;t catch up&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.writingexcuses.com/2015/01/25/writing-excuses-10-4-qa-on-ideas/&#34;&gt;Writing Excuses 10.5&lt;/a&gt; writing prompt&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Take three different characters and walk them through a scene. Convey their emotional states, their jobs, and their hobbies without directly stating any of those. The scene in question: walking through a marketplace, and they need to do a dead-drop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certain advantages that come with being dead. When walking down the street, people tend to give you a wide berth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don&amp;rsquo;t want to be reminded of their own mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don&amp;rsquo;t want to be reminded that death is no longer the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My target was on the other end of the marketplace, on the front steps of the temple to Acbris, God of the Sun. Ironic, all things considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Make sure they&amp;rsquo;re all different from each other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So what brings you all of the way out here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man on the other side of the table blinked. That was all the more reaction he showed, but it was more than I had seen since he&amp;rsquo;d entered the building.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old man watched the world end. He knew that he should have been bothered by this, he knew that he should have cared. But he was two wars and uncountable battles beyond caring. When he had been a younger man, something such as this would have mattered, would have gotten a rise out of him. Heck, that was the reason he had gone to battle in the first place wasn&amp;rsquo;t it? The first Great Incursion?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Yup. Even with a new baby around, I&amp;rsquo;m mad enough to do it.
  So far I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping up 2000 words per day, but I&amp;rsquo;m already starting to feel a drag. It just feels like the same sort of story I&amp;rsquo;ve written before&amp;hellip; We&amp;rsquo;ll see in the next day or two if I try to reboot or just go with it.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet decided if I&amp;rsquo;m going to publish them online this year.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maxwell came to visit Andi in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her and Jenny had been given a shared room. The hospital had plenty of rooms and both of the women luckily had insurance that would have even covered a private room, but neither of them wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had just been through too much in the past few weeks to want to be alone. Andi still had that feeling running up and down her spine that Percy couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly be dead&amp;ndash;well, dead again if her suspicions were correct&amp;ndash;and that he&amp;rsquo;d just come after them yet again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Somehow, they made it away from the train. They left just as the emergency crews were starting to arrive and cordon off the area. Anyone still there was being checked over by the medical crews first and then the cops after that. With how Andi looked&amp;ndash;covered head to foot in a tarry, black paste even after some had begun to dissipate&amp;ndash;she was sure they would have had all sorts of questions for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse yet, Officer Williams was one of the first cops on the scene. She didn&amp;rsquo;t think that she would ever see him again, not if she had anything to say about it. Not after he had stopped by and all but accused them of Ms. Morris&#39; death. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be good, not at all, for them to be here, now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;She jerked her head up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maxwell stood there, towards the doors on one side&amp;ndash;the side without the demon banging at the door. She How had he gotten over there? Hadn&amp;rsquo;t he been thrown out of the train on the opposite side just a little big before? For that matter, hadn&amp;rsquo;t he been &lt;em&gt;thrown out a window&lt;/em&gt;? He looked absolutely none the worse for the wear. He could have just stepped onto the car, a normal passenger.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The three of them fanned out immediately, forgetting that less than an hour before they&amp;rsquo;d been doing their best to kill one another. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to realize what had happened thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura&amp;rsquo;s car was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to figure out what must have happened.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One might imagine that the two of you have a good reason for being here?&amp;rdquo; Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s voice was smooth and disturbingly calm. He didn&amp;rsquo;t seem at all perturbed by the forces arrayed against him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, his demon &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; bigger after all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Andi blinked. &amp;ldquo;Break into&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; she said under her breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure you were coming back,&amp;rdquo; Laura said, speaking right over her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We did come back,&amp;rdquo; Andi said slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura nodded. &amp;ldquo;I see that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No. Earlier. We were already here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There was a sudden blur and a quick sound, something like the sound a whip might make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;thwip&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another blur and this time a thin red line appeared across the demon&amp;rsquo;s ink black flesh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;They arrived back at the winery nice and early. Too early in fact; the winery wasn&amp;rsquo;t scheduled to open for a solid hour after they got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Think we should just head on out?&amp;rdquo; Jenny suggested. There was no one else even parked at the winery. Granted, serving only sandwiches, wine, and cheese meant they didn&amp;rsquo;t have to do much so far as setting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andi considered. She didn&amp;rsquo;t want to head out there without Laura. Just in case they didn&amp;rsquo;t find anything demonic, the situation was going to be all sorts of awkward. But on the other hand, if Laura wasn&amp;rsquo;t here, they didn&amp;rsquo;t have to figure out how to get her to look the other way when they just walked through the walls&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s do it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t know the passcode?&amp;rdquo; Andi asked. She knew that Laura had said she was locked out, but somehow she still expected her to know the code. How else were they supposed to get in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura shook her head though. &amp;ldquo;I was hoping you might have a better idea.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andi couldn&amp;rsquo;t think why. The problem was, she did have a few better ideas. But they relied on either revealing their demonic powers or getting Laura to leave and on doing a bit of damage to the Clerk family shed. Neither was a particularly palatable first option.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Couldn&amp;rsquo;t you just have gotten his phone number or something?&amp;rdquo; Jenny was obviously joking, but there was just enough of an undercurrent of truth there that Andi couldn&amp;rsquo;t well ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As I&amp;rsquo;ve told you a dozen times, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t even have a physical body. How could he have a cell phone?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny smiled, but she wasn&amp;rsquo;t about to let the point go that easily. &amp;ldquo;Yeah, but he has to be some sort of demon or angel right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;She looked up at Jenny with a doubtful look on her face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s about what I thought.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And then?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It looks feasible. I mean, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing completely insane in there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Andi couldn&amp;rsquo;t help herself. &amp;ldquo;Dead?&amp;rdquo; She&amp;rsquo;d seemed perfectly fine when they&amp;rsquo;d been there. Who could she be dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The officer watched her for a moment more. She realized belatedly that he had dropped that particular nugget on them precisely in order to elicit a reaction. Hopefully surprised was the correct response…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything else, the officer continued. &amp;ldquo;Dead. The neighbors called us at about 3:30 pm about a potential disturbance. They said that they&amp;rsquo;d heard someone screaming and then several gunshots. When we arrived shortly later, she was dead.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;She found him within ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More accurately&amp;ndash;he found her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One moment, she was alone. At this hour, there weren&amp;rsquo;t many other passengers. The last of the daytime passengers had already gone home and the late night partiers had hours to go yet. She was the only person on the lower level of her car and there was only one couple on the upper floor. However, they seemed otherwise occupied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If she hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen her with her own two eyes, she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have believed it. The demon was still burning away behind them&amp;ndash;she could feel the heat&amp;ndash;but that meant&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Of course dear. Now, how can I help you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andi and Jenny looked at each other. Without a word, they moved together, doing their best to hide the still burning body behind them. Andi stole a quick glance behind her&amp;ndash;not long left now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After bandaging up her hand, Jenny brought up a point that Andi hadn&amp;rsquo;t even considered. Had Morris&amp;ndash;the old lady who owned the bookstore where Andi had originally found the book&amp;ndash;known about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had she had anything to do with the book showing up in Andi&amp;rsquo;s bag?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the more powerful the demon was you were trying to summon, the more complicated the summoning became. This was going to take hours of prep work and the better part of half an hour just to do the summoning. Honestly, she would have liked to take longer, but she didn&amp;rsquo;t know that she would be able to. The new chapters of the book had laid out what she&amp;rsquo;d expected&amp;ndash;the more you tried to add to a summoning, the less time you had to do it in. That seemed to set a hard limit on just what could be done, but it was hard to calculate. Perhaps there were exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The next morning, she didn&amp;rsquo;t even glance at the book on her way out of the apartment, instead opting to grab her own breakfast on the way rather than chance waiting in the kitchen. The idea of using her newly &amp;hellip; enhanced burner was there in the corner of her mind, but she wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite sure hot to deal with that just yet. Yet the summoning having been done had rather an effect on her.</description>

      <description>The last ingredient that Andi had to track down was the blood. She had a few ideas how to go about it, but none of them particularly appealed to her. Her best options at the moment were to go to a butcher and just flat out ask if they sold blood&amp;ndash;she thought that they might, to make certain sausages and other foods out of.
Alternatively, she could just a cut of meat and hope that enough drained out that she could get by that way.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Andi awoke the next morning, sure that the entire night&amp;rsquo;s activities had been a dream. Sure, she couldn&amp;rsquo;t particularly remember how she had gotten to bed&amp;ndash;or even how she had gotten home, if her memories of the bookstore and the train were not to be believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it had all been too ridiculous. A book that had somehow followed her home. The feeling of falling, even if it hadn&amp;rsquo;t come back. The man on the train; had he even been related to all the rest of it? A book that her cat irrationally hated&amp;ndash;and she couldn&amp;rsquo;t even read. Writing that wasn&amp;rsquo;t writing, at least until it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that title.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all started with a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t look terribly out of place&amp;ndash;it was a book store after all&amp;ndash;and Andi&amp;rsquo;s eyes just slid right over it at first. But something drew them back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yup, I&amp;rsquo;m doing it again. And this time, I&amp;rsquo;m doing it while finishing my PhD, working a full time job, and adapting to life two thousand miles away from where I was born. Should be interesting. 😄&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Spring NaNoWriMo – So close...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the month of March, I wrote 46,625 towards my newest novel. As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this one by hand, so it&amp;rsquo;s a bit slower going than typing, albeit with less distractions. So falling less than 10% shy of the (admittedly pretty arbitrary) NaNoWriMo target isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad. And I did hit my own goal of six hand written pages per day (I got 6.01). So none too shabby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do we go from here?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>March Madness NaNoWriMo - Halfway there</title>

I thought I&amp;rsquo;d just give a quick status update for that, since I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually been posting it daily this time around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My personal (NaNoWriMo) March Madness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back when I finished my last NaNoWriMo, I said that I&amp;rsquo;d be starting a new writing project within a couple of weeks. Well, here we are. It&amp;rsquo;s more than a couple of weeks later&amp;ndash;a bit short of two months actually. Unfortunately, I haven&amp;rsquo;t really written much. There was a short story and a few other blog posts and that&amp;rsquo;s about it. But that&amp;rsquo;s not what I want to do. I want to write.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Observers on Cydonia</title>
      <link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/02/19/observers-on-cydonia/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;They came without warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After so many years of finding nothing, the scientists had given up hope of ever finding life on Mars. Despite all of the probes, all of the rovers, Mars seemed destined to remain a dead planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spirit had been silent for years and it seemed that Opportunity would so follow on in its sister&amp;rsquo;s wake. Curiosity soldiered onward, drilling and lasering its way across the dusty ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each week it seemed, there was some new discovery; compounds from meteorites that revealed how the early solar system had come to be, ancient rocks that could only have been shaped by flowing water, deep in the red planet&amp;rsquo;s shadowed path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But never the Holy Grail, the one thing everyone wished for, even if they could no long admit to it in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never signs of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never the slightest hint that Earth may not have been unique in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;must eventually come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, at least I hope that this qualifies as a good thing. It&amp;rsquo;s the end either way. 😄&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PRESENT DAY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and licked my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was such a surprising yet so absolutely doggy thing to do that I barked out a laugh; I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t help it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRESENT DAY&lt;/strong&gt;
I could see the two of them struggling for control, each trying to force the Cup from the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far as I knew, Lazarus was still mostly human&amp;ndash;albeit able to appear and disappear in a most unsettling manner. Mr. Average on the other hand&amp;hellip; not so much. He definitely had something going on in the supernatural department.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
