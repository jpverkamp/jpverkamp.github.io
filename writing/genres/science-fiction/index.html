He had to have been close enough to take a shot at either Lillian or Jacobs, why hadn&rsquo;t he taken it? And where was he? There was still no sign of him anywhere&ndash;not a blip on either the shuttle&rsquo;s sensors or on <em>Borealis</em>&rsquo;. Well before they reached the shuttle bay, their conversation started looping back on itself and gradually faded into silence.
