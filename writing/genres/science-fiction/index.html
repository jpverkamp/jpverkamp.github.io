<p>After so many years of finding nothing, the scientists had given up hope of ever finding life on Mars. Despite all of the probes, all of the rovers, Mars seemed destined to remain a dead planet.</p>

<p>Spirit had been silent for years and it seemed that Opportunity would so follow on in its sister&rsquo;s wake. Curiosity soldiered onward, drilling and lasering its way across the dusty ground.</p>

<p>Each week it seemed, there was some new discovery; compounds from meteorites that revealed how the early solar system had come to be, ancient rocks that could only have been shaped by flowing water, deep in the red planet&rsquo;s shadowed path.</p>

<p>But never the Holy Grail, the one thing everyone wished for, even if they could no long admit to it in public.</p>

<p>Never signs of life.</p>

<p>Never the slightest hint that Earth may not have been unique in the universe.</p>

<p>Lillian awoke and was immediately struck by a strong sense of déjà vu. She was lying on her back in a hospital bed, just like the one she had woken up in&ndash;hours? days? years?&ndash;ago. Once again, she was strapped down, but more loosely than before. There was a little give at the arms and legs, although the band around her middle was just as tight as before.</p>

<p>There was no pain, which was curious. She wondered about that until she spied any IV with an innocent enough looking bag dispensing some sort of clear liquid into her arm. Must be some sort of pain killer.</p>

<p>The flight back was uneventful. Lillian and Jacobs took some time to talk about Watkins. It had almost certainly been Adrian, but why Watkins? He had to have been close enough to take a shot at either Lillian or Jacobs, why hadn&rsquo;t he taken it? And where was he? There was still no sign of him anywhere&ndash;not a blip on either the shuttle&rsquo;s sensors or on <em>Borealis</em>&rsquo;. Well before they reached the shuttle bay, their conversation started looping back on itself and gradually faded into silence. But it was the kind of silence between good friends&ndash;the kind of silence that they&rsquo;d used to share back before Lillian had gone off on the <em>Daedalus</em>. It was nice to finally find it again.</p>

<p>Once back out into space, Lillian settled down to try to figure out how this was even going to work. They&rsquo;d loaded dozens of metallic panels into the back of the shuttle, all carefully stacked. They were rather heavy now, but that wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem when they got there&ndash;Watkins could just shut the gravity plating off.</p>

<p>She pulled out the tools she&rsquo;d collected and arranged them neatly on the floor. Most of them she wouldn&rsquo;t need and there was only limited options. Mostly it was soothing. Organizing things always helped to calm her nerves. It took up most of the time on the short flight back out to the damage and by the time she got there, she was completely calm. Ready.</p>

<p>Except there was Adrian. That wasn&rsquo;t exactly calm-inducing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lillian, what is it?&rdquo; She heard Jacobs&rsquo; voice, but it felt far away, inconsequential. She floated on the ceiling, barely aware of time slipping by. Seconds, minutes, hours. Jacobs was talking, but she couldn&rsquo;t even make out what he was saying. What did it matter anyways? Quinn was dead and it was all her fault.</p>

<p>As Lillian shimmied into the suit, with Madeline&rsquo;s help, she took a moment to think about what was before her. She was going to have to leave the relatively safe confines of the <em>Borealis</em>&ndash;safe at least while the shields weren&rsquo;t disabled&ndash;to voyage out into the interstellar void. Outside of the ship, there was nothing. Not the sort of nothing that you could feel when you were in the middle of a deserted road deep into the night, but the crushing nothingness that the human mind isn&rsquo;t really equipped to handle.</p>

<p>For the first time, Lillian had been trusted with a solo mission to repair a damaged gravity plate. She gotten up that morning to check her assignments for the day and there it was:</p>

<p>LILLIAN SHAW - 0800 - REPAIR GRAV PLATE 1352 IN MESS</p>

<p>Her mentor finally trusted her! Today, she was extra careful as she collected her tools from the small chest under the bed in her bunk and fastened them around her jumpsuit. Tanaka-sensei had given her the belts&ndash;made with a mix of Velcro and elastic bags&ndash;and she loved them. A place for everything and everything in its place.</p>

<p>One last check to make sure she had everything and off she went. Her first solo!</p>
