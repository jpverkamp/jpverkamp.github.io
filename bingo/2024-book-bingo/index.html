Which isn&rsquo;t a lot, but it&rsquo;s weird that it happened twice.</p><blockquote><p><em>Fried Green Tomatoes</em> and <em>Steel Magnolias</em> meet <em>Dracula</em> in this Southern-flavored supernatural thriller set in the &rsquo;90s about a women&rsquo;s book club that must protect its suburban community from a mysterious and handsome stranger who turns out to be a blood-sucking fiend.</p></blockquote><p>Which probably should have clued me in.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating story that starts out fairly tame. A southern woman settled into a life of housewife&ndash;a life of long days, unthanked by her family.</p><blockquote><p>“Why do you pretend what we do is nothing?” she asked. “Every day, all the chaos and messiness of life happens and every day we clean it all up. Without us, they would just wallow in filth and disorder and nothing of any consequence would ever get done. Who taught you to sneer at that? I’ll tell you who. Someone who took their mother for granted.”</p></blockquote><p>And to brighten her days&mldr;</p><blockquote><p>Sometimes she craved a little danger. And that was why she had book club.</p></blockquote><p>That is, until a strange man moves in next door. With a mysterious aversion to sunlight.</p><p>Uh huh.</p><p>At some point, the book really gets into that &lsquo;runaway freight train&rsquo; feeling. There are some serious body horror scenes in this book and it gets increasingly dark. I mean, it started with biting an ear off, but it goes quite a bit further than that&mldr;</p><p>Yeah, definitely a horror novel.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed it. The American South housewife theme isn&rsquo;t something I read overly much and it it&rsquo;s interesting counterpoint to the vampiric horror. They&rsquo;re both great examples of &lsquo;pretty and polite on the surface&ndash;and absolutely <em>not</em> underneath&rsquo;.</p><p>Worth a read, I&rsquo;d say.</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/02/shutter/ class=clearfix>Shutter</a>
<a class="series-index taxonomy-value" href=/reviews/series/rita-todacheene><span class=series>Rita Todacheene</span>
<span class=index>#1</span></a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2025-02-02</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><blockquote><p>Grandma always said to me that you never do things for people to get something in return. That is the white man’s way of living. You do it because they need you. You do it because if you don’t, no one else will.</p></blockquote><p>Well that&rsquo;s quite a book!</p><p>In a word, it&rsquo;s an urban fantasy about a Diné (Navajo) forensic photographer that can see ghosts. But it&rsquo;s so much more than that.</p><p>First, I love the main character: Rita Todacheene. Someone that can see ghosts and a cop (or cop adjacent) is something I&rsquo;ve seen before, but it being a forensic photographer gave a particular poignancy to the whole thing. And the Diné angle was fascinating&ndash;I&rsquo;ve seen a bit of it in other urban fantasy books, but they have a particular way of looking at death which really plays interestingly against someone that can see ghosts!</p><p>As a bit of setting, the attention to detail on the cameras and the craft of photography was a really interesting touch. Rita, growing up poor but from a whole line of photographers. You really get the feeling she knows and loves everything about it which really gives a certain feel to the story.</p><p>Content warning though: We do get a number of descriptions of what exactly she&rsquo;s photographing. And some of those are <em>grisly</em>. At least we don&rsquo;t get the pictures? (I don&rsquo;t actually know for sure, I listened to this on audiobook&mldr;)</p><p>Structurally, the book alternates between the present day&ndash;Rita trying to solve crimes and stay mostly sane with ghosts hounding here&ndash;and the past: Rita&rsquo;s time growing up with her grandmother on a reservation, first coming to terms with life, death, and all it means to her specifically. It&rsquo;s a really nice contrast, pulling the two stories together.</p><p>Plotwise, it&rsquo;s not the most complicated of mysteries. You mostly have enough clues to figure out where this is going, but oh the ride to get there. It&rsquo;s still well worth it.</p><blockquote><p>I learned early that no amount of prayer or smoke or love was ever going to change the fact that these lights wanted to talk to me. Even at three years old, I knew it was something that deeply terrified my grandma and our medicine man. It was something that I was going to have to hide from them. As I got older, I taught myself how to look beyond the ghosts and mute their voices.</p></blockquote></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/06/frankenstein-the-1818-text/ class=clearfix>Frankenstein: The 1818 Text</a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2025-01-06</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><p>I&rsquo;m really going for that &rsquo;earliest published book&rsquo; for this coming Year in Reviews aren&rsquo;t I?</p><blockquote><p>It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another.</p></blockquote><p>Overall, it&rsquo;s one of those stories you expect to know what happens even before you read it. Frankenstein<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> creates LIFE in a form stitched together from dead bodies. But it&rsquo;s super ugly, so he drives his creation off. Said creation isn&rsquo;t a huge fan of this and goes on a murderous rampage. The end.</p><p>And yet, that&rsquo;s not <em>entirely</em> right?</p><p>It&rsquo;s an oddly formatted story to a much more modern reader. It&rsquo;s epistolary (told in letters and journals), which reminds me a lot of <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/29/dracula/>Dracula</a> and nested. We have letters from a sea captain, the account of Victor Frankenstein, and then finally <span class=spoiler>the monster himself</span>
.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a neat style, but I think a bit more could have been done with it. And it&rsquo;s never really a great sign when one of the main viewpoints (Frankenstein himself) is just hard to read. He&rsquo;s not likeable and depressed a lot of the time.</p><blockquote><p>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions, seems still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; yet, when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.</p></blockquote><p>Which again, I get it. But it doesn&rsquo;t make for a thrilling read.</p><p>It&rsquo;s billed as one of the earlier examples of science fiction, but it&rsquo;s not <em>really</em> science fiction. It does deal with the idea of bringing life&ndash;but never really gets into it. It&rsquo;s setting as much as anything, something to set the story in motion.</p><p>Alternatively, it&rsquo;s also called early modern Horror, but &mldr; it&rsquo;s not really horror in either the jump scare or thriller or cosmic senses of the word. There&rsquo;s some sense of inevitability&ndash;the creation is coming!&ndash;but it never really amounts to much.</p><p>Overall, I think it&rsquo;s worth having read mostly in a completionist sense. And really, I&rsquo;m glad I listened to this one on audiobook&ndash;they have a way of just keeping you going when you might otherwise get stuck and put the book down.</p><p>Onward!</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Not the monster, the Creator.

<span class=index>#1</span></a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2024-11-01</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><p>Whenever I come across a &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read all of <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-dresden-files/>The Dresden Files</a>, now what?&rdquo; discussion, one of the series that always seems to come up is Ben Aaronovitch&rsquo;s Rivers of London. They&rsquo;re not <em>entirely</em> the same, but I get why people cross recommend them.</p><p>Basically, we have a London cop who stumbles upon a mysterious killing, questions a ghost, gets recruited by the &lsquo;magical&rsquo; side of the London police, ends up meeting and befriending several rivers (see, the title! Also, it ends up making more sense in the story), and saves the day.</p><blockquote><p>“Are they really gods?"</p><p>&ldquo;I never worry about theological questions,&rdquo; said Nightingale. &ldquo;They exist, they have power and they can breach the Queen&rsquo;s peace - that makes them a police matter.”</p></blockquote><p>More or less.</p><p>I think my favorite part of the series (so far) is the humor, most especially the sheer Britishness of it (not being British, I have no idea how accurate it all is, but it&rsquo;s good enough for me!).</p><blockquote><p>He was from Yorkshire, or somewhere like that, and like many Northerners with issues, he&rsquo;d moved to London as a cheap alternative to psychotherapy.</p></blockquote><p>Oh, and also picking fun at it&rsquo;s own genre of course.</p><blockquote><p>“You put a spell on the dog,&rdquo; I said as we left the house.<br>&ldquo;Just a small one,&rdquo; said Nightingale.<br>&ldquo;So magic is real,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Which makes you a&mldr;what?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A wizard.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Like Harry Potter?&rdquo;<br>Nightingale sighed. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not like Harry Potter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a fictional character,&rdquo; said Nightingale.”</p></blockquote><p>Second up, the introductions of magic. Any world where the characters try to treat magic as a science and figure out <em>how in the world it <strong>really</strong> works</em> is a great one in my book.</p><p>There&rsquo;s an <em>awful</em> lot of hinted at worldbuilding there. I hope and expect to see a lot more of that in future books. We&rsquo;ll just have to see which way all that goes.</p><p>Also also, having recently decided that learning Latin was just a great idea as our main character (although for (un)fortunately different reasons I suppose):</p><blockquote><p>Carved above the lintel were the words SCIENTIA POTESTAS EST. Science points east, I wondered? Science is portentous, yes? Science protests too much. Scientific potatoes rule. Had I stumbled on the lair of dangerous plant geneticists?</p></blockquote><p>😄</p><p>Spoilers, I guess. 😄</p><p>Overall, I had a lot of fun with this book. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing where it goes from here!</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/10/bunny/ class=clearfix>Bunny</a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2024-10-10</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve got a theory&mldr; it could be bunnies.</p></blockquote><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gISEekxuEgk style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We never joke about bunnies, Bunny.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Man, that is quite a book.</p><p>It&rsquo;s part college experience&ndash;and not just any college experience, but one at a super small liberal arts school, focusing on writing and poetry and all that&mldr; to a degree that I (engineering school) couldn&rsquo;t even tell you for sure if it&rsquo;s satire or just <em>how that works</em>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s part a story about loneliness and fitting in&ndash;which ties in well with the college experience. About seeing the &lsquo;popular girls&rsquo;, first from the outside, and then all too intimately.</p><p>And of course (not that I knew this going into it; figured it out pretty quick though), it&rsquo;s part horror story. It&rsquo;s a slow burning thrilling, but there&rsquo;s more than a bit of the surreal and body horror bits of the genre.</p><p>All together, it&rsquo;s an intense sort of read, sort of like a car crash, but in a good way. (Yeah. I know.)</p><p>It takes a while to get going, slowly getting more and more&mldr; off. And then everything skids hard to one side. You just can&rsquo;t look away. You have to see what happens next.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed the experience.</p><p>I think.</p><p>Certainly not a book for everyone, but there are more than a few that I expect would get a (bunny?) kick out of it.</p><p><a href=/2024/10/10/bunny/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/04/perdido-street-station/ class=clearfix>Perdido Street Station</a>

China Miéville and Perdido Street Station almost always come up. Turns out&mldr; that&rsquo;s for a good reason. Why in the world did I take so long to read this book?</p><p>Overall, this book really shines when it comes to weird<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> worldbuilding.

Yggdrasil.</p><blockquote><p>“It&rsquo;s my fault," said Rune. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s untrained and likely to overdo things.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Like turning the queen bald.

A student and professor find an old manuscript purporting to describe a path to the very center of the Earth&mldr; and off they go to Snæfellsjökull (Icelandic is such a lovely language) and down into the Earth.</p><p>From that, it&rsquo;s one adventure after another. Down caves, running out of food and water, nearly dying&ndash;and all manner of completely scientifically improbable findings along the way.</p><blockquote><p>Science, my boy, is made up of mistakes, but they are mistakes which it is useful to make, because they lead little by little to the truth.</p></blockquote><p>I think the biggest difficulty in this book is probably entirely tied up with the fact that it&rsquo;s 160 years old. It&rsquo;s just written in a very different style. People just &mldr; don&rsquo;t talk like that. But it does make it feel amusingly old-timey, which I actually like. (I wonder how much of that is the translation?)</p><p>Worth a read. Going to have to read a few more of these!</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/04/16/sixteen-ways-to-defend-a-walled-city/ class=clearfix>Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City</a>
<a class="series-index taxonomy-value" href=/reviews/series/the-siege><span class=series>The Siege</span>
<span class=index>#1</span></a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2024-04-16</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><p>Yeah, this definitely fits this year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Judge A Book By Its Cover&rsquo; on the [[2024 Book Bingo]]. I mean&mldr; look at it! I love the title and have a soft spot for the illustrated manuscript style.</p><p>And then on top of that, it&rsquo;s actually quite a delightful book as well. Win win!</p><blockquote><p>I mention this because that’s how the world changes. It’s either so quick that we never know what hit us, or so gradual that we don’t notice.</p></blockquote><p>In a nutshell, it&rsquo;s the story of an alternate history Earth. Take a roughly medieval european tech level empire and an army corps of engineers (they build bridges) out on their own. Add a force somehow conquering everything, leaving said engineers really the only remaining hope. And then stick them in a city, the only hope to hold off against a siege.</p><p>But what really shines (for me&ndash;and your milage really may vary on this one) is the tone. The main character is competant (perhaps too much so at times) and wonderfully snarky.</p><blockquote><p>I have strong views about not tempting providence and, as a wise man once said, the difference between luck and a wheelbarrow is, luck doesn’t work if you push it.</p></blockquote><p>Things that have always been done? About to be undone&ndash;in the name of defending the city.</p><blockquote><p>My belief is, either you understand things or you understand people. Nobody can do both. Frankly, I’m happier with things. I understand stuff like tensile strength, shearing force, ductility, work hardening, stress, fatigue. I know the same sort of things happen with people, but the rules are subtly different. And nobody’s ever paid for my time to get to know about people.</p></blockquote><p>Yeah&mldr; he knows people better than he claims.</p><blockquote><p>The people turn out to be—well, people; a collective noun for all those individual men and women, none of them perfect, some of them downright vicious, most of them monumentally stupid. As stupid as the emperor, the great hereditary lords, the priestly hierarchs, the General Staff and the Lords of the Admiralty, the merchant princes and the organised crime barons.</p></blockquote><p>Anyways. You&rsquo;ll know right away if you like this book or not. I loved it. Give it a try.</p><blockquote><p>Of the people, by the people, for the people. I can’t remember offhand where that quote comes from; it was something to do with some bunch of wild-eyed idealists overthrowing the tyrant so they could become tyrants themselves. No good will have come of it, you can be sure. The people; God help us.</p></blockquote></div><hr></article><nav id=pagination-navigation role=navigation><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=First class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 1" class=page-link role=button>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/bingo/2024-book-bingo/page/2/ aria-label="Page 2" class=page-link role=button>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/bingo/2024-book-bingo/page/2/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/bingo/2024-book-bingo/page/2/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><footer id=page-footer role=contentinfo><nav id=footer-navigation role=navigation class=ribbon><ul class=main-navigation><li><a href=/archive-by-date/>All posts: By Date</a></li><li><a href=/archive-by-tag/>All posts: By Tag</a></li><li><a href=/atom.xml>RSS: All <sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li><li><a href=/bingo/atom.xml>RSS: bingo<sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li></ul></nav><div id=page-footer-content data-pagefind-ignore=all><div class=legal><p>All posts unless otherwise mentioned are licensed under
