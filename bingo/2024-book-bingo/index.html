There are some crazy fight scenes, a few light plot twists, a skeletal mouse that goes BONG<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, and &mldr; perhaps a chance to fall in love<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>?</p><p>Characterwise, man this is quite a cast. We have the Delly&ndash;our protagonist thief that can light things on fire&ndash;but the supporting cast are even better. Winn. A part troll illusionist/brawler&ndash;with quite the accent and past. Mrs. Totham, the <strike>Necromancer</strike> Body Scientist. The academic. The lady. The mother.</p><p>And of course Buttons.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll leave that one for you to discover, but each time I the narrator read &lsquo;Buttons said, ‚ÄúBong.‚Äù&rsquo; I found myself grinning. It&rsquo;s just weird and delightful.</p><p>Settingwise, it&rsquo;s quasi-Victorian, which is a lot of fun. The language is a bit weird at times, with quite a few unexpected &lsquo;fucks&rsquo; jumping out at you.. but apparently that&rsquo;s about when the term really started to take off and branch out, so&mldr;</p><blockquote><p>&mldr;her perception of egregious enfucktation in her current, present, and unfortunate familial circumstances&mldr;</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s a fun setting though, going from the cities you most often see in a Victorian style out into the country and back. I want to see more of this world!</p><p>Plotwise, I didn&rsquo;t expect the &lsquo;protection&rsquo; mission itself to take up such relatively little of the book. It&rsquo;s more an inciting incident than anything, but I&rsquo;m glad for it. When we moved on from that&ndash;I was not at all ready to move on from this book. It&rsquo;s all fairly straight forward (I expected a late book twist that never really materialized).</p><p>Overall, that was yet another delight of a book and if anything in this review struck your fancy&ndash;well worth the read!</p><p>Side note: This is apparently a sequel of sorts? Oops. From what I&rsquo;ve seen, it&rsquo;s more set in the same world with minor crossovers. But I&rsquo;m going to have to go back and read it now!</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>We&rsquo;ll come back to that.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>That&rsquo;s three books in a row with F/F relationships front and center.

I didn&rsquo;t expect that to work as well in an audiobook as it did, but each time I heard that little chime, I got a little smile.</p><p>Overall, another good read (on a bit of a run of those!).

Shesheshen sank more under her witch‚Äôs hat, and extended a foot. Once it was offered, Homily patted one of her meaty hands on Shesheshen‚Äôs calf. Why was she doing that? And why did it feel pleasant?</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s a concept worth enforcing, but I couldn&rsquo;t quite shake the feeling that it just didn&rsquo;t quite fit the whole &lsquo;monster who doesn&rsquo;t get humans&rsquo; thing and it jumped out at me.</p><p>On the other hand, I love how &lsquo;alien&rsquo; Shesheshen is (when she&rsquo;s not thinking about consent). She doesn&rsquo;t really have a body of her own, building it around whatever she eats (or finds lying around). The descriptions of how she builds around organs and puts them to her own use gets awfully gory at times, but is also a lot of fun to read.</p><p>Overall, it&rsquo;s yet another fun read and if you don&rsquo;t mind a bit of gore and a weird horror/romance mix, it&rsquo;s well worth it. None too shabby for a debut! (First novel; Wiswell has a few published shorts)</p><p>Side note: I &mldr; did not expect to find this was written by a man.</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/06/nine-goblins/ class=clearfix>Nine Goblins</a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2025-03-06</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><p>Oh, <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/t.-kingfisher/>T.

It&rsquo;s told from the point of view of a ragtag group of Goblins who suddenly find themselves <em>far</em> behind enemy lines, having to ally themselves with &mldr; a veterinarian of all things.</p><p>It&rsquo;s quite a funny book; the humor reminds me a lot of <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/discworld/>Discworld</a>&ndash;take that as the compliment it is.

A southern woman settled into a life of housewife&ndash;a life of long days, unthanked by her family.</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúWhy do you pretend what we do is nothing?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúEvery day, all the chaos and messiness of life happens and every day we clean it all up.

And that was why she had book club.</p></blockquote><p>That is, until a strange man moves in next door. With a mysterious aversion to sunlight.</p><p>Uh huh.</p><p>At some point, the book really gets into that &lsquo;runaway freight train&rsquo; feeling. There are some serious body horror scenes in this book and it gets increasingly dark. I mean, it started with biting an ear off, but it goes quite a bit further than that&mldr;</p><p>Yeah, definitely a horror novel.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed it. The American South housewife theme isn&rsquo;t something I read overly much and it it&rsquo;s interesting counterpoint to the vampiric horror. They&rsquo;re both great examples of &lsquo;pretty and polite on the surface&ndash;and absolutely <em>not</em> underneath&rsquo;.</p><p>Worth a read, I&rsquo;d say.</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/02/shutter/ class=clearfix>Shutter</a>

That is the white man‚Äôs way of living. You do it because they need you. You do it because if you don‚Äôt, no one else will.</p></blockquote><p>Well that&rsquo;s quite a book!</p><p>In a word, it&rsquo;s an urban fantasy about a Din√© (Navajo) forensic photographer that can see ghosts. But it&rsquo;s so much more than that.</p><p>First, I love the main character: Rita Todacheene. Someone that can see ghosts and a cop (or cop adjacent) is something I&rsquo;ve seen before, but it being a forensic photographer gave a particular poignancy to the whole thing. And the Din√© angle was fascinating&ndash;I&rsquo;ve seen a bit of it in other urban fantasy books, but they have a particular way of looking at death which really plays interestingly against someone that can see ghosts!</p><p>As a bit of setting, the attention to detail on the cameras and the craft of photography was a really interesting touch. Rita, growing up poor but from a whole line of photographers. You really get the feeling she knows and loves everything about it which really gives a certain feel to the story.</p><p>Content warning though: We do get a number of descriptions of what exactly she&rsquo;s photographing. And some of those are <em>grisly</em>. At least we don&rsquo;t get the pictures? (I don&rsquo;t actually know for sure, I listened to this on audiobook&mldr;)</p><p>Structurally, the book alternates between the present day&ndash;Rita trying to solve crimes and stay mostly sane with ghosts hounding here&ndash;and the past: Rita&rsquo;s time growing up with her grandmother on a reservation, first coming to terms with life, death, and all it means to her specifically. It&rsquo;s a really nice contrast, pulling the two stories together.</p><p>Plotwise, it&rsquo;s not the most complicated of mysteries. You mostly have enough clues to figure out where this is going, but oh the ride to get there. It&rsquo;s still well worth it.</p><blockquote><p>I learned early that no amount of prayer or smoke or love was ever going to change the fact that these lights wanted to talk to me. Even at three years old, I knew it was something that deeply terrified my grandma and our medicine man. It was something that I was going to have to hide from them. As I got older, I taught myself how to look beyond the ghosts and mute their voices.</p></blockquote></div><hr></article><nav id=pagination-navigation role=navigation><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=First class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 1" class=page-link role=button>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/bingo/2024-book-bingo/page/2/ aria-label="Page 2" class=page-link role=button>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/bingo/2024-book-bingo/page/3/ aria-label="Page 3" class=page-link role=button>3</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/bingo/2024-book-bingo/page/2/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/bingo/2024-book-bingo/page/3/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><footer id=page-footer role=contentinfo><nav id=footer-navigation role=navigation class=ribbon><ul class=main-navigation><li><a href=/archive-by-date/>All posts: By Date</a></li><li><a href=/archive-by-tag/>All posts: By Tag</a></li><li><a href=/atom.xml>RSS: All <sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li><li><a href=/bingo/atom.xml>RSS: bingo<sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li></ul></nav><div id=page-footer-content data-pagefind-ignore=all><div class=legal><p>All posts unless otherwise mentioned are licensed under
