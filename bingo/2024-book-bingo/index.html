I loved the worldbuilding and main character, I think if anything, it&rsquo;s far too short as a novella. I wanted more!</p><blockquote><p>Although, from what Teshar had heard, every pyramid was intended to be entered. People would want to bring offerings for the dead Emperor, servants would want to tend things every once in a while; a lot of people prayed to past Emperors, because they were easier to talk to than the pure gods, and more accessible than the living Emperor or Empress.</p></blockquote><p>The ever escalating tension of who Teshar (our main character) is and what she did to deserve to be treated like she is is fascinating (especially when you get to the why). I enjoy seeing the magic of the world escalating as we get to the obvious &lsquo;Teshar must save the day&rsquo; conclusion.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mldr;my mother, bless her kind, silly soul, once pointed out to me that pretty women look like everyone else, whereas beautiful women look like themselves&mldr;&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Overall, a fun story (that could have been longer). It&rsquo;s always interesting to find a solid self-published and little reviewed work just like this! Worth a try.</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/28/snow-crash/ class=clearfix>Snow Crash</a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2025-03-28</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><blockquote><p>We are all susceptible to the pull of viral ideas. Like mass hysteria. Or a tune that gets into your head that you keep humming all day until you spread it to someone else. Jokes. Urban legends. Crackpot religions. Marxism. No matter how smart we get, there is always this deep irrational part that makes us potential hosts for self-replicating information.</p></blockquote><p>Well that&rsquo;s a bit of straight up dystopian cyberpunk, straight out of the 90s. It&rsquo;s fascinating to see the mix of hope and fear when it comes to technology&ndash;virtual realitiies as both a way to dream and a means of control; a patchwork of corporate strongholds, each sovereign in their own right; a nuclear sidecar; a floating city circling the Pacific Ocean. It&rsquo;s a lot&mldr;</p><blockquote><p>This is America. People do whatever the fuck they feel like doing, you got a problem with that? Because they have a right to. And because they have guns and no one can fucking stop them.</p></blockquote><p>And then add on to that a mix of memes (in the &lsquo;viral/self-propagating idea&rsquo; rather than quickly spreading joke images) and linguistics. The Tower of Babel and ancient Sumerian. &lsquo;Programming&rsquo; the human mind. It&rsquo;s a fascinating idea, even if the fine details feel a bit off at times.</p><p>And then characterwise. Oof. Hiro is a nerd power fantasy. He&rsquo;s the best at sword fighting and a world class hacker and always wins.</p><blockquote><p>Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world.</p></blockquote><p>Also his name (or at least the name he goes by) is Hiro Protagonist. A bit on the nose?</p><p>I did really enjoy Y.T. though. 15 year old skater courier chick, street surfing and hitching rides on passing cars (etc). She&rsquo;s a fun and high energy&ndash;and it&rsquo;s a bit weird that&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s only 15.</p><blockquote><p>It was, of course, nothing more than sexism, the especially virulent type espoused by male techies who sincerely believe that they are too smart to be sexists.</p></blockquote><p>Overall, a neat story and a decent example of cyberpunk moving into the 90s&ndash;which admittedly I haven&rsquo;t read much of. It&rsquo;s been on my to-read list forever and I&rsquo;m glad to have finally read it!</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/23/the-dark-talent/ class=clearfix>The Dark Talent</a>

Or at least the last one that would be published for another 6 years! Now, in hindsight, it&rsquo;s obvious (and my kids&rsquo; totally already knew), but man. That&rsquo;s NOT AN ENDING.</p><blockquote><p>“Fine,” Grandpa said. “You fetch your evil Librarian mother from the jail. I’ll go warm up the giant penguin!”</p></blockquote><p>Ahem.</p><blockquote><p>“Well, that was fun,” Grandpa said as he climbed to his feet. “Anyone dead?”<br>“Does my pride count?” Draulin asked, dusting herself off.<br>“I don’t think so,” Grandpa said. “I killed that years ago. Dif, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but shoving my grandson out of planes is usually my job. So next time, kindly refrain until I give the word.”<br>“Sorry, sir,” Dif said, looking abashed.”</p></blockquote><p>The Dark Talent sees Alcatraz. Sans Dark Talent, off on a mission to save the world &mldr; and to save the girl. Just don&rsquo;t let Bastille hear you say that.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a lot like the rest of the series. New Smedrys (oh Dif), new worldbuilding (the HIBRARY! Beneath Washington DC!), new schenanigans (that is <em>quite</em> a library; also, rocket powered penguins), and a big new battle at the end (leading up to that oft forementioned SACRIFICE UPON AN ALTAR OF ENCYCLOPEDIAS).</p><p>But it&rsquo;s not the ending. And the ending can more than tell you that, which&mldr; is honestly getting kind of old.</p><p>It&rsquo;s doubly painful since not only did it end quickly, but it also ended painfully. In a series where guns put people in comas and main characters have magic powers seemingly purposely designed (hmm) to get them out of trouble&mldr; well, it&rsquo;s a bit of a shock.</p><p>It&rsquo;s still a lot of fun and I&rsquo;m looking forward to where in the <em>world</em> the series will <em>actually</em> end&mldr; For real this time?

Mrs. Totham, the <strike>Necromancer</strike> Body Scientist. The academic. The lady. The mother.</p><p>And of course Buttons.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll leave that one for you to discover, but each time I the narrator read &lsquo;Buttons said, “Bong.”&rsquo; I found myself grinning. It&rsquo;s just weird and delightful.</p><p>Settingwise, it&rsquo;s quasi-Victorian, which is a lot of fun.

It&rsquo;s more an inciting incident than anything, but I&rsquo;m glad for it. When we moved on from that&ndash;I was not at all ready to move on from this book. It&rsquo;s all fairly straight forward (I expected a late book twist that never really materialized).</p><p>Overall, that was yet another delight of a book and if anything in this review struck your fancy&ndash;well worth the read!</p><p>Side note: This is apparently a sequel of sorts?

Shesheshen sank more under her witch’s hat, and extended a foot. Once it was offered, Homily patted one of her meaty hands on Shesheshen’s calf. Why was she doing that? And why did it feel pleasant?</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s a concept worth enforcing, but I couldn&rsquo;t quite shake the feeling that it just didn&rsquo;t quite fit the whole &lsquo;monster who doesn&rsquo;t get humans&rsquo; thing and it jumped out at me.</p><p>On the other hand, I love how &lsquo;alien&rsquo; Shesheshen is (when she&rsquo;s not thinking about consent). She doesn&rsquo;t really have a body of her own, building it around whatever she eats (or finds lying around). The descriptions of how she builds around organs and puts them to her own use gets awfully gory at times, but is also a lot of fun to read.</p><p>Overall, it&rsquo;s yet another fun read and if you don&rsquo;t mind a bit of gore and a weird horror/romance mix, it&rsquo;s well worth it. None too shabby for a debut!

Backs against the wall, human beings are at their finest.</p></blockquote><p>That being said, it was a fascinatingly structured book. From the very first chapter, we know humanity (or what&rsquo;s left of it) eventually wins the war. Each chapter, we have comments like &rsquo;this is the last record of X&rsquo; or &lsquo;Y had a part to play yet&rsquo; And as we go, the various plots cross and come together, sketching out the end of the world and what comes after.</p><blockquote><p>I will murder you by the billions to give you immortality. I will set fire to your civilization to light your way forward. But know this: My species is not defined by your dying, but by your living.</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating book and I think well worth the read&mldr; and I&rsquo;m curious where exactly the sequel can possibly go next without more of the same.</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/22/exhalation/ class=clearfix>Exhalation</a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2025-02-22</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><p>Two years, two bingos, two <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/30/stories-of-your-life-and-others/>Five SFF Shorts</a>, both by Ted Chiang.</p><p>Man I love his shorts.</p><p>This one goes more scifi and deals more with time travel and parallel realities than the other (which had more scifi interacting with religion), but I love them both.</p><p>In particular, I <em>The Merchant and the Alchemist&rsquo;s Gate</em> and <em>Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom</em> were my favorites.
