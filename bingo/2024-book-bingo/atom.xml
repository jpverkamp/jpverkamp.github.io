First she went to studing dragons in rocky mountanious islands&amp;ndash;and almost died. And then she spent some time studying river dragons deep in the jungle&amp;ndash;and almost died.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now she&amp;rsquo;s off on a voyage around the world&amp;ndash;akin to Darwin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage%20of%20the%20Beagle">Voyage of the Beagle&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;to study dragons. Only to almost die not once, not twice, but at least three times. Assuming I didn&amp;rsquo;t miss any.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and have all manner of other adventures along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“I have never attempted to hide that I have had two husbands in my life. I have, however, neglected to mention that in between them, I had a wife.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In &lt;em>any&lt;/em> case.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“That should be my epitaph when I die: &amp;lsquo;she did not have to do it&amp;rsquo;.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m still loving riding along with the titular Lady Trent on her adventures and learning all about how dragons work in this world right along with her. And this time, she&amp;rsquo;s actually bringing her son along, which gives a whole new dimension to the journeys&amp;ndash;for the most part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fun book. I expect if you&amp;rsquo;ll like the first two, you&amp;rsquo;ll continue to enjoy this one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jade Legacy</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/04/06/jade-legacy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/04/06/jade-legacy/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“You&amp;rsquo;d think it would be easier to face death as you get older, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that way. You get more attached to life, to people you love and things that are worth living for.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Wow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I first read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/10/04/jade-city/">Jade City&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/06/jade-war/">Jade War&lt;/a> a few years&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> ago&amp;ndash;before the third and final book was out. So when I finally got a chance for a re-read (re-listen this time), I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give it a chance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And oh, does this book ever deliver. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me and have read the first two and not this&amp;ndash;what are you waiting for?&lt;/p>
