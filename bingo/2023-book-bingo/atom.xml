&lt;p>“Well,” said Crowley, who’d been thinking about this until his head ached, “haven’t you ever wondered about it all? You know—your people and my people, Heaven and Hell, good and evil, all that sort of thing? I mean, why?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“As I recall,” said the angel, stiffly, “there was the rebellion and—”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Ah, yes. And why did it happen, eh? I mean, it didn’t have to, did it?” said Crowley, a manic look in his eye.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Anyone who could build a universe in six days isn’t going to let a little thing like that happen. Unless they want it to, of course.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Oh, come on. Be sensible,” said Aziraphale, doubtfully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“That’s not good advice,” said Crowley. “That’s not good advice at all. If you sit down and think about it sensibly, you come up with some very funny ideas. Like: why make people inquisitive, and then put some forbidden fruit where they can see it with a big neon finger flashing on and off saying THIS IS IT!?”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The ANTICHRIST is born. ARMAGEDDON is coming! And all that stands in the way (for better /and/ for worse) is an angel/demon best friend combo who happen to /like/ living here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh it&amp;rsquo;s so good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve read quite a bit of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/terry-pratchett/">Terry Pratchett&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/neil-gaiman/">Neil Gaiman&lt;/a>, so reading a co-lab between them. Plus, I actually watched the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Omens-Season-1/dp/B089XW1Z6Y">show on Amazon&lt;/a> a while back, well before reading this book. From that order at least, it&amp;rsquo;s one of the particularly faithful and well done adaptations. Both being rather enjoyable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really can&amp;rsquo;t get Michael Sheet and David Tennant out of my head though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which is not a bad thing. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun ride, political/religious in exactly that fun somewhat blasphemous irreverent sort of way. I enjoy watching the ever increasing highjinks, as more plots get involved. The hundreds of years descendent of the one truly accurate prophetess. The Witch Finder Army&amp;ndash;somewhat reduced in manpower. The Four Horsemen&amp;ndash;and the dedicated deliveryman who sets them on their way. Plus the Other Four. And of course, the Antichrist himself. All these powers&amp;ndash;and no one ever taught him how to use them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun ride. You could do far worse than giving it a go!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Phoenix Extravagant</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/12/phoenix-extravagant/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/12/phoenix-extravagant/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Jebi was torn between saying &amp;lsquo;You are embarrassing me&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;I am going to take up my brush and make a painting of you that they will talk about for the next 10,000 years&amp;rsquo;. They said neither.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A world chock full of the history of China/Japan/China of a hundred years and change ago. Racism, colonialism, occupation, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A major take on artists during war. Both from the main character Gyen Jebi, an artist who fails to pass the examination for the Ministry of Art&amp;ndash;and ends up the perhaps much more interesting Ministry of Armor, making magical automata for the government. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating seeing a relatively common job turned extraordinary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course, the mechanical dragon on the cover. Arazi. &lt;span class="spoiler">Who is also a philosopher and pacifist, because of course they are.&lt;/span>
. There&amp;rsquo;s always something fun about relatively non-human characters like that. Probably the coolest part of teh book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course of course, there&amp;rsquo;s love. The relationship between Jebi and their captors, Vei especially. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting seeing the people who are perhaps all the more aware of the situation at hand and their relationships with the at times amusingly clueless Jebi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, an interesting book. I like the magic of the setting and the characters. The ending felt a little weird and weak, but it did wrap up well enough I suppose.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The studio also featured a large wall calendar with cryptic abbreviations, presumably reminders. Also doodles of gears, sprockets, and malformed genitalia, because artists were artists.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>The Infinite</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/the-infinite/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/the-infinite/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh that&amp;rsquo;s quite a conclusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“You’re creating hell. And you’re putting yourself inside it.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NEMESIS-1’s tone was serene. “Hell is the optimal solution.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/21/the-outside/">The Outside&lt;/a>, humanity found something Outside of the Gods&amp;rsquo; influence and managed to tear apart a large part of the world of Jai. In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/28/the-fallen/">The Fallen&lt;/a>, they learned to live with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/the-infinite/">The Infinite&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s time to learn more about the Gods themselves&amp;ndash;what they really are and how they came to be&amp;hellip; and perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s time for the Gods&amp;rsquo; reigns to end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating story and, in my opinion, perhaps the best of the trilogy. At once, we get answers for just what lead to the world that the characters live in now&amp;ndash;while at the same time opening so many more questions. What happened in the 700 years between the earliest and latest points of view in the book? What&amp;rsquo;s going on in the rest of the universe? And what happens next?!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But so far as this single story, it&amp;rsquo;s finished and well done. I always do applaud authors able to do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
