&lt;p>Jebi was torn between saying &amp;lsquo;You are embarrassing me&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;I am going to take up my brush and make a painting of you that they will talk about for the next 10,000 years&amp;rsquo;. They said neither.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A world chock full of the history of China/Japan/China of a hundred years and change ago. Racism, colonialism, occupation, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A major take on artists during war. Both from the main character Gyen Jebi, an artist who fails to pass the examination for the Ministry of Art&amp;ndash;and ends up the perhaps much more interesting Ministry of Armor, making magical automata for the government. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating seeing a relatively common job turned extraordinary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course, the mechanical dragon on the cover. Arazi. &lt;span class="spoiler">Who is also a philosopher and pacifist, because of course they are.&lt;/span>
. There&amp;rsquo;s always something fun about relatively non-human characters like that. Probably the coolest part of teh book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course of course, there&amp;rsquo;s love. The relationship between Jebi and their captors, Vei especially. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting seeing the people who are perhaps all the more aware of the situation at hand and their relationships with the at times amusingly clueless Jebi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, an interesting book. I like the magic of the setting and the characters. The ending felt a little weird and weak, but it did wrap up well enough I suppose.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The studio also featured a large wall calendar with cryptic abbreviations, presumably reminders. Also doodles of gears, sprockets, and malformed genitalia, because artists were artists.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>The Infinite</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/the-infinite/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/the-infinite/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh that&amp;rsquo;s quite a conclusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“You’re creating hell. And you’re putting yourself inside it.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NEMESIS-1’s tone was serene. “Hell is the optimal solution.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/21/the-outside/">The Outside&lt;/a>, humanity found something Outside of the Gods&amp;rsquo; influence and managed to tear apart a large part of the world of Jai. In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/28/the-fallen/">The Fallen&lt;/a>, they learned to live with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/the-infinite/">The Infinite&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s time to learn more about the Gods themselves&amp;ndash;what they really are and how they came to be&amp;hellip; and perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s time for the Gods&amp;rsquo; reigns to end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating story and, in my opinion, perhaps the best of the trilogy. At once, we get answers for just what lead to the world that the characters live in now&amp;ndash;while at the same time opening so many more questions. What happened in the 700 years between the earliest and latest points of view in the book? What&amp;rsquo;s going on in the rest of the universe? And what happens next?!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But so far as this single story, it&amp;rsquo;s finished and well done. I always do applaud authors able to do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
