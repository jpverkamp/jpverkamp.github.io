&lt;p>He is interested in the discoveries of science (“intellectual daring and imaginative brilliance without parallel”), the freedoms of democracy (in particular “the great democracy of reading and writing”), the evils of authoritarianism (“always reductive whether it’s in power or not”) and the pitfalls of education (“any education that neglects the experience of delight will be a dry and tasteless diet with no nourishment in it”). He is profoundly interested in religion, while remaining puzzled by aspects of it. “The first thing to say about the Bishop’s arguments in his book,” he writes in “God and Dust,” “is that I agree with every word of them, except the words I don’t understand; and that the words I don’t understand are those such as spirit, spiritual and God.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Philip Pullman is an interesting author, which makes Daemon Voices an interesting sort of book. In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s a selected collection of essays and presentation he&amp;rsquo;s given over the years on a wide range of topics. In particular, he talks a lot about Paradise Lost (makes me want to actually read it), his religious and philosophical views (and a dive into Gnosticism) and how those interact with his writing, and a bit on writing advice and his own particular style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating look and there&amp;rsquo;s a little for everyone, so if you like what Pullman has written, you can certainly do worse than give it a chance!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are a few interesting quotes that I highlighted for just about every essay. It&amp;rsquo;s not really the sort of book where one should worry about spoilers, but just in case that&amp;rsquo;s not a shared option, you have been warned. (Also: &lt;em>long&lt;/em>)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An Alchemy of Masques and Mirrors</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/08/an-alchemy-of-masques-and-mirrors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/08/an-alchemy-of-masques-and-mirrors/</guid><description>Well that was delightful. One of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;m really glad for the 2021 Book Bingo. I don&amp;rsquo;t know when/if I would have found this book, if not for that, and I really quite enjoyed it. It&amp;rsquo;s got great steampunky worldbuilding (with some hints of body horror I honestly feel steampunk should probably have more of), royal/courtly intrigue, wonderful characters, and some delightful writing (with a French twist to the word choices that I don&amp;rsquo;t see much of).</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 1: Original Sins</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/14/hellblazer-vol.-1-original-sins/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/14/hellblazer-vol.-1-original-sins/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>I really do have a thing for urban fantasy specifically dealing with demons and angels, good and evil, especially if it twists it all around. Constantine does that in spades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I watched the 2005 film well before I knew it was based on a comic (so sue me), so Keanu Reeves is forever going to be stuck in my head as the true Constantine, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also watched just about all of the new wave of DC shows, including the 2014 version of Constantine plus his appearances on Legends of Tomorrow. Not quite the same, but I still loved the character.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Red Sister</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/01/red-sister/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/01/red-sister/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>A gnome, a sprite, a wyvern, a green blob, a were-Pomeranian, and the Antichrist get sent to live in an orphanage on an island&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sounds like the setup for a rather strange joke, but instead the punchline is a delightful, amusing, and surprisingly touching story about actually taking the time to notice and perhaps care for someone a little bit different.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gideon the Ninth</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/13/gideon-the-ninth/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/13/gideon-the-ninth/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>One day eighteen years ago, Gideon&amp;rsquo;s mother had tumbled down the middle of
the shaft in a dragchute and a battered hazard suite, like some moth
drifting slowly down into the dark. The suit had been out of power for a
couple of minutes. The woman landed brain-dead. All the battery power had
been sucked away by a bio-container plugged into the suit, the kind you&amp;rsquo;d
care a transplant limb in, and inside that container was Gideon, only a day
old.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was obviously mysterious as hell.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You must understand how I felt then, how the surveyor must have felt: We &amp;gt; were scientists, trained to observe natural phenomena and the results of &amp;gt; human activity. We had not been trained to encounter what appeared to be the &amp;gt; uncanny. In unusual situations there can be a comfort in the presence of &amp;gt; even someone you think might be your enemy. Now we had come close to the &amp;gt; edges of something unprecedented, and less than a week into our mission we &amp;gt; had lost not just the linguist at the border but our anthropologist and our &amp;gt; psychologist.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now that is a fascinating sort of book. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a slice of life mixed with cosmic horror. The entire story follows an expedition into the mysterious, alien Area X. There&amp;rsquo;s not really any overarching plot, other than exploring and perhaps surviving&amp;hellip; and maybe if you&amp;rsquo;re really really lucky, coming back without going mad.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Six Wakes</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/19/six-wakes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/19/six-wakes/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>In a nutshell, &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="28962996" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28962996.six-wakes">Six Wakes&lt;/a> is a closed room murder mystery in SPACE! With clones! What that gives us is an absolutely wonderful variation on the tropes. Because of cloning technology, you can very well have a murder mystery where the cast wake up to the gruesome (zero gee) murder of &amp;hellip; the entire cast. And because it&amp;rsquo;s a generation ship in deep space, you very well know that one of the cast absolutely has to have been the muderer&amp;hellip; Unless it was more than one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My favorite parts of the worldbuilding all really revolve around technology of cloning and how that can change the world in fascinating ways. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon for attendees at certain parties to end murdered. They&amp;rsquo;ll wake up in the morning, restored from a backup the day before with little more than a feeling of &amp;lsquo;that must have been one hell of a party&amp;rsquo; plus some potential embarrassment and go about their lives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Project Hail Mary</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/15/project-hail-mary/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/15/project-hail-mary/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

There&amp;rsquo;s more than a handfull of glowing five star reviews and a smaller but still significant number that just didn&amp;rsquo;t get what the fuss was about. Halfway through&amp;hellip; I totally get it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the main problem is the absolute tonal shift that happens about halfway through the book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tales of Nezura: Book 1: The Zevolra</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/26/tales-of-nezura-book-1-the-zevolra/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/26/tales-of-nezura-book-1-the-zevolra/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the &amp;gt; shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you &amp;gt; could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices… &amp;gt; Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your &amp;gt; regrets?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a surprisingly wonderful story. It&amp;rsquo;s something of a mix of It&amp;rsquo;s a Wonderful Life and Borges' The Library of Babel. Nora Seed finds herself in a dark place, between life and death&amp;ndash;and that place just happens to look to her like a library. A library with a book for every life she could have lived, every choice she could have made.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wild Sign</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/13/wild-sign/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/13/wild-sign/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>The Mercyverse books (both Mercy Thompason and Alpha &amp;amp; Omega) are one of the few series of books I&amp;rsquo;ll come back to every few years for a complete reread, or in this case, a re-listen. Something that&amp;rsquo;s made all the better when you get to the end and there are new books to add to the old favorites!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the upside, it&amp;rsquo;s a crazy ride with a whole heap of more backstory for and reason to like Leah (some reviewers say it changed her backstory, but I think it fits), more information about witches, both white and black, and a few new crazy magical beings on the block (Bigfoot! Bigfeet? And that&amp;rsquo;s not even the crazy one&amp;hellip;). It&amp;rsquo;s a crazy world and a crazy plot and it manages to keep going all the way through.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Great and Terrible Beauty</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/11/a-great-and-terrible-beauty/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/11/a-great-and-terrible-beauty/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>Shall I tell you a story? A new and terrible one? A ghost story? Are you &amp;gt; ready? Shall I begin? Once upon a time there were four girls. One was &amp;gt; pretty. One was clever. One charming, and one&amp;hellip;one was mysterious. But they &amp;gt; were all damaged, you see. Something not right about the lot of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That was not at all what I expected. Granted, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect much. I&amp;rsquo;ve had this book on my to read list for years and decided to finally try it without looking at anything but the cover. Instead, we got a slow building paranormal boarding school / historic urban fantasy set in around the turn of the 20th century with a portal fantasy turned surprisingly dark.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Attack on Titan, Vol. 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/26/attack-on-titan-vol.-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 23:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/26/attack-on-titan-vol.-1/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>Off we go! I&amp;rsquo;ve heard good things about Attack on Titan, but other than some pictures of gruesome looking skinless giants, I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what I&amp;rsquo;m in for. It should be fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, it appears that the world was overrun by semi intelligent, naked, sexless humanoid (I personally think it would be all the more terrifying if they had genetalia, but for ratings and the mystery, I see why they don&amp;rsquo;t) Titans, ranging from twice as tall as a person to far far larger. What&amp;rsquo;s left of humanity (that we know of) is contained in a small(ish) city with a 50m wall. Good enough&amp;ndash;untl an EVEN BIGGER TITAN APPEARS:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
