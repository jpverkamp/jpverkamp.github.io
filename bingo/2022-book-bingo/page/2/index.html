I&rsquo;ve not read any T. Kingfisher before, but I&rsquo;ll have to remedy that.</p><p>In a nutshell, Nettle & Bone takes the idea of a fairy godmother&rsquo;s blessing at birth and twists it, bringing in the politics of unequal neighboring kingdoms; fae, their bargains, and all the twists that go with that; and a touch of demons and death magic. It&rsquo;s a fun world to build a foundation on.</p><p>On top of that, it&rsquo;s a wonderful cast of characters. I love seeing Marra, third-born princess, sent to a religious order (sort of), and originally on her own to solve the world&rsquo;s problems. Only for her to collect a motley band of strange and wonderful allies, each in their own ways: a witch, a reluctant godmother, a night, a dog made of bones, and a demon made of chicken. (It makes sense). They&rsquo;re all great and I love the found family dynamic as they&rsquo;re off to save the world&ndash;or at least some tiny corner of it.</p><p>As if that weren&rsquo;t enough, I love the prose and wordplay. It&rsquo;s <em>written</em> like a fairytale writ large. It just fits the story so well.</p><p>Overall, One of the best books I&rsquo;ve read this year and more than worth giving it a try.</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/ class=clearfix>A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians</a>

<span class=index>#1</span></a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2022-10-23</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><p>Well that&rsquo;s fascinating bit of historical fantasy. Take revolutionary era France, introduce various relatively &lsquo;common&rsquo; classes of magicians (fire, water, weather, mind control, etc), and see what shakes out. It&rsquo;s an era of history I&rsquo;m probably not as familiar with as I should be and, while with the introduction of magic things are slightly different, the events actually shake out more or less the same way (as I looked up later). It&rsquo;s interesting to read about people such as William Pitt and Maximilien Robespierre &mldr; and then read about them again in real history.</p><p><a href=/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-starless-sea/ class=clearfix>The Starless Sea</a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2022-10-05</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><blockquote><p>Far beneath the surface of the earth, hidden from the sun and the moon, upon the shores of the Starless Sea, there is a labyrinthine collection of tunnels and rooms filled with stories. Stories written in books and sealed in jars and painted on walls. Odes inscribed onto skin and pressed into rose petals. Tales laid in tiles upon the floors, bits of plot worn away by passing feet. Legends carved in crystal and hung from chandeliers. Stories catalogued and cared for and revered. Old stories preserved while new stories spring up around them.</p></blockquote><p><em>The Starless Sea</em> is an unfortunate sort of book.</p><p>On one hand, the prose is beautiful. There are some really wonderful passages and smaller stories that really sing on the pages. On top of that, there&rsquo;s a lot of delightful visuals described from the book. Often times, I don&rsquo;t really picture what&rsquo;s going on in a lot of stories, I more&mldr; absorb them. But this, this really needs and thrives on the visuals. Especially leaning on the sights and smells of books and libraries and doors, it&rsquo;s the sort of book a physical book lover (not a lover of stories, one of the actual physical books themselves) could really get into.</p><p>On the other hand&mldr; even after reading through the entire book, I&rsquo;m not sure what in the world was going on /Â what the point of anything was. A book doesn&rsquo;t have to have a point&ndash;I do love a good slice of life story&ndash;but this felt like it was trying to go for something. But with the absolute pile of characters (major, minor, versions of the same) jumping around all the time, it was hard to figure anything out. The prose and settings almost do enough to overcome that&mldr; but not quite enough.</p><p>So&mldr; I suppose it&rsquo;s a book that was almost really really good&mldr; but didn&rsquo;t quite stick the landing for me. It&rsquo;s probably worth a try, but if you bounce off the first few chapters, consider that it doesn&rsquo;t really change that much before the end.</p><p><a href=/2022/10/05/the-starless-sea/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/03/the-bone-ships/ class=clearfix>The Bone Ships</a>

In a nutshell, it&rsquo;s a world (or at least story) dominated by naval superiority&ndash;brought about by ships built on the literal bones of sea dragons. And what&rsquo;s more, the sea dragons appear to have been hunted to extinction, making the warships all the more rare and valuable.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a very cool root for the story and Barker only takes it from there with unique twists on vocab and word choice, a few other interesting bits of magic, and more naval everything than you can shake some paint at.</p><p>I do quite enjoy the characters as well. Setting the story around a prison ship? Not that unusual, but I really do love how much Barker makes the reader care for the people on it&ndash;and to see them grow together as a grow. Lucky Maes is of course awesome as well&ndash;and I do love the more alien birdman. Want to see what more is going on there for sure.</p><p>Overall, a great book and I&rsquo;m glad to have read it. Onward to the sequels!</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/28/out-of-the-blue/ class=clearfix>Out of the Blue</a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2022-07-28</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><p>Take part gay teenage lifeguard lover of rom-coms, just broken up with the Love Of His Life(tm), add a non-binary (because they all are) mermaid, sent on a month long <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumspringa>Rumspringa</a> to the surface, make it into a love story (of course) with all the (teenage) relationship twists and turns that entails<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>&mldr; and you have <em>Out of the Blue</em>.</p><p>That &mldr; is not at all the sort of book I normally find myself drawn to (I picked it up for the <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/bingo/2022-book-bingo/>2022 Book Bingo</a>), but you know&mldr; It&rsquo;s actually kind of sweet.

Some of our old friends (more or less) are dead, some are broken, and some &mldr; miraculously seem to have gotten everything they wanted in life. There are more surprises and political shifts than one knows how to deal with, a chunk more of world building around the First and Second Laws, and all manner of battles and death and destruction.</p><p>It remains fascinating what Abercrombie can do with characters. Glokta is a terrible person&ndash;and he makes us root for him. Logen is a berserker in the truest sense&ndash;and he makes us feel sorry for him. Jezal is excellent at failing upward&ndash;and he makes us feel sorry for him.

Chaos was the only sensible conclusion. There was no law that was just in every situation, no blanket rule that could apply to everyone, no explanation that accounted for every component. This did not mean that laws and rules were not helpful, or that explanations should not be sought, but rather that there should be no fear in changing them as needed, for nothing in the universe ever held still.</p></blockquote><p>Oh, I do love these books. Especially on audio. There just such a delightful take on the sci-fi &lsquo;slice of life&rsquo; genre. Once again, it&rsquo;s a new cast and new stories, with loose tiebacks to the previous characters (seeing Pei and hearing her talk about Ashby is a nice change of view). Chambers really shines at taking a bunch of weird and wonderful aliens, sticking them in a tight space (this time what&rsquo;s essentially a &lsquo;space truck stop&rsquo;) for a few days, and seeing what happens. Nothing earthshaking<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> or deadly<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>, but a lot of interpersonal drama.
