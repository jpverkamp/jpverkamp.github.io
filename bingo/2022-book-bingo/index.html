He&rsquo;s a Raksura, a being capable of transforming between a more or less human form (although I don&rsquo;t get the feeling there are any real &lsquo;humans&rsquo; in this book) and a much larger stronger winged form.

One that allowed everyone to push any inconvenience to another place or another generation.</p></blockquote><p>The Vela is part of a fascinating sort of new/old model: serialized fiction. In this case <a href=https://www.realm.fm/>Realm.fm (formerly Serial Box)</a> is putting out piles of audio fiction by a number of well known authors chapter by chapter. And yet&mldr; somehow I read the ebook version from the library. I really should check out the audio versions.</p><p>In any case, The worldbuilding (as in the above quote) in the Vela is fascinating. A nearish-future tech sci-fi universe where humanity has managed to extract enough resources from the local star to freeze out the outer planets, wrecking all manner of havoc among the people that live out there. There&rsquo;s all manner of classism, racism, and other racisms to digest&mldr;</p><p>Set against the backdrop of a missing starship (the Vela) and the two unlikely companions (Asala and Niko) who are sent to go find it. I&rsquo;m glad to see Becky Chambers as one of the authors here, I really love how she does &lsquo;people stories&rsquo;. I haven&rsquo;t yet read the other three authors, but they&rsquo;re all on my to-read shelf already and higher up now. ðŸ˜„</p><p>The relationship between Asala (hard bitten mercenary/sniper) and Nike (child of the president; hacker) throughout the stories is really the shining jewel of the series. It&rsquo;s interesting to see the slight (IMO) variations between how the different authors see and write them, but it&rsquo;s still well worth reading.</p><p>Well well worth a read. Or a listen. And Season 2 is on Realm? Onward!</p><blockquote><p>People spoke about the death of planets as if the rock itself would shatter, but the truth was never so dramatic. The entire sphere wasn&rsquo;t in danger of ceasing to exist. All that mattered was the inner goings-on of that tiny strip of gauze, that onion skin of atmosphere clinging to the rocky surface like morning dew. The narrowest of margins on which everything depended.</p></blockquote><p><a href=/2023/02/22/the-vela/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/21/runaways-vol.-1-pride-and-joy/ class=clearfix>Runaways, Vol. 1: Pride and Joy</a>

It&rsquo;s been on my list for a while, so I figured I&rsquo;d give it a chance and I&rsquo;m so very glad I did.</p><p>I highly recommend the book, with the disclaimer that there are some dark scenes, bits (sorry) of body horror, and quite a lot of (made up fantasy) swearing.</p><p><a href=/2022/12/06/foundryside/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/01/nettle-bone/ class=clearfix>Nettle & Bone</a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2022-11-01</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><blockquote><p>The trees were full of crows and the woods were full of madmen.</p><p>The pit was full of bones and her hands were full of wires.</p></blockquote><p>Well that was a delightful surprise&ndash;in a dark fairytale kind of way. I&rsquo;ve not read any T. Kingfisher before, but I&rsquo;ll have to remedy that.</p><p>In a nutshell, Nettle & Bone takes the idea of a fairy godmother&rsquo;s blessing at birth and twists it, bringing in the politics of unequal neighboring kingdoms; fae, their bargains, and all the twists that go with that; and a touch of demons and death magic. It&rsquo;s a fun world to build a foundation on.</p><p>On top of that, it&rsquo;s a wonderful cast of characters. I love seeing Marra, third-born princess, sent to a religious order (sort of), and originally on her own to solve the world&rsquo;s problems. Only for her to collect a motley band of strange and wonderful allies, each in their own ways: a witch, a reluctant godmother, a night, a dog made of bones, and a demon made of chicken. (It makes sense). They&rsquo;re all great and I love the found family dynamic as they&rsquo;re off to save the world&ndash;or at least some tiny corner of it.</p><p>As if that weren&rsquo;t enough, I love the prose and wordplay. It&rsquo;s <em>written</em> like a fairytale writ large. It just fits the story so well.</p><p>Overall, One of the best books I&rsquo;ve read this year and more than worth giving it a try.</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/ class=clearfix>A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians</a>

Take revolutionary era France, introduce various relatively &lsquo;common&rsquo; classes of magicians (fire, water, weather, mind control, etc), and see what shakes out. It&rsquo;s an era of history I&rsquo;m probably not as familiar with as I should be and, while with the introduction of magic things are slightly different, the events actually shake out more or less the same way (as I looked up later). It&rsquo;s interesting to read about people such as William Pitt and Maximilien Robespierre &mldr; and then read about them again in real history.</p><p><a href=/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-starless-sea/ class=clearfix>The Starless Sea</a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2022-10-05</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><blockquote><p>Far beneath the surface of the earth, hidden from the sun and the moon, upon the shores of the Starless Sea, there is a labyrinthine collection of tunnels and rooms filled with stories. Stories written in books and sealed in jars and painted on walls. Odes inscribed onto skin and pressed into rose petals. Tales laid in tiles upon the floors, bits of plot worn away by passing feet. Legends carved in crystal and hung from chandeliers. Stories catalogued and cared for and revered. Old stories preserved while new stories spring up around them.</p></blockquote><p><em>The Starless Sea</em> is an unfortunate sort of book.</p><p>On one hand, the prose is beautiful. There are some really wonderful passages and smaller stories that really sing on the pages. On top of that, there&rsquo;s a lot of delightful visuals described from the book. Often times, I don&rsquo;t really picture what&rsquo;s going on in a lot of stories, I more&mldr; absorb them. But this, this really needs and thrives on the visuals. Especially leaning on the sights and smells of books and libraries and doors, it&rsquo;s the sort of book a physical book lover (not a lover of stories, one of the actual physical books themselves) could really get into.</p><p>On the other hand&mldr; even after reading through the entire book, I&rsquo;m not sure what in the world was going on /Â what the point of anything was. A book doesn&rsquo;t have to have a point&ndash;I do love a good slice of life story&ndash;but this felt like it was trying to go for something. But with the absolute pile of characters (major, minor, versions of the same) jumping around all the time, it was hard to figure anything out. The prose and settings almost do enough to overcome that&mldr; but not quite enough.</p><p>So&mldr; I suppose it&rsquo;s a book that was almost really really good&mldr; but didn&rsquo;t quite stick the landing for me. It&rsquo;s probably worth a try, but if you bounce off the first few chapters, consider that it doesn&rsquo;t really change that much before the end.</p><p><a href=/2022/10/05/the-starless-sea/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><nav id=pagination-navigation role=navigation><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=First class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 1" class=page-link role=button>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/bingo/2022-book-bingo/page/2/ aria-label="Page 2" class=page-link role=button>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/bingo/2022-book-bingo/page/3/ aria-label="Page 3" class=page-link role=button>3</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/bingo/2022-book-bingo/page/2/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/bingo/2022-book-bingo/page/3/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><footer id=page-footer role=contentinfo><nav id=footer-navigation role=navigation class=ribbon><ul class=main-navigation><li><a href=/archive-by-date/>All posts: By Date</a></li><li><a href=/archive-by-tag/>All posts: By Tag</a></li><li><a href=/atom.xml>RSS: All <sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li><li><a href=/bingo/atom.xml>RSS: bingo<sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li></ul></nav><div id=page-footer-content><div class=legal><p>All posts unless otherwise mentioned are licensed under
