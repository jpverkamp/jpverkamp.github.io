Enter &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html">procedural macros&lt;/a>. In a nutshell, procedural macros in Rust, rather than relying entirely on pattern matching and expansion are fully Rust functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They take a specific input (a stream of tokens) and output a specific output (a new stream of tokens), but in between they can do just about anything a full Rust function can do. And what&amp;rsquo;s better yet&amp;hellip; they operate at compile time. And because they operate on tokens (rather than a full AST), you can do things that just aren&amp;rsquo;t syntactically valid in normal Rust. Things like&amp;hellip; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/variadic%20functions">variadic functions&lt;/a> (a la &lt;code>print!&lt;/code> or &lt;code>var!&lt;/code>) or even crazier things like &lt;a href="https://docs.rs/inline-python/latest/inline_python/">embedding Python in Rust&lt;/a> for &amp;hellip; reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today specifically, I&amp;rsquo;ve started working through the &lt;a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/proc-macro-workshop">prod-macro-workshop&lt;/a> repo. It&amp;rsquo;s a series of five examples macros with test cases and some guidance set up to help you get up to speed. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be working through the first of these: &lt;code>derive(Builder)&lt;/code>. Now don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. I really have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, so don&amp;rsquo;t take this as an example of &lt;em>how to write a macro&lt;/em>. But perhaps by writing this out, it will help me learn it better&amp;hellip; and if you happen to learn something as well, all the better!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
