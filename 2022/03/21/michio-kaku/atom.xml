It goes into a wide variety of primarily science fictional topics in decreasingly order of likelihood and gets into how each works (so far as they do work with what we know now) and what it would take to make them possible. There&amp;rsquo;s just enough scientific background that I understood most of it and could stretch for the rest, with pointers for what to search for to learn more, which is always a good way to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read! One interesting point is how many of these seeded ideas for more stories in the future! Onward!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
