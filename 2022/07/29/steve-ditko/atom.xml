That&amp;rsquo;s what what you get if you take a &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/directors/sam-raimi">director best known for his horror movies&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and let them loose in the MCU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like it. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Man: No Way Home</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/18/spider-man-no-way-home/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/18/spider-man-no-way-home/</guid><description>&lt;p>Finally got around to watching this. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did, it&amp;rsquo;s hilarious and an aboslute blast of nostalgia. Similar to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/29/avengers-endgame/">Avengers: Endgame&lt;/a>, I don&amp;rsquo;t know know if this would possibly hold up without the weight of all of the movies that came before it (I doubt it), but with that weight&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s really really good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s funny, it&amp;rsquo;s touching, and there are some really crazy action scenes. But the greatest strength of course comes from &lt;span class="spoiler">bringing back a half dozen villains and all three modern live action Spider-Men into one film&lt;/span>
. Would anyone have believed something that crazy possible, especially before Infinity War/Endgame? I doubt it. But it&amp;rsquo;s quite satisfying.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Man: Far From Home</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/30/spider-man-far-from-home/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/30/spider-man-far-from-home/</guid><description>&lt;p>As much as I loved &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/29/spider-man-homecoming/">Spider-Man: Homecoming&lt;/a>, Spider-Man: Far From Home takes what made it great and turns it up a few levels &lt;em>even further&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One one level, you have Spider-Man being Spider-Man. He&amp;rsquo;s a good kid, trying to make his way in life, trying to deal with the dual life of being a highschooler and being a superhero&amp;ndash;of saving the world and perhaps getting the girl.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then you layer all the weight of the greater MCU on top of it. This takes place just after &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/29/avengers-endgame/">Avengers: Endgame&lt;/a>. So you have the fallout of Iron Man (Spider-Man&amp;rsquo;s mentor/Uncle Ben figure) being gone and Spider-Man having to step into &lt;em>those&lt;/em> shoes, the first big mention of The Blip&amp;ndash;and how you deal with coming back and the world has changed, and all sorts of dealing with a Nick Fury who&amp;rsquo;s lost several of his heaviest hitters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Man: Homecoming</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/29/spider-man-homecoming/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/29/spider-man-homecoming/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>That&lt;/em> is a truly delightful Spider-Man movie. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird seeing him introduced &lt;em>after&lt;/em> the events of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/03/captain-america-civil-war/">Captain America: Civil War&lt;/a>) and completely skipping how he became Spider-Man in the first place&amp;hellip; but it works. I really like the entire plot, dealing with the fallout of the Avengers / super-hero activity and how normal people try to live their lives around it&amp;ndash;and what happens when the powers that be step in and take that away from them. Excellent villain fuel. It&amp;rsquo;s a little silly that &lt;span class="spoiler">the Vulture ends up being Spider-Man's crush's father...&lt;/span>
, but I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s the sort of thing you expect from superhero films. Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s a solid, fun action film.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doctor Strange</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/10/doctor-strange/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/10/doctor-strange/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Wong: While heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers, we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Man, that is a visually stunning movie. The first battle with building magically twisting all over (a la Inception), the glowing magic rings, the magical doodads. I am ever thankful that superhero movies have gotten popular enough that studios will spend the big bucks on special effects. They really do look great.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/05/10/the-amazing-spider-man-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/05/10/the-amazing-spider-man-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>I think that&amp;ndash;for once&amp;ndash;I was the perfect audience for this movie. Just geeky enough that I enjoy a good Spider-Man movie, but not so geeky that whatever changes they made from the comics are going to jump out / particularly bother me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Amazing Spider-Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/07/23/the-amazing-spider-man/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jul 2012 04:55:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/07/23/the-amazing-spider-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>Why do we have another Spider-Man movie? Granted, I liked it more than any of the previous three, but it just feels too soon. Of course people are going to compare it to the previous movies.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
