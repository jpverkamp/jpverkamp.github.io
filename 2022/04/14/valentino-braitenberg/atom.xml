&lt;p>This is an exercise in fictional science, or science fiction, if you like that better. Not for amusement: science fiction in the service of science. Or just science, if you agree that fiction is part of it, always was, and always will be as long as our brains are only minuscule fragments of the universe, much too small to hold all the facts of the world but not too idle to speculate about them.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What am I in for…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it’s an interesting read. In a nutshell, it builds up a model for ‘vehicles’ that start with a single wheel and basic sensor and grows, adding better senses and in particular a more and more complicated brain. I would have liked something a bit more technical and/or practical but there are a lot of interesting ideas here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One downside, the wording is … a bit pretentious at times. Academic is probably a better word. Above is the first paragraph.. and that’s really how it stays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, an interesting enough and surprisingly quick read.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
