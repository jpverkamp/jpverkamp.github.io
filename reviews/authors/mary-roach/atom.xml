&lt;p>Death. It doesn’t have to be boring.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s quite a book. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to try out one of Mary Roach&amp;rsquo;s books for a while and this one came up on the (digital) library, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a try. In a nutshell, it goes into the process of what happens right up to and after you die (including brain death and organ donation) along with the various things that might be done with your body afterwards (such as medical training and testing various products along with alternatives to burial).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“What I do is, I think of them as wax.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Theresa is practicing a time-honored coping method: objectification. For those who must deal with human corpses regularly, it is easier (and, I suppose, more accurate) to think of them as objects, not people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating look into things you just don&amp;rsquo;t often think of. I quite enjoyed it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
