&lt;p>Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Take the extremist end of the American Protestant religious right. Give them everything they want (plus some) over the span of years (if not months).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Men have taken absolute power. In a world with (dramatically) declining birth rates, women are owned by the state. Their bodies are nothing more than a vessel for their wombs. They can&amp;rsquo;t travel alone, can&amp;rsquo;t be seen, can&amp;rsquo;t own property.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like any good story of this sort, it takes a potential problem&amp;ndash;an idea&amp;ndash;and turns it up to eleven. It goes steps further than anything we&amp;rsquo;ve seen in modern times&amp;ndash;or at least differently. The closest analogue I&amp;rsquo;m aware of is probably the events around the Iranian Revolution in 1979. By 1981, hijab were mandatory (there&amp;rsquo;s more to the history there; even before, hijab were seen as a method of protest against Westernization). Given this book was released in 1985, it seems&amp;hellip; potentially related.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; terrifying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the more so, for all those men (often in positions of power) that even today see it less as a cautionary tale and more something to aspire to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oy.&lt;/p>
