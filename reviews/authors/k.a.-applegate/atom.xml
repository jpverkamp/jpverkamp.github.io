Two in a row I don&amp;rsquo;t overly care for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, we have Jake out of town&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;A vote,&amp;gt; Tobias said. &amp;lt;It&amp;rsquo;s the only way.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marco snorted. &amp;ldquo;Beautiful. Let&amp;rsquo;s see. We&amp;rsquo;ve got Rachel&amp;rsquo;s best friend and her bird-friend and Ax isn&amp;rsquo;t voting . . . forget it, man. I&amp;rsquo;m out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marco turned to me and bowed. &amp;ldquo;Congratulations, your highness. Your wish is my command.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And for some reason Rachel steps up. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to agree with Marco too strongly here&amp;hellip; but this is a bad idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hit and run, almost get killed, learn a lesson.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And away we go!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Mutation</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/28/the-mutation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/28/the-mutation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Okay, just &lt;em>how many&lt;/em> alien (and otherwise) species &lt;em>are&lt;/em> there on the Earth?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, at lesat one more&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At some point, it seems we have to do every possible historical weirdness. Which this time involves Atlantis. And it&amp;rsquo;s every bit as weird and fishy as you might expect &amp;rsquo;the Animorphs do Atlantis&amp;rsquo; would be&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Look, I don&amp;rsquo;t know about anyone else, but I believe in listening to my instincts. And my instincts are saying, &amp;lsquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve done enough, Marco. Go home. Play with the stupid poodle. Do some homework.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I get the same feeling, Marco,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;But we almost got killed trying to take out the Sea Blade. I don&amp;rsquo;t want a rematch. I want it sunk. I want to know it&amp;rsquo;s sunk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; not my favorite. Weird worldbuilding that should have a lot more impact and/or repercussions than it does. Could have been skipped.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VISSER</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/28/visser/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/28/visser/</guid><description>&lt;p>Told from the point of view of Visser One (former and, for the moment, current). On trial, in front of the Council of Thirteen themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I spoke to the holographic representation of the Council. Thirteen Yeerks in various host bodies: Nine Hork-Bajir, two Taxxons, and two whose host bodies were so concealed that I could not guess at their form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They were dressed in dark red robes, so dark that they were almost black. They stood, motionless, held in place, suspended by gravity-neutral fields, fed by a continuous refined current of Kandrona rays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Hork-Bajir-Controllers wore a lightweight mesh beneath their robes to keep the wrist and arm blades from slicing through the robe&amp;rsquo;s fabric.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The two Taxxon-Controllers were bloated, monstrously inflated versions of the great centipedes. Both were attended by Gedds, ready with freshly killed meat to feed the eternal hunger that not even a Yeerk inside that feverish brain can control. Their ceremonial robes were as large as sails, wrapped around the raised front third of their bodies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They were light-years away, of course. They would see me, my host face and body in three dimensions. They could also watch my vital signs, translated into universal equivalents. Blood pressure, heart rate, hormone production, all reduced to digital readouts a billion miles away. And they could, with a thought, call up whatever data had been compiled on specific events or locations or individuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I really do enjoy the worldbuilding here and I&amp;rsquo;m a bit sad that this is about as much as we&amp;rsquo;re going to get about the Council.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, it&amp;rsquo;s yet another interesting point of view. Especially when you add in Visser One&amp;rsquo;s testimony&amp;ndash;the backstory of how the Yeerk invasion of Earth actually began.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Tentatively I reached toward the far side of the brain. I touched it. Made contact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fascinating!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was incredible. This second half of the brain was an almost mirror image, but not. It could have functioned all on its own, if necessary, and yet it was in some ways radically different in its memories, its sensory interpretation, even its will. Two almost entirely functional brains in one skull, communicating across a channel of nerves. Not a fully redundant system, almost a second, different brain!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s more interesting to think that humans are weird like that (and that is weird) or that seemingly no other species is!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoy all of the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/animorphs-chronicles/">Animorphs Chronicles&lt;/a>. This is no exception.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Prophecy</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/27/the-prophecy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/27/the-prophecy/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;An Arn, on Earth? Here? Why? That&amp;rsquo;s the question. What&amp;rsquo;s he up to?&amp;gt; Rachel wondered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;He had to come. Star Wars: The Phantom Menace isn&amp;rsquo;t coming out on DVD there for, like, two years. He buys up a bunch of copies here, takes &amp;rsquo;em home, makes a fortune.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Good grief, Marco, you live science fiction, why do you want to watch science fiction?&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be dissing TPM,&amp;gt; Marco said. &lt;Cool is cool.>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; the Arn. Like I said &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/10/the-hork-bajir-chronicles/">The Hork-Bajir Chronicles&lt;/a> was among my favorites of these books, so following up on that storyline is pretty cool. Especially the the Animorphs getting a chance to go offworld entirely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And hey, let&amp;rsquo;s bring back the memory implant of Aldrea (the Andalite from the Hork-Bajir Chronicles, Seerow&amp;rsquo;s daughter) for good measure. Of course bringing back the dead to the source of some of their worst possible memories (although best too I suppose) can&amp;rsquo;t possibly go wrong&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat book. Bit weird, but I liked it. I hope something comes of it, but if it does, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember from last time I read these books. We shall have to see!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Proposal</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/27/the-proposal/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/27/the-proposal/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My name is Marco.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But you can call me &amp;ldquo;Marco the Mighty.&amp;rdquo; Or &amp;ldquo;Most Exalted Destroyer of My Pride.&amp;rdquo; You can cower before my mighty thumbs and beg for mercy, but you&amp;rsquo;ll be crushed just the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For I am the lord of the PlayStation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pick a game. Any game. Tekken. Duke Nukem. NFL Blitz. Whatever. Practice all you want. I&amp;rsquo;ll still beat you. I&amp;rsquo;ll crush you like Doc Martens crush ants.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A bit dated, but not terribly so. I do like Marco&amp;rsquo;s points of view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, then things go wrong (otherwise there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be much of a book, now would there?):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My arms! They weren&amp;rsquo;t becoming wings! What was happening? I felt them stretching out in front of me. The skin on my hands turning brittle, like armor. Fingers merging, becoming two barbed claws.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something was wrong!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My face . . .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A pinprick on each cheek! Two long whisker-like hairs sprouted outward. Instinctively, I swept them in front of me, gauging the wind, the temperature, sensing my surroundings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Antennae? Birds don&amp;rsquo;t have antennae!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dim eyes. Pincers. Antennae.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lobster?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was half-osprey, half-lobster?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A useless combination of mismatched parts.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a standard &amp;lsquo;discover a high powered Yeerk that&amp;rsquo;s going to ruin everyone&amp;rsquo;s day, so let&amp;rsquo;s take him down&amp;rsquo; sort of plot. This time with more TV personalities. And a secondary plot of Macro&amp;rsquo;s dad moving on, which&amp;ndash;given the storyline of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/25/the-conspiracy/">The Conspiracy&lt;/a> and the upcoming &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/28/visser/">VISSER&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;is complicated at best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Ooookay,&amp;gt; Jake replied. &amp;lt;That could have gone better. Guess it&amp;rsquo;s time for Plan B.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Someday when this is all over people will ask us about the war against the Yeerks,&amp;gt; Tobias said. &amp;lt;Let&amp;rsquo;s leave this part out&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Another good one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially with&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Marco, if you&amp;rsquo;re there, pick up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mother.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be continued in . . . &lt;em>Visser&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>The Illusion</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/26/the-illusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/26/the-illusion/</guid><description>&lt;p>Tobias just doesn&amp;rsquo;t get a break. (I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m saying that a lot recently).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, the Yeerks are working on an anti-morphing ray. And the Animorphs &lt;em>really&lt;/em> don&amp;rsquo;t want them to think &lt;em>that&lt;/em> works (despite the fact that&amp;hellip; they would really want to try it more than once. Or, despite the danger&amp;hellip; on Visser Three).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there&amp;rsquo;s an obvious answer. Who&amp;rsquo;s morph could they shine just about anything on and never get them to &amp;lsquo;de&amp;rsquo;morph?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tobias.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s actually kind of brilliant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Makes up a bit for the tone of the rest of the book. Man there are evil even by Yeerk standards in this book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Separation</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/26/the-separation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/26/the-separation/</guid><description>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a really strange story. And hard to talk about without spoiling the main conceit, which they at least seem to want to keep semi-hidden.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Conspiracy</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/25/the-conspiracy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/25/the-conspiracy/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an odd one to pair with &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/24/the-reunion/">The Reunion&lt;/a>. In both cases, we have an Animorph with a family member controller. In both cases, it&amp;rsquo;s too close to home. But Marco made the call&amp;ndash;even if it&amp;rsquo;s going to tear him up later to do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now it&amp;rsquo;s Jake&amp;rsquo;s turn.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You know what Marco and I used to talk about? Whether Batman could beat Spiderman. Whether Sega was better than Nintendo. Whether some girl would rather go out with him or me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now . . .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What are we, anymore, Marco? What has happened to us?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He didn&amp;rsquo;t answer. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect him to. We both knew what had happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Man these books get dark.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s one reason I like them. They don&amp;rsquo;t get into everything, but they really do get into enough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Reunion</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/24/the-reunion/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/24/the-reunion/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Interesting,&amp;gt; Ax observed. &amp;lt;Bearded, white-coated creatures with hooves. And horns. Grazers. I would point out the similarities between the mountain goat and Andalites, except for my extremely disappointing experience with the cow.&amp;gt; (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/17/the-experiment/">The Experiment&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so Marco&amp;rsquo;s mom is back&amp;ndash;and after the mess of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/04/the-decision/">The Decision&lt;/a>, she&amp;rsquo;s not Visser One anymore. But if anything, that means that she hates Visser Three all the more&amp;hellip; and would stop at nothing to get back at him. Even if that means allying herself with the &amp;lsquo;Andalite Bandits&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marco of course deals with this in a perfectly reasonable and level headed manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What do you do when you have to make a decision, and each choice is horrible? What would you do, Rachel? If it was your mom or dad or sisters. What would you do, Xena?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rachel came back and sat beside me on the bed. She didn&amp;rsquo;t hug me. Rachel&amp;rsquo;s not a hugger. But she sat there with me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;One battle at a time, Marco. One battle at a time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an intense book and man I feel for Marco. Tobias and Ax are really going through some stuff, but they&amp;rsquo;re only sort of human any more. Of the remaining Animorphs&amp;ndash;well, I think that it&amp;rsquo;s Marco that&amp;rsquo;s gone through the most. And this book certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t go easy on him.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The First Journey</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/23/the-first-journey/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/23/the-first-journey/</guid><description>&lt;p>Huh, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know they made these!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Animorphs, but choose your own adventure style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neat idea, subpar execution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each of the &amp;lsquo;choices&amp;rsquo; has only one correct answer. There are no branches and every dead end sees you killed and reset. And even with that, it&amp;rsquo;s barely 3/4 the length of most of the Animorph books&amp;ndash;already short.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; meh? There are only two. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if I read the other.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Elfangor's Secret</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/22/elfangors-secret/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/22/elfangors-secret/</guid><description>Am I some kind of hideous freak of nature, a twisted concoction of mismatched parts? Or am I something new and wonderful?
Depends on the day. Depends on whether I&amp;rsquo;m with Melissa, wanting to make her happy, wanting her to hold my hand, &amp;hellip;
Way to bury the lede there.
So&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s another time travel story. Another Time Matrix story. Another Ellimist / Cyarak story.
The slightly more interesting bit this time is that time is wrong.</description></item><item><title>The Sickness</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/21/the-sickness/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/21/the-sickness/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You ever notice how many different ways there are to say &amp;rsquo;throwing up&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo; Marco asked as we passed Dunkin&amp;rsquo; Donuts, the first in the row of fast food places dotting the main street running through town. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s vomiting, of course. Hurling. Tossing your cookies. Puking, a classic. Ralphing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was glad Marco was filling up the silence. Even though I thought he could have come up with a better topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s cascading. But I prefer the terms that are more real. Like blowing chunks. Spewing your guts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marco took a deep breath and kept on talking as we made our way past Taco Bell. &amp;ldquo;Tangoing with the toilet. That&amp;rsquo;s a good one,&amp;rdquo; he said reflectively. &amp;ldquo;Technicolor yawn.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The one where everyone gets sick (Ax deathly so) and Cassie has to go on a solo rescue mission to the Yeerk pool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quite a story and quite a bit more Cassie than we often get. Being the action hero no less!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A solid one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Experiment</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/17/the-experiment/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/17/the-experiment/</guid><description>&lt;p>The one where Ax watches entirely too much TV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Look, Tobias! Victor and Nikki are doing that thing again!&amp;gt; I pointed at the screen. &lt;They do this very often.>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Uh-huh.&amp;gt; His hawk eyes were trained on the little screen as Victor tightened his arms around Nikki. &amp;lt;It&amp;rsquo;s called kissing, Ax-man. Just like yesterday. And the day before. Kissing. Everyone does it. Of course, you need lips.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;I know what it is called. And the role of lips is self-evident. I simply do not know why it is performed.>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Ah. Well . . .&amp;gt; Tobias rearranged his wings noisily. &amp;lt;It&amp;rsquo;s definitely got a purpose. By the way, Marco&amp;rsquo;s heading this way.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Way too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Marco sighed. &amp;ldquo;Whatever you call it, it basically reeks, you know. I think it&amp;rsquo;s time I introduced you to some better programming, Ax. Buffy. Party of Five, maybe. Cops. South Park. Something, anything better than this. Although she is hot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Yes, she is hot. This is why she often wears less artificial skin.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yeah, well, I think you may have your cause and effect turned around there. Hey, you know what you need? A TV Guide.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Entirely&lt;/em> too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Nothing but lame sitcom reruns this week,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re not missing anything.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;There are always These Messages,&amp;gt; I pointed out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;These what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;The shorter shows that are displayed between longer shows. These Messages. They are often my favorites. &amp;ldquo;Zestfully clean! Zestfully clean! You&amp;rsquo;re not fully clean unless you&amp;rsquo;re Zestfully clean!&amp;rdquo; So much information condensed into so brief a format. So much emotional intensity.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re starting to scare me, Ax.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Yes. The entire book is like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, there&amp;rsquo;s also something about a machine to remove free will, which seems to fall into the &amp;lsquo;duh, that&amp;rsquo;s not possible category&amp;rsquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I wanted to tell him. I wanted to say, Look, it can&amp;rsquo;t be done. You don&amp;rsquo;t understand! There&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as a human being without a free will. It&amp;rsquo;s . . . it&amp;rsquo;s . . . idiotic! But he&amp;rsquo;s no scientist, much less a philosopher. You can&amp;rsquo;t separate a sentient creature from free will. They are free will. Yeerk, Hork-Bajir, human, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. A sentient species has free will like an object has mass. You can&amp;rsquo;t separate them! But Visser Three doesn&amp;rsquo;t listen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Which&amp;hellip; annoyed me more than it probably should have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t know what free will is. But you &lt;em>very much&lt;/em> can seemingly take away people&amp;rsquo;s free will. That&amp;rsquo;s what whole classes of drugs are designed to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Exposed</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/16/the-exposed/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/16/the-exposed/</guid><description>&lt;p>Erek&amp;rsquo;s glitching.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which&amp;ndash;if the Yeerks find out there have been highly advanced androids infiltrating them for years&amp;ndash;could be bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;How about his face? A mask?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jake ran to snatch up some full-head masks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I have Clinton, Gingrich, and a Teletubby. Dipsy, I think.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not Dipsy,&amp;rdquo; Cassie corrected. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s Tinky Winky. Dipsy&amp;rsquo;s green and has the straight up thing. Tinky Winky&amp;rsquo;s the one with the triangle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Who&amp;rsquo;s the little red one?&amp;gt; Marco wondered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Po,&amp;rdquo; Cassie said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Oh, yeah.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No offense,&amp;rdquo; Erek said, &amp;ldquo;but how on Earth have you people managed to avoid getting caught for this long?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I mean, he has a point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now the Animorphs have to go somewhere they&amp;rsquo;ve never gone before&amp;ndash;deep, &lt;em>deep&lt;/em> in the ocean. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/05/the-message/">The Message&lt;/a> was nothing compared to this. They&amp;rsquo;re going to need all new morphs this time around.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Calamari,&amp;rdquo; she said with a grin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Snails?&amp;rdquo; I said, frowning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;I am not in favor of snails,&amp;gt; Ax said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Wait, that&amp;rsquo;s not-&amp;rdquo; Cassie said loudly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;I had the misfortune to inadvertently eat one while feeding,&amp;gt; Ax continued. &lt;I did not see it in time. I stepped on it and digested it.>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You ate a snail through your hoof?&amp;rdquo; I asked. That picture temporarily replaced the image of me being squashed to the size of a Barbie doll on the ocean floor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Yes, and the meat portion was fine. However, once the snail&amp;rsquo;s body had been digested, the shell was very difficult to-&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Ooookay, I think that&amp;rsquo;s probably enough about snails,&amp;rdquo; Jake said.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>(Calamari isn&amp;rsquo;t snail anyways, as Cassie yells shortly after this section).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting premise and some really weird and wonderful (ymmv) new morphs and a fun (pun intended) look into Pemalite technology and culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Attack</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/14/the-attack/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/14/the-attack/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whelp, it seems &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/13/the-extreme/">The Extreme&lt;/a> wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>extreme&lt;/em> enough. Forget the Arctic, now the Animorphs are going to a world far, &lt;em>far&lt;/em> away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a(nother) precursor to The Ellimist Chronicles, detailing that long, &lt;em>long&lt;/em> battle between the Ellimist and Crayak.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t to be that simple. Approximately a hundred million Earth years ago, we became aware of a new force in the galaxy. Not a species, an individual. He was a fugitive from another galaxy, chased out of that galaxy by a power even greater than he. Greater than me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;We knew then, Crayak and I, that we could never make war again. Not open war, at least. The conflict would have to be carried on by different means. No longer a savage battle. Now it must be a chess game. There would be rules. Limits.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This time around, it&amp;rsquo;s a contest of champions: the Animorphs (plus Erek the Chee) versus Howlers (they killed the Chee&amp;rsquo;s creators, thus Erek).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>quite&lt;/em> the weird world. And quite the battle(s). And of course&amp;hellip; quite the solution out of left field. Turns out even strengths can be turned into a weakness if you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;hellip; human enough?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An interesting story, if a little weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Extreme</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/13/the-extreme/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/13/the-extreme/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hurled sixty million years into the past, and been trapped on alien planets, but I&amp;rsquo;d never felt so far from home.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The Animorphs go to the Arctic&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Yeerks have decided enough is enough. They&amp;rsquo;re sick of those &amp;lsquo;Andalite bandits&amp;rsquo; always ruining everything, so for their new secret project&amp;hellip; they&amp;rsquo;re going to build at the North Pole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Took long enough&amp;hellip; Even if they don&amp;rsquo;t think they&amp;rsquo;re humans, the Yeerks have the numbers. Spread out and there&amp;rsquo;s no way that a half dozen guerilla fighters could deal with you any more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s quite the adventure&amp;ndash;and establishes that the Animorphs have a way to handle extended away missions now:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Erek&amp;rsquo;s solution had been to have himself and three of his Chee friends program their holograms to look like each of us. Little did my dad know that he&amp;rsquo;d be sharing his cornflakes with an android who&amp;rsquo;d been on Earth since before the first flake was created.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;hellip; works. And gives a bit more flexibility in what stories they can tell. Man. They&amp;rsquo;re children. And having to deal with even this now&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A solid story&amp;ndash;and more evidence&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: This is the first &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/jeffrey-zeuhlke/">ghostwritten&lt;/a> Animorphs book. I&amp;rsquo;ll be putting the ghostwriters in the author section as well. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting practice. Not sure what to think about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Suspicion</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/12/the-suspicion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/12/the-suspicion/</guid><description>&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; the one with the Helmacrons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;re small. And very angry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of weird just how many aliens there are/have been wondering about the Earth. And this is no exception.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus, the idea of tiny aliens is (for the most part) played for laughs, rather than really digging into how in &lt;em>the world&lt;/em> that would work. How does anything work at that scale?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not one of my favorites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Pretender</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/11/the-pretender/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/11/the-pretender/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so after &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/08/the-solution/">the David Trilogy&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/10/the-hork-bajir-chronicles/">The Hork-Bajir Chronicles&lt;/a>, we were about due for something lighter, yes?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How about&amp;hellip; Tobias getting a letter from a long lost relative (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/23/the-andalite-chronicles/">hmm&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course it all goes well.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;How long do we have till your birthday, Tobias?&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Um . . . three days?&amp;gt; I asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Today&amp;rsquo;s the twenty-third. When&amp;rsquo;s your birthday?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;The twenty-fifth. I think. Twenty-sixth?&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marco laughed, then I guess he realized I wasn&amp;rsquo;t kidding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;I don&amp;rsquo;t . . . I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly remember. Not for sure. But I think it&amp;rsquo;s in three days.&amp;gt; I forced a laugh. &amp;lt;Just don&amp;rsquo;t ask me how old I am in bird years.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I really like Tobias. He&amp;rsquo;s quite often my favorite Animorph (Marco is a good one too). He&amp;rsquo;s just got such a &lt;em>fascinating&lt;/em> story and does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> give up. No matter how absolutely &lt;em>terrible&lt;/em> of a life hand he&amp;rsquo;s been dealt. And perhaps&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>For a long while neither of us spoke. Then Rachel, in a whisper, said, &amp;ldquo;What am I supposed to do, Tobias? I&amp;rsquo;m a girl. You&amp;rsquo;re a bird. This is way past Romeo and Juliet, Montagues and Capulets. This isn&amp;rsquo;t Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio coming from different social groups or whatever. It&amp;rsquo;s not like you&amp;rsquo;re black and I&amp;rsquo;m white like Cassie and Jake. No one but a moron cares about that. We are . . . we can&amp;rsquo;t hold hands, Tobias. We can&amp;rsquo;t dance. We can&amp;rsquo;t go to a movie together.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Even find love? (I enjoy their growing relationship.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What it all comes down to?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It suddenly occurred to me, right then, for the first time, that what I thought was so unique about me - that I was half instinctive predator, and half human being - wasn&amp;rsquo;t so unique after all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every human - Jake. Rachel. Marco. Cassie, all humans - kind of lives on that edge between savage and saint. And the thing is that sometimes when you get pushed you do have to push back. And other times, you have to turn the other cheek.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A solid story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hork-Bajir Chronicles</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/10/the-hork-bajir-chronicles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/10/the-hork-bajir-chronicles/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh, I do enjoy the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/animorphs-chronicles/">Animorphs Chronicles&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/23/the-andalite-chronicles/">The Andalite Chronicles&lt;/a> were good, but if anything, The Hork-Bajir Chronicles are even better! If nothing else, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot less time travel. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this one, we get not only the story of the Hork-Bajir, but to a large extent the story of how the Yeerks came to be as well:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Alloran turned all four of his eyes on my father. &amp;lt;Prince Seerow, you are relieved of duty.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;You can&amp;rsquo;t relieve me!&amp;gt; my father cried.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;When a commander has become incapacitated due to injury or mental defect, his subordinates may relieve him,&amp;gt; Alloran quoted from the regulations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;What mental defect?&amp;gt; my father demanded.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Stupidity,&amp;gt; Alloran said harshly. &amp;lt;The stupidity of kindness. Charity to potential enemies. You&amp;rsquo;re a fool, Seerow. A soft, sentimental, well-meaning fool. And now my men are dead and the Yeerks are loose in the galaxy. How many will die before we can bring this contagion under control? How many will die for Seerow&amp;rsquo;s kindness?&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s Alloran and his family (especially his daughter) sent to the Hork-Bajir world&amp;ndash;and them that end up directly participating in the terrible mess that we all knew had to be coming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But up until then, I love the worldbuilding in this one. The Hork-Bajir world is &lt;em>weird&lt;/em>. I love the idea of a shattered world and giant (kilometers tall) trees keeping it barely habitable. I love the (minor spoilers) reasons &lt;em>why&lt;/em> the world and the Hork-Bajir are the way they are.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then eventually, I love the conflict. Andalite versus Hork-Bajir, not fighting, but morally and ethically. And the Yeerks in all their soon to be overwhelming numbers. It&amp;rsquo;s an invasion rather unlike that of Earth&amp;ndash;far more out in the open.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an added bonus, our first point of view of how the Yeerks do their thing:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My sonar found the head quite easily, of course. And I&amp;rsquo;d been taught how to pinpoint the opening into the head by extending two palps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was quite a small entryway. I had to squeeze myself down and work my way slowly inside the ear canal. From there on, it was all by feel. My sonar didn&amp;rsquo;t work, of course. And the smells encountered were unfamiliar, useless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But then, after what seemed far too long a time, my palps encountered a surface alive with electricity!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The brain. I could feel the activity, the snapping neurons, the arcs of microvoltage between synapses. I had to flatten myself all the way. My palps sought for trenches, gaps, openings around the brain. And I found them. I pushed my body down inside each wrinkle of the brain. Just as I&amp;rsquo;d been taught to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And slowly at first, then faster and faster, I began to make contact! I felt the neurons connecting to me!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Still&amp;hellip; a bit weird. But it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see for once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I mentioned, one of my favorites, at least up until we get to The Ellimist Chronicles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Solution</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/08/the-solution/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/08/the-solution/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so The Solution to the David Trilogy (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/08/the-discovery/">The Discovery&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/08/the-threat/">The Threat&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes there &lt;em>are&lt;/em> no good solutions. This becomes increasingly clear as the series goes on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But oh, this one. This is one of the hardest to justify.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It do not like this storyline. It&amp;rsquo;s well written and I think needed to be told. Still don&amp;rsquo;t like it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Threat</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/08/the-threat/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/08/the-threat/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Aww, shut up, Marco,&amp;gt; Rachel said good-naturedly. &amp;lt;It&amp;rsquo;s kind of fun. The wind whistling through the chinks in my body armor, rustling the spikes on my legs . . .&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;You people are all crazy,&amp;gt; David said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;At one level, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of fascinating, you know?&amp;gt; Cassie said. &amp;lt;I mean, did anyone ever read the Miss Spider books? Miss Spider&amp;rsquo;s Tea Party, Miss Spider&amp;rsquo;s New Car? This could be Miss Spider Goes Flying.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;You people are &lt;em>all&lt;/em> crazy,&amp;gt; David repeated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Dragonfly Airlines,&amp;gt; Rachel said with a laugh.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so continues the David saga (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/08/the-discovery/">The Discovery&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/08/the-solution/">The Solution&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this one, the new Animorph is put &lt;em>entirely&lt;/em> under the test. A meeting of world leaders. One (at least) is already a Controller&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting seeing David fit in&amp;ndash;and even more so when he doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Discovery</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/08/the-discovery/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/08/the-discovery/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so David&amp;ndash;oy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently the morphing cube (I&amp;rsquo;m sure it has a better name) survived. That seems&amp;hellip; impressive, but it does work well enough as a plot device.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And this kid (the aforementioned David) found it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing leads to another and in the end, there&amp;rsquo;s no choice. They need to make a new Animorph. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be the first time, they added Ax after all. And Tobias has a bit of the same feel. But man. It&amp;rsquo;s quite the thing to be doing now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course everything goes well&amp;ndash;well enough for a 3 part story anyways, with &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/08/the-threat/">The Threat&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/08/the-solution/">The Solution&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do not like this plotline. David feels less well developed than the rest of the Animorphs (for good reason to be fair) and it&amp;rsquo;s a mess from the beginning. It&amp;rsquo;s more of the &amp;rsquo;this is a terrible situation&amp;rsquo; that the Animorphs really start digging into as we go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Departure</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/07/the-departure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/07/the-departure/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Andalites, humans, there’s no difference. You’re both smug, moralizing, ”superior” races. You both live in beautiful worlds. You have hands and eyes, and the freedom to move about wherever you like. And you hate us for wanting all those same things.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Cassie is done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Frankly, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of amazing she lasted as long as she did. At her heart, Cassie is a healer&amp;hellip; and now she&amp;rsquo;s spent months (years? who knows) in a war. Literally taking lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So she&amp;rsquo;s done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course that&amp;rsquo;s when things go sidewise in all the best story appropriate ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating look into the stress that all of the Animorphs are under, but what&amp;rsquo;s more&amp;hellip; a surprising look into Yeerks &lt;em>that could be more&lt;/em>. They &lt;em>aren&amp;rsquo;t all evil&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s what makes the story all the better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed this one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>In the Time of Dinosaurs</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/06/in-the-time-of-dinosaurs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/06/in-the-time-of-dinosaurs/</guid><description>&lt;p>I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s right there in the title right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Animorphs try to do the right thing and instead get blown back 65 million years in the past. They almost get eaten, find a bunch of aliens no one has ever heard of (and we&amp;rsquo;ll never see again I expect), almost get eaten, go steal a nuke, almost get eaten, and eventually get home. Because what sort of series would this be if they didn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think that the Animorphs might have a time travel problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although, I guess it&amp;rsquo;s been longer than than I thought since last time (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/11/the-stranger/">The Stranger&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/21/the-forgotten/">The Forgotten&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/23/the-andalite-chronicles/">The Andalite Chronicles&lt;/a>; alternatively, it was last 65 million years from now!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s certainly an exciting story. And we get a touch of the moral issues involved in potentially changing the timeline&amp;ndash;or having to allow something terrible to happen to preserve it. Along with some much more interesting aliens than we often see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So a good story. Worthy of the heftier Megamorphs page count I think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward and back&amp;hellip; TO THE FUTURE!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Decision</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/04/the-decision/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/04/the-decision/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I know it seems impossible even to conceive of Andalites as traitors. I know the very idea makes any decent Andalite sick inside. But I am telling the truth. The Ascalin incident happened. We were betrayed by one of our own.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Quite the introduction, that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another high level person threatened with a Yeerkening. A mad plan to get in and turn it to their advantage&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then suddenly &lt;em>yoink&lt;/em>. You&amp;rsquo;re in a war on another planet, a billion miles away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out even vanishingly unlikely things can happen if you&amp;rsquo;re the protagonists of a book!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat book. Shades our relationships with the Andelites a bit more, gives Ax some hard choices to make, and perhaps&amp;ndash;just perhaps&amp;ndash;gets a good word about what&amp;rsquo;s going on on Earth to someone that may be able to help.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Underground</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/02/the-underground/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/02/the-underground/</guid><description>&lt;p>A secret weapon against the Yeerks?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Cassie suddenly laughed. It was a cynical laugh. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know she was capable of a cynical laugh. &amp;ldquo;And all the rights and wrongs, and all the lines between good and evil, just go wafting and waving and swirling around, don&amp;rsquo;t they?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Yeah. Of course things couldn&amp;rsquo;t be that easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s another in the series continuing to dig into just how terrible some of the things these kids (and don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong&amp;ndash;they are &lt;em>so&lt;/em> young for &lt;em>any&lt;/em> of this) find themselves doing. For the most part, they&amp;rsquo;ve survived unscathed. And they have a certain amount of plot immunity. But even that, you can&amp;rsquo;t expect to hold out forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s an intense book, somewhat offset (and at times I would even say weakened) by the constant ridiculousness of said &amp;lsquo;secret weapon&amp;rsquo;. One strange bit, so far as I remember&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s never mentioned again. Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m just not remembering it, it has been a while, but it seems a weird thing to drop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But worth the (re-)read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Warning</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/31/the-warning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/31/the-warning/</guid><description>&lt;p>The one with the (mid-90s) Internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much of the technology in this book is weird and dated&amp;ndash;primarily since it comes on the tale end of the AOL-style internet, with chat rooms and email clients baked into your connection itself and before the more free-for-all (glorious) mess of the early 2000s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, bragging about 38400 baud modems. Talking about &amp;lsquo;code words&amp;rsquo; instead of passwords. Associating cookies with your &amp;lsquo;screen name&amp;rsquo;. A search result (even for a weird &amp;lsquo;made up&amp;rsquo; term) returning exactly &lt;em>one&lt;/em> hit. It&amp;rsquo;s such a weird mix of now dated technology of the time&amp;ndash;some done slightly wrong. And it&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also the one (of many) where they start to touch on the moral complexities of (teenagers fighting a) war.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It was the best you could do,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;It was all you could do. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s hard to fight evil without doing some along the way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We saw a bit of this in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/28/the-escape/">The Escape&lt;/a>, but it&amp;rsquo;s really coming home now:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I just want to get back to a life someday where I don&amp;rsquo;t have to make decisions that might get people killed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Do you?&amp;rdquo; Now Marco&amp;rsquo;s smile was definitely of the mocking variety. &amp;ldquo;You really think someday we can all go back to being regular kids? You think after being the leader of the Animorphs you can go back to being Joe Average Student?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, I do.&amp;rdquo; I said it forcefully. I meant it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And&amp;hellip; yeah.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s hard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it&amp;rsquo;s not going to get any easier over the remaining dozens of books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oy for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Escape</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/28/the-escape/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/28/the-escape/</guid><description>&lt;p>Marco books have some of the best snippets.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I jumped in, feet first, around the eight-foot marker. I bobbed back up to the surface and said, &amp;ldquo;This is insane, Marco.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To which I answered, &amp;ldquo;So I&amp;rsquo;ll be careful.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To which I countered, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re talking to yourself, do you know that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, shut up,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You know, sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s just a very fine line between us and the Three Stooges,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;What are stooges?&amp;gt; Ax asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A stooge is a guy stupid enough to run around inside a Yeerk stronghold wearing a pair of bike shorts and accompanied by a Deer-man from outer space and a mouse-eating Bird-boy. That&amp;rsquo;s a stooge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Also, SHARKS!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;re the Hork-Bajir of the sea! Apparently literally. It&amp;rsquo;s an odd one to pair right fater &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/25/the-unknown/">The Unknown&lt;/a>. Back to back books talking about non-human/animal Controllers, although with rather different outcomes. And now I want to look up the differences between shark and horse brains&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus, we get an appearance by a new, interesting race (mind reading amphibians!), more Visser One scenes (of course, it&amp;rsquo;s a Marco points of view)/Visser Three politics, and some underwater adventures, which are neat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a decent entry. Up from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/24/the-change/">The Change&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/25/the-unknown/">The Unknown&lt;/a>, I think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Change</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/24/the-change/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/24/the-change/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“And what do you want, Tobias?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>”You know what I want,” I said, almost choking on the words. ”You know.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>”Yes. But do YOU know what you want, Tobias?”, the Ellimist asked. ”And if you get it, will you still know?”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Yes. Spoilers. The Ellimist is around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And since this originally released the same day as &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/23/the-andalite-chronicles/">The Andalite Chronicles&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;and because it&amp;rsquo;s a Tobias book, you had to expect it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short, the Ellimist is (totally not 😉) interfering to free some Hork-Bajir. Tobias gets roped in. We do learn a lot more about Hork-Bajir (more than we will really until somewhat later in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/10/the-hork-bajir-chronicles/">The Hork-Bajir Chronicles&lt;/a>). It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing to be doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yet, I still totally get Tobias lamenting getting jerked around like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But in the end&amp;ndash;it was all worth it?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Andalite Chronicles</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/23/the-andalite-chronicles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/23/the-andalite-chronicles/</guid><description>&lt;p>Something new! (If you not on a reread :))&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rather than the shared points of view of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/12/the-andalites-gift/">The Andalite&amp;#39;s Gift&lt;/a>, we now have the first [[Animorphs Chronicles|chronicle]] book: a book written from a completely alien (heh) point of view to fill in some other part of the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this case Elfangor-Sirinial-Shamtul. The one who in a lot of ways started this whole mess. And after reading this book&amp;ndash;apparently in more ways than we could believe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the plus side, we get a lot of fascinating world building. Learning more about Andelite culture directly, as opposed to via our normal human filters. Learning about Yeerks. Visser Three (before he was Three!). And Taxxons. And Skrit Na.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Skrit Na ship was round, with tapered sides. It looked like a fat disc. You could hardly even see where the engines were, and the Skrit Na had blinking colored lights all around it. I guess they find that attractive or something.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>(it&amp;rsquo;s a typical saucer shaped UFO)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand (minor spoilers, but it becomes obvious fairly early), time travel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve done that already&amp;ndash;and not that long ago (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/21/the-forgotten/">The Forgotten&lt;/a>). And&amp;hellip; while it&amp;rsquo;s got some interesting points here, it makes things a bit too messy and convenient, at least in my opinion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Reaction</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/22/the-reaction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/22/the-reaction/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of amazing how many different one off plot lines this series introduces and just never (so far as I remember) deals with again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around&amp;hellip; being (somehow) allergic to newly acquired DNA!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat idea and does enough to support the story by itself&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So of course we have to deal with some random made up teenage heartthrob storyline.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I ignored Marco. I almost always do. Instead I made sure Jake was paying attention, and I said, &amp;ldquo;Jake, you&amp;rsquo;re not getting it. About half the girls in our school have a poster of Jeremy Jason McCole in their bedrooms or in their lockers, or both. He is the number one cute guy in the country. He has like twenty Web sites just about him. If he endorses The Sharing, it would be as if . . .&amp;rdquo; I looked to Cassie for help.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; weird. I get it. They&amp;rsquo;re teenagers. But it&amp;rsquo;s still not something I really understood even then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such is life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Forgotten</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/21/the-forgotten/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/21/the-forgotten/</guid><description>&lt;p>FLASH.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The one with a big ball of wibbly wobbly&amp;hellip; time-y wimey&amp;hellip; stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s weird tension (did he finally go crazy?) and a neat resolution (possibly, but at least this time around he&amp;rsquo;s not) that theoretically raises some big interesting world building problems&amp;ndash;that we probably won&amp;rsquo;t ever have to deal with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a good one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Android</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/18/the-android/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/18/the-android/</guid><description>&lt;p>The one where Marco gets a haircut.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we discover yet another random alien species that&amp;rsquo;s been living among us all along.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting book, digging (if less than it could) into ideas like radical pacifism, free will, and the domestication of modern dogs. All with the trademark Marco snark as the point of view.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;English paper?&amp;rdquo; Jake asked as he sat down across from me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yeah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He laughed. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re good for me, Marco. Compared to you, I&amp;rsquo;m so responsible. You have a topic?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I looked up at him and thumped my finger down on the paper. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve already written three pages. What do you mean, do I have a topic?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But Jake knows me. &amp;ldquo;So,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Do you have a topic?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A topic will . . . emerge. I&amp;rsquo;m going to just write until I discover a topic. The topic will rise from these pages. It will reveal itself to me. I just have to keep writing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He nodded and made a face at the Goo of the Day on his tray. &amp;ldquo;This food is blue. Food should not be blue. Hey, here&amp;rsquo;s a topic for you - the use of total bull in the writing of English papers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I grinned. &amp;ldquo;I am the master of bull. Three pages so far and I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually said a single thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t particular remember if/when we see the Chee (spoilers!) again, but if we do, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot left on the floor here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of my favorites so far.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Secret</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/17/the-secret/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/17/the-secret/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s amusing just how much trouble the Animorphs (six kids, remember) cause the Yeerks on Earth (and Visser Three in particular).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much so that they&amp;rsquo;re willing to come up with convoluted schemes to get approval to log an entire forest where they suspect those &amp;lsquo;Andelite bandits&amp;rsquo; are hiding. (Which, to be fair, they&amp;rsquo;re not entirely wrong about).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So of course, Cassie gets the point of view and we have to SAVE THE SKUNKS! (it makes more sense than you might think).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A solid entry.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Alien</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/the-alien/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/the-alien/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need.&amp;rdquo; A famous human named Rolling Stones said that. I thought it was very wise, for a human.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>From the Earth Diary of Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Our first point of view of Ax. Who&amp;rsquo;s an alien (oh so alien).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Here, just take the box,&amp;rdquo; Marco said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He handed me the box of popcorn. I quickly ate the rest of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Not the box,&amp;rdquo; Marco wailed. &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t eat the box!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It tasted of salt and grease,&amp;rdquo; I pointed out.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun look at cultural differences. I generally think that the series badly overdoes how he&amp;rsquo;s constantly reacting to things like speaking/eating/standing on two legs, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun to see it from his point of view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Culturally, we do get a decent bit of interesting story building here. What makes humans interesting in this universe. What Andelite culture is built on. What families are like. Etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m glad that the core conflict doesn&amp;rsquo;t (for the most part) get drug beyond one book. That would get tiring.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Andalite's Gift</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/12/the-andalites-gift/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/12/the-andalites-gift/</guid><description>&lt;p>The first &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/megamorphs/">Megamorphs&lt;/a> book&amp;ndash;with the point of view switching each chapter rather than per book&amp;ndash;and almost twice as long! (apparently it was originally published as two books?) It&amp;rsquo;s a neat concept and a good way to shake up the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than that, it&amp;rsquo;s summer time. The Animorphs are coming off a &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/11/the-stranger/">big win&lt;/a>. So it&amp;rsquo;s time to relax.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until a living tornado from Saturn comes to visit&amp;ndash;seemingly focussed on finding and shredding our friendly neighborhood Animorphs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, an amnesia plot. Which morphing for some reason didn&amp;rsquo;t heal?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; fine? The other &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/megamorphs/">Megamorphs&lt;/a> books are better.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Stranger</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/11/the-stranger/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/11/the-stranger/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Hi, Josep,&amp;gt; I said, using thought-speak.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What the . . . Who? Who said that? I&amp;rsquo;m hearing voices!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Me,&amp;gt; I replied. &amp;lt;I said it. See, Josep, I am from the International Elephant Police. We have had some complaints about you.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This is crazy! This is crazy! What are you? Is this some sort of a joke?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; remember that big weird biomechanical appearance at the end of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/09/the-capture/">The Capture&lt;/a>?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I am an Ellimist,&amp;rdquo; he said, speaking with an actual voice, &amp;ldquo;as your Andalite friend guessed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ax was shaking so badly he looked like he might fall down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Be at peace, Andalite,&amp;rdquo; the Ellimist said. &amp;ldquo;Look at your human friends. They do not fear me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;They don&amp;rsquo;t know what you are,&amp;gt; Ax managed to say.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ellimist smiled. &amp;ldquo;Neither do you. All you know are the fairy stories your people tell to children.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I remember The Ellimist Chronicles being one of my favorite books of the series. I did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> remember that they showed up quite so early. An interesting bit of worldbuilding, if nearing on an almost &lt;em>literal&lt;/em> deus-ex-machina.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a good book, but it&amp;rsquo;s tonally weird compared to any of the books thus far&amp;ndash;quite a jump in scope/scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although I do like Rachel&amp;rsquo;s cover / new combat morph though. Not &lt;em>quite&lt;/em> as many size issues as she had with the elephant.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Capture</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/09/the-capture/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/09/the-capture/</guid><description>&lt;p>A look far deeper than anyone wanted into what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be a Yeerk/controller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And some actual &lt;em>plans&lt;/em> to take over some more high powered individuals than High School kids and Assistant Principals. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an intense book, only slightly weakened by a few &amp;lsquo;unlikely at best&amp;rsquo; moments that are needed to drive the plot forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a good one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Predator</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/08/the-predator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/08/the-predator/</guid><description>&lt;p>The one with Marco&amp;rsquo;s backstory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two years ago his mother died/disappeared at sea. In that time, his father has not really taken that well, leading to a somewhat rough home life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, Ax tries to call home. This also goes poorly, although probably not how you&amp;rsquo;d expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Capture! A trip to SPACE! Power struggles among the Yeerks! And&amp;hellip; a surprise visit from Visser One.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An interesting twist that. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any more sense than a random Assistant Principal being a high placed local Controller, but it works for the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Slightly weaker than &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/04/the-encounter/">The Encounter&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/05/the-message/">The Message&lt;/a>, but there&amp;rsquo;s potential for some interesting stories in the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Message</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/05/the-message/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/05/the-message/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;How about my dream of living long enough to get a driver&amp;rsquo;s license?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so we have upper bound on their current ages. They&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em>so&lt;/em> young&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On re-reading this, I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten how early Ax was introduced. It&amp;rsquo;s such a neat story. The young alien left behind. Another child, just like them. And then you have the ocean morphs&amp;ndash;dolphins!&amp;ndash;and talking(ish) whales.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot to like about this one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Encounter</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/04/the-encounter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/04/the-encounter/</guid><description>&lt;p>Tobias, this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He&amp;rsquo;s such a fascinating character. In the very first book he broke the number one rule of morphing&amp;ndash;if you stay in morph for more than two hours, you&amp;rsquo;re stuck like that. Forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now Tobias is a red-tailed hawk, with the mind of a boy (and also somewhat a hawk, because that&amp;rsquo;s how morphing works).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which is just such a fascinating way to do it. And leads to some really interesting digging into what it actually even means to be human&amp;hellip; and what it might mean to lose that little bit of yourself&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It worried me a little. It made me wonder. Was he right about other things as well?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How many risks could we take before we lost? How long till the five of us were four? Or two?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or none?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And now we have more than 50 books to find out!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Visitor</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/02/the-visitor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/02/the-visitor/</guid><description>&lt;p>The one where the big bad alien controlled Assistant Principal&amp;hellip; has a touch of humanity after all.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;He wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Controller,&amp;rdquo; I said scornfully. &amp;ldquo;Why would the Yeerks want to make a Controller out of a punk? They want people in positions of power.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t know that for sure,&amp;rdquo; Jake said. &amp;ldquo;Tom isn&amp;rsquo;t in a position of power.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A good question that. Or why Chapman for that matter&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;em>so very&lt;/em> weird what random people the Yeerks chose to take over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a decent story. Making some Yeerks all the more terrifying while at the same time humanizing others. Makes everything all the more complicated&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Invasion</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/01/the-invasion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/01/the-invasion/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so&amp;hellip; the Animorphs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve read the entire series a couple times, but it&amp;rsquo;s also been at &lt;em>least&lt;/em> a decade. I remember that they&amp;rsquo;re very light reads, at times a bit dated (which I expect hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten better), and&amp;hellip; surprisingly good! Let&amp;rsquo;s see if they hold up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We start with &lt;em>The Invasion&lt;/em>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>5 kids walking home from the mall (do kids ever go to malls any more?) and stumble upon an alien. Dying from his wounds, hunted by his enemies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And oh what enemies they are&amp;hellip; the Yeerks. Alien slugs that can slither into your ear and take you over. And for some reason, they&amp;rsquo;re taking over this unspecified (probably West Coast US, we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that) small city, starting with&amp;hellip; high schoolers and Assistant Principals?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Big battle ensues, one alien kills another, but just before, the kids are given the power to fight back&amp;ndash;by turning (morphing) into any animal they can touch (acquire).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initially, they&amp;rsquo;re (rightfully) not willing to fight back, but of course things go sideways.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m sure we could talk them into letting us in for nothing,&amp;rdquo; Marco said. &amp;ldquo;Just tell them we&amp;rsquo;re Animorphs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Tell them we&amp;rsquo;re what?&amp;rdquo; Rachel asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Idiot teenagers with a death wish,&amp;rdquo; Marco said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Animorphs.&amp;rdquo; I tried the word out. It sounded okay.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And… so it begins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed it. And I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to re-reading the series!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unknown</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/25/the-unknown/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/25/the-unknown/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>One way you can judge a person is by looking at their friends . . . and their enemies. I have wonderful friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And terrible enemies.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The one with Area ~51~ 91.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is such a silly book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the conspiracy theories are right (more or less)! So of course the Yeerks need a way in to learn the truth&amp;ndash;and the obvious answer isn&amp;rsquo;t to take over &lt;em>anyone&lt;/em> on the base. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s why they take over high school basketball players and assistant principals. They can&amp;rsquo;t get anyone higher placed&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, the Yeerks are going in, so of course the Animorphs have to as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whee!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
