&lt;p&gt;I did however, read the entire Bible this year (for the second time, first time with the additional Catholic books). This time around, guided by the excellent &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bible-in-a-year-with-fr-mike-schmitz/id1539568321" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Bible in a Year&lt;/a&gt; podcast hosted by Fr. Mike Schmitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the year, it goes through every single book in the Bible in a fairly well thought out order&amp;ndash;which certainly does make you realize just how much more of the Old Testament there is&amp;hellip; (For context, the OT is 3x as long as the NT.) Given that the host is a priest, there&amp;rsquo;s a definite Catholic slant to things, but the commentary and extra context that applies to it is absolutely fascinating. Catholic or Protestant, agnostic or atheist, I think it&amp;rsquo;s something worth investing a half hour a day into.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
