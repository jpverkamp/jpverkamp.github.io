The kids love them. This is basically a collection of the chapters from each book that cover Christmas. There’s a bit of context that feels like it’s missing without having just read the proceeding parts of the books, but if you’ve listened to them enough, it doesn’t overly matter.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At this point, we&amp;rsquo;ve listened to all of the full Little House books&amp;hellip; who knows how many times. But there&amp;rsquo;s always room for a shorter read when you just want to pick up a book for an afternoon read or in bed. And once the kids are reading on their own, I&amp;rsquo;m sure they&amp;rsquo;ll appreciate it all the more.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
