&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not actually sure what it is about the books. The writing is fine&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s overdone in a way that feels &amp;lsquo;Holmesy&amp;rsquo; with a Cthulhian creepiness throughout &amp;ndash;but I just can&amp;rsquo;t get it to stick. And then about halfway, suddenly we have a few chapters of a flashback from entirely another set of characters, which I actually enjoyed reading more. But that&amp;rsquo;s not the book I started to read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sherlock Holmes and the Shadwell Shadows</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/03/14/sherlock-holmes-and-the-shadwell-shadows/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 16:47:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/03/14/sherlock-holmes-and-the-shadwell-shadows/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You are far too stolid and unimaginative, Watson, to invent a tale like that.&lt;/p>

In a nutshell, Sherlock Holmes and The Call of Cthulhu are both in the public domain now, so author James Lovegrove essentially took them and mashed them into this unholy (yet at times awesome) abomination. In universe, these stories are told by Watson as &amp;lsquo;the real story&amp;rsquo;, where all of the rest of the Sherlock Holmes mythos was fiction made up to hide the darker, Cthulhuian truths. They found their way from Watson to Lovecraft&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
