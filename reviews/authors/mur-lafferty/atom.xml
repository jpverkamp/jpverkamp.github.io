With clones! What that gives us is an absolutely wonderful variation on the tropes. Because of cloning technology, you can very well have a murder mystery where the cast wake up to the gruesome (zero gee) murder of &amp;hellip; the entire cast. And because it&amp;rsquo;s a generation ship in deep space, you very well know that one of the cast absolutely has to have been the muderer&amp;hellip; Unless it was more than one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My favorite parts of the worldbuilding all really revolve around technology of cloning and how that can change the world in fascinating ways. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon for attendees at certain parties to end murdered. They&amp;rsquo;ll wake up in the morning, restored from a backup the day before with little more than a feeling of &amp;rsquo;that must have been one hell of a party&amp;rsquo; plus some potential embarrassment and go about their lives.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
