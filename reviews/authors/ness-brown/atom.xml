To get us out of it, we sent a generation ship to the stars. But when we got there&amp;hellip; it wasn&amp;rsquo;t any better, so they turned around to go home. On the way back&amp;hellip; well, we just might not be alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A generation ship is a great setting for a sci-fi/horror mashup. There really is nowhere to run but plenty of places to hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of things lurking out there between the stars? Terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feel of the book, especially as it ratchets up to the big reveal/fight scenes throughout the ship? Excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the only real problems I had with the book were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was too short! Novella length, but the premise alone could certainly fill a novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology was a bit odd at times (what exactly are they doing with &amp;lsquo;jumps&amp;rsquo;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;span class="spoiler"&gt;The things in the dark between stars not actually being the monster? Awesome. But... what were they then?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth a read though! A debut author worth following.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
