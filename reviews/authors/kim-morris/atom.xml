&lt;p>Sort of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things go well.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Rachel whirled around. Her face red with anger. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m through taking orders from you,&amp;rdquo; she said through clenched teeth. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m through with Marco and his stupid jokes. I&amp;rsquo;m through with Cassie&amp;rsquo;s hypocrisy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cassie took a broom from the corner and began to sweep up the glass. &amp;ldquo;Count me out, too,&amp;rdquo; she said softly. &amp;ldquo;If this war is unwinnable, how do we justify killing Hork-Bajir? Basically, they&amp;rsquo;re prisoners of war. Innocent victims.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marco thrusts his hands into his pockets. &amp;ldquo;Guess I&amp;rsquo;m out, too. I&amp;rsquo;m going to enjoy what time I&amp;rsquo;ve got left. Acquire a surfer dude chick magnet. Hang out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It would be nice to meet some fine upstanding examples of Andalite society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today&amp;hellip; is not that day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a solid story. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice contrast to Ax&amp;rsquo;s earlier conflict between his people&amp;hellip; and his people.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
