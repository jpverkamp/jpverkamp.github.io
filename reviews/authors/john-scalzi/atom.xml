&lt;p>Making people change because you can’t deal with who they are isn’t how it’s supposed to be done. What needs to be done is for people to pull their heads out of their asses. You say ‘cure.’ I hear ‘you’re not human enough.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Been a bit since I last read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/old-mans-war/">any Scalzi&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;m glad to get back around to it though. Lock In is very good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, Lock In takes place in a near future Earth where a flu-like pandemic (Haden&amp;rsquo;s Syndrome) has caused &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/locked-in%20syndrome">locked-in syndrome&lt;/a> in some small percent of the world&amp;rsquo;s population (a small percent of billions is still an awful lot of people). Those affected are completely paralyzed, unable to move, while still being fully aware and conscious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily(ish) a massive global effort has figured out how to embed computer hardware in their brains so as to allow them to remotely pilot either robotic bodies (threeps&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>) or (more rarely) other humans who&amp;rsquo;ve allowed them access&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This of course is widely accepted by the rest of humanity and causes no issues whatsoever.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It definitely has a different feel to it than the rest of the Old Man&amp;rsquo;s War books, matching the idea that it was written by a teenage girl (having never been one, I can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee the accuracy, but it worked for me).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Last Colony</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/09/26/the-last-colony/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/09/26/the-last-colony/</guid><description>&lt;p>After John&amp;rsquo;s story in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/old-mans-war/">Old Man’s War&lt;/a> and Jane&amp;rsquo;s (to some extent) in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/09/08/the-ghost-brigades/">The Ghost Brigades&lt;/a>, this time around we get both of them. They&amp;rsquo;re together now and raising Zoë (how&amp;rsquo;s that for a complicated family), when they&amp;rsquo;re tapped to head an entirely new colony planet Roanoke&amp;ndash;with the first city named Croatoan. Also&amp;hellip; why would they even agree to that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean&amp;hellip; come on. Either no one knows the history behind the names&amp;ndash;in which case why in the world would they be using them&amp;ndash;or they do&amp;ndash;in which case why in the world would you choose &lt;em>that&lt;/em> to name your new colony. Granted, they turn out to want it to be lost, but still. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit annoying.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Ghost Brigades</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/09/08/the-ghost-brigades/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/09/08/the-ghost-brigades/</guid><description>&lt;p>After I read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/old-mans-war/">Old Man’s War&lt;/a>, I went looking for the sequels. While on paper &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/09/08/the-ghost-brigades/">The Ghost Brigades&lt;/a> is the second in the series, it&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We get a lot more of a look into the CDF and specifically Special Forces, which was something that was interesting from the first book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Old Man's War</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/08/23/old-mans-war/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/08/23/old-mans-war/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I did two things on my seventy-fifth birthday. I visited my wife’s grave. Then I joined the army.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Fascinating.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
