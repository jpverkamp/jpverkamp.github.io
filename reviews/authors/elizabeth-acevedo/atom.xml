Spanish my first language&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>bachata a reminder of the power of my body
plÃ¡nto &amp;amp; salami for years before I ever tasted

peanut butter &amp;amp; jelly sandwhicches.
If you asked me what I was,

&amp;amp; you meant in terms of culture, 
I'd say Dominican.

No hesitation, 
no question about it. 

Can you be from a place
you have never been?

You can find the island stamped all over me,
but what would the island find if I was there?

Can you claim a home that does not know you,
much less claim you as its own?
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Clap when you land is a beautiful story about two girls from completely different worlds (New York and the Dominican Republic) and upbringings that, through tragedy, find out they might just have more in common than other could ever have imagined.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
