&lt;p>Man I love his shorts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This one goes more scifi and deals more with time travel and parallel realities than the other (which had more scifi interacting with religion), but I love them both.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In particular, I &lt;em>The Merchant and the Alchemist&amp;rsquo;s Gate&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom&lt;/em> were my favorites. The eponymous &lt;em>Exhalation&lt;/em> was an interesting look at entropy. And &lt;em>The Lifestyle of Software Objects&lt;/em>, by far the longest, had the time to go even more through the development of the idea over years (in universe).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, I think that especially from this book, I find that I enjoy scifi more in shorts&amp;ndash;you have time to explore many more &lt;em>ideas&lt;/em> there&amp;ndash;and longer form in fantasy&amp;ndash;really digging into the worlds and characters more than the ideas.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t often read anthologies, but perhaps I should read more. I do love me some epic fantasy (I&amp;rsquo;ve read the entire &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-wheel-of-time/">The Wheel of Time&lt;/a> half a dozen times now&amp;hellip;), but there&amp;rsquo;s just something about a story that builds up quickly, gets to the point, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t stick around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think of the 8, I only bounced off 1 (which was actually a fine story, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t suspend disbelief enough for the premise) and 1 was a bit meh, just for how short it was. 6 of 8 I absolutely loved though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Absolutely worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
