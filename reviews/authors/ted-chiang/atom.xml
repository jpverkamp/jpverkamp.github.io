&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t often read anthologies, but perhaps I should read more. I do love me some epic fantasy (I&amp;rsquo;ve read the entire &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-wheel-of-time/">The Wheel of Time&lt;/a> half a dozen times now&amp;hellip;), but there&amp;rsquo;s just something about a story that builds up quickly, gets to the point, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t stick around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think of the 8, I only bounced off 1 (which was actually a fine story, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t suspend disbelief enough for the premise) and 1 was a bit meh, just for how short it was. 6 of 8 I absolutely loved though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Absolutely worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
