&lt;p>All the miles of a hard road are worth a moment of true happiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I enjoy fables. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice way to illustrate various lessons and morals and pass them along to children somewhat subtly. Especially when you take the wordcraft and illustrations of &lt;a data-goodreads-type="author" data-goodreads-id="12447" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12447.arnold-lobel">Arnold Lobel&lt;/a> (&lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="18085528" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18085528.frog-and-toad-storybook-treasury-4-complete-stories-in-1-volume">Frog and Toad&lt;/a>).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Frog and Toad Storybook Treasury: 4 Complete Stories in 1 Volume!</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/01/28/frog-and-toad-storybook-treasury-4-complete-stories-in-1-volume/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/01/28/frog-and-toad-storybook-treasury-4-complete-stories-in-1-volume/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="18085528" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18085528.frog-and-toad-storybook-treasury-4-complete-stories-in-1-volume">Frog and Toad&lt;/a> are wonderful, full stop. It&amp;rsquo;s a collection of collections, with 4 parts, each of which has a handful (5?) of short stories. You can read the individual stories or go through them all back to back (as I did over the last few nights). The stories are thematically related, but there&amp;rsquo;s no real plot between them, so no reason to read them in any particular order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think my favorite part of reading this is sharing just how wonderful the relationship between Frog and Toad is. They may argue sometimes, but they&amp;rsquo;re always supportive in the end and really great friends. Also, I love doing voices. For me Toad ended up with a deep &amp;lsquo;toadlike&amp;rsquo; voice and Frog somehow ended up being &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/characters/nm0233391">Mouse from the Matrix&lt;/a>&amp;hellip; Who knows.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
