Not quite what I expected. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a reference on how to tie one of the various mentioned tools into a C# project yourself, it will have a potentially useful starter at least. Other than that, the specific sections could use a bit more fleshing out to be useful alone and all together, it&amp;rsquo;s an odd combination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Structurewise, the first section of the book was odd. Basically a tutorial of C#, but only a limited subset of functionality, chosen oddly. Then a number of web related things. Sure. Weird, but fair enough. Then we have SQL injections and XSS, which are discussed in more depth other places. Yes, this book ties them to C#, but it&amp;rsquo;s string processing. Nothing super specific to any particular language there.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
