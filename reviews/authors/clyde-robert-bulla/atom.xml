It&amp;rsquo;s historical fiction: the story of three young children in London and later on a journey to the new world. The children never existed, but a lot of the events that that happened either could have happened (their life in London) or in a general (the &lt;em&gt;Sea Adventure&lt;/em&gt; was a real ship and the problems with it&amp;rsquo;s journey and Jamestown are real history).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, it&amp;rsquo;s a depressing story. The children&amp;rsquo;s father is an ocean away, their mother is sick ( &lt;span class="spoiler"&gt;and dies, to little surprise for older readers&lt;/span&gt;
 ), the family taking care of them is exploitive, their stand in father figure &lt;span class="spoiler"&gt;also eventually dies&lt;/span&gt;
 , and they &lt;span class="spoiler"&gt;get shipwrecked&lt;/span&gt;
 . On the other hand, I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s a good way to teach the idea of &amp;rsquo;no matter what life throws at you, just keep on keeping on'?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
