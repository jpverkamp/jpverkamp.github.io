It&amp;rsquo;s historical fiction: the story of three young children in London and later on a journey to the new world. The children never existed, but a lot of the events that that happened either could have happened (their life in London) or in a general (the &lt;em>Sea Adventure&lt;/em> was a real ship and the problems with it&amp;rsquo;s journey and Jamestown are real history).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the most part, it&amp;rsquo;s a depressing story. The children&amp;rsquo;s father is an ocean away, their mother is sick ( &lt;span class="spoiler">and dies, to little surprise for older readers&lt;/span>
 ), the family taking care of them is exploitive, their stand in father figure &lt;span class="spoiler">also eventually dies&lt;/span>
 , and they &lt;span class="spoiler">get shipwrecked&lt;/span>
 . On the other hand, I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s a good way to teach the idea of &amp;rsquo;no matter what life throws at you, just keep on keeping on'?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
