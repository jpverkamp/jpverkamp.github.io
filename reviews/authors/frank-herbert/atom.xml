&lt;p>I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I last read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/08/23/dune/">Dune&lt;/a> more than a decade ago and saw both the movie and the TV mini-series about as long ago. From this long ago, and from being such a stable in the science fiction mindspace, I remember a lot of the general things that would happen, but had forgotten most of the details. Unfortunately, I think that might be the best way to remember it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
