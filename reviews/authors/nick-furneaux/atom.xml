They hit a number of my personal interests, in particular low cryptography and level network protocols/data formats. I&amp;rsquo;m generally familiar with how blockchains work in general and have actually played a bit with demo implementations of the same technology. That being said, there are a lot of details on the business and variety between different technologies that I find less than knowledgeable about.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The book will not help you build your own cryptocurrency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book is not a detailed technical deconstruction of the technologies behind cryptocurrencies, although I do cover them in sufficient detail for you to be able to understand the concepts and explain them to others.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote></description></item></channel></rss>
