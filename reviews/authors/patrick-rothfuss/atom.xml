&lt;p>For the most part, everything that I wrote in still holds true here. The worldbuilding is really cool (sygaldry in particular) and the writing itself just keeps pulling you along. I always wanted to know more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Name of the Wind</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/19/the-name-of-the-wind/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/19/the-name-of-the-wind/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve heard rather good things about this book, so figured I had to read it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the good end, it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting fantasy world with something of its own take on worldbuilding, magic, and critters (near enough to various sources, but it still fresh to me). I particularly like how magic works. There are parts of it which are well understood by those who study such things and work more or less like technology. Then there are the truly fantastical bits, used by few and understood by fewer&amp;ndash;but still with a hint of structure under it. I like it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
