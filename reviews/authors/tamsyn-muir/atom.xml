Which makes Harrow the Ninth all the harder to read&amp;ndash;and especially review. This is going to be one of the most spoilery reviews I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s necessary. If you don&amp;rsquo;t do spoilers: read the book. It&amp;rsquo;s worth it. But it&amp;rsquo;s going to be weird and confusing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. There is an absolute boatload to love about this book. The worldbuilding is still a fascinating combination of sci-fi and gothic (literally necromancers in space). The wording is still wonderful and weird and funny.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gideon the Ninth</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/13/gideon-the-ninth/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/13/gideon-the-ninth/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>One day eighteen years ago, Gideon&amp;rsquo;s mother had tumbled down the middle of
the shaft in a dragchute and a battered hazard suite, like some moth
drifting slowly down into the dark. The suit had been out of power for a
couple of minutes. The woman landed brain-dead. All the battery power had
been sucked away by a bio-container plugged into the suit, the kind you&amp;rsquo;d
care a transplant limb in, and inside that container was Gideon, only a day
old.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was obviously mysterious as hell.&lt;/p>
