&lt;p>There are no secrets, there is no mystery. We make that all up. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s all right there in front of us. You have to have enough food to get through winter and spring. That&amp;rsquo;s what it all comes down to. You have to live in a way that will gather enough food each fall to get through winter.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Take a survival story (a la Gary Paulsen&amp;rsquo;s Hatchet), re-tune it for a world where survival is life rather than a temporary situation (ten thousand or so years ago), sprinkle in an oddly modern feeling narrator, and make it super horny&amp;hellip; voila. Shaman.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I at once rather enjoyed it and was rather annoyed by good parts of it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Aurora</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/09/08/aurora/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/09/08/aurora/</guid><description>&lt;p>Aurora is something of a strange book. The core of the story follows a generation ship heading out to Tau Ceti at 1/10th the speed of light. The story starts after six generations and more than a hundred years have already passed, just before they arrive. Things are already going wrong and never really get better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing that I really didn&amp;rsquo;t expect was how quickly the story goes. Perhaps influenced by &lt;em>Coyote&lt;/em> novels by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/allen-steele/">Allen Steele&lt;/a>. This time around though, maybe 10% of the way through and we&amp;rsquo;re already at Tau Ceti. Halfway through and things have already gone terribly. Another quarter and we&amp;rsquo;ve got &lt;span class="spoiler">half the ship heading back and half staying on another world, never to be heard from again&lt;/span>
 . The last section deals with &lt;span class="spoiler">returning to Earth&lt;/span>
 and is honestly pretty skippable in my opinion. Any one of these could have been a decent chunk of a story all by itself, but all together and there&amp;rsquo;s a constant feeling of flux from story to story.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
