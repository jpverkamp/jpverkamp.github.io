The core of the story follows a generation ship heading out to Tau Ceti at 1/10th the speed of light. The story starts after six generations and more than a hundred years have already passed, just before they arrive. Things are already going wrong and never really get better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing that I really didn&amp;rsquo;t expect was how quickly the story goes. Perhaps influenced by &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="686344" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/686344.coyote"> Coyote &lt;/a> novels by &lt;a data-goodreads-type="author" data-goodreads-id="73419" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/73419.allen-steele"> Allen Steele &lt;/a> . This time around though, maybe 10% of the way through and we&amp;rsquo;re already at Tau Ceti. Halfway through and things have already gone terribly. Another quarter and we&amp;rsquo;ve got &lt;span class="spoiler">half the ship heading back and half staying on another world, never to be heard from again&lt;/span>
. The last section deals with &lt;span class="spoiler">returning to Earth&lt;/span>
and is honestly pretty skippable in my opinion. Any one of these could have been a decent chunk of a story all by itself, but all together and there&amp;rsquo;s a constant feeling of flux from story to story.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
