&lt;p>Kid friendly graphic novel about a young boy named Jack with a single mother working multiple jobs to keep everything afloat and a non-verbal autistic kid sister (Maddy) that he helps take care of. That&amp;rsquo;s already a bunch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we haven&amp;rsquo;t even gotten to the point where they trade the family car for some magic beans (get it? Jack?), grow a crazy magical farm, befriend homeschooled neighborhood girl Lily, and adventures ensue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a great time and I really do appreciate the increased variety of characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, well worth a read and the children enjoy it as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Little Robot</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/02/22/little-robot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/02/22/little-robot/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s adorable!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of my children brought it over to read. On one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s a difficult book to read&amp;ndash;there&amp;rsquo;s not much in the way of words for most of the book. On the other hand, most of the words there are are crazy robot sounds, which are a lot of fun to make! And I expect the lower number of words is going to make it all the easier for my children as they get more comfortable reading themselves.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
