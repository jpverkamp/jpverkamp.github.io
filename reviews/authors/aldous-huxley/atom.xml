Figured it was probably about time. ðŸ˜„&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, take the modern world and turn a number of interesting trends up to 11. Dissolve family ties. Genetically engineer children as a sort of uber-caste system. Make sex purely recreational. Add to that the perspective of &amp;rsquo;the Savage&amp;rsquo;. One raised on a reservation without this &amp;lsquo;modern&amp;rsquo; world&amp;ndash;giving an outsider&amp;rsquo;s perspective to all the changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the craziest thing is that this book was written in 1932&amp;hellip; Oddly prescient that. It could extrapolate from today&amp;rsquo;s world about as easily as the world of almost a century ago. Probably a bit more influence from the Internet and social media; perhaps more commentary on how the sexual revolution in Brave New World compares to what actually happened in the decades after the book&amp;rsquo;s release. But I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what else I&amp;rsquo;d see changed. A mark of good distopian sci-fi, that. For better or for worse.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
