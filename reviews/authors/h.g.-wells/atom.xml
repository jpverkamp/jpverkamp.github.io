As such, it reads a bit differently than more modern books of the same genre. Rather than dealing overmuch with character or plot, it takes an idea (a time machine!) and runs with it, exploring how such an idea might change the world and exploring our own world through the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far as that goes, The Time Machine is an interesting book. We get a look at one possible future, some 800,000 years in the future, where humanity has evolved into two radically different peoples. It&amp;rsquo;s something of a depressing look at the future, looking into what might be if the gap between the wealthy and the working classes continues to widen and the downfall of both. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting read and works either as philosophical musing or as an adventure tale, which is pretty cool.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
