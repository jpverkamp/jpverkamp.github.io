&lt;p>Mum spent a lot of time in my formative years gently reminding me that people don’t think about us nearly as much as we think they do, because they’re all busy worrying what people are thinking about them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>El is a super dramatic senior&amp;ndash;and she&amp;rsquo;s got her reasons, with the whole potential Dark Goddess thing she has going on&amp;ndash;and life is only getting weirder. She&amp;rsquo;s determined to get &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em> out, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the least bit of sense and she&amp;rsquo;s absolutely going to do it in world ending style. Oh, and of course there&amp;rsquo;s Orion. What&amp;rsquo;s up with that relationship, am I right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, if you loved &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/13/a-deadly-education/">A Deadly Education&lt;/a> (as I did), you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to love The Last Graduate. It turns the whole Scholomance craziness up to 11, gives us a dark chosen one that actually kind of works within the world building, and I really do love and care for the characters. And if the cliff hanger at the end of book 1 wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough&amp;hellip; THERE&amp;rsquo;S AN EVEN WORSE ONE AND THE NEXT BOOK ISN&amp;rsquo;T EVEN OUT YET.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways. Read it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Deadly Education</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/13/a-deadly-education/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/13/a-deadly-education/</guid><description>Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s a joy of a book. Saying which I suppose&amp;ndash;after you&amp;rsquo;ve read it&amp;ndash;feels a bit ironic.
It&amp;rsquo;s one part magic school, with your more or less typical teenage protagonists doing more or less typical teenage thing. In my opinion, Novik does this very well. Main character El (short for Galadriel) is so wonderfully snarky and done with it teenage girl that I could practically feel her angst coming off the page&amp;ndash;and it&amp;rsquo;s all the better, because she really does have a good reason for it.</description></item><item><title>Spinning Silver</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/09/21/spinning-silver/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/09/21/spinning-silver/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The real story isn’t half as pretty as the one you’ve heard. The real story is, the miller’s daughter with her long golden hair wants to catch a lord, a prince, a rich man’s son, so she goes to the moneylender and borrows for a ring and a necklace and decks herself out for the festival. And she’s beautiful enough, so the lord, the prince, the rich man’s son notices her, and dances with her, and tumbles her in a quiet hayloft when the dancing is over, and afterwards he goes home and marries the rich woman his family has picked out for him. Then the miller’s despoiled daughter tells everyone that the moneylender’s in league with the devil, and the village runs him out or maybe even stones him, so at least she gets to keep the jewels for a dowry, and the blacksmith marries her before that firstborn child comes along a little early. Because that’s what the story’s really about: getting out of paying your debts.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The only other Naomi Novik book I&amp;rsquo;ve read was &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="28876" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28876.his-majestys-dragon">His Majesty&amp;#39;s Dragon&lt;/a>, which I . Which makes it all the more surprising how much I loved Spinning Silver.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>His Majesty's Dragon</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/25/his-majestys-dragon/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/25/his-majestys-dragon/</guid><description>&lt;p>This one is a little different, since although there eight novels currently out in the Temeraire series (with another due this year), I don&amp;rsquo;t plan on finishing the series at the moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was always something that I had in mind when I set my 100 book goal. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of books to read and if I&amp;rsquo;m just not enjoying a series overly much, it&amp;rsquo;s worth moving along.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
