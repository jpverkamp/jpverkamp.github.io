&lt;p>Many Indigenous people believe that one should never whistle at night. This belief takes many forms: for instance, Native Hawaiians believe it summons the Hukai’po, the spirits of ancient warriors, and Native Mexicans say it calls Lechuza, a witch that can transform into an owl. But what all these legends hold in common is the certainty that whistling at night can cause evil spirits to appear—and even follow you home.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A collection of two dozen horror (and otherwise dark fiction) stories by a wide variety of indigenous authors. Three of which I&amp;rsquo;d read before:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/rebecca-roanhorse/">Rebecca Roanhorse&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/darcie-little-badger/">Darcie Little Badger&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/cherie-dimaline/">Cherie Dimaline&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Like any anthology there are some stories in here that I didn&amp;rsquo;t care much for&amp;ndash;and some that really hit hard. Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating new look (for me) into all sorts of new and interesting creepy things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And all too often, you might just find that people are people. And people are scarier than any monster out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>So, for these next pages, let these writers take you by the hand, lead you into the darkness at the heart of—let me put some quotation marks around it—“America.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote></description></item></channel></rss>
