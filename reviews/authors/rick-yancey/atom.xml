&lt;p>After the 1st wave, only darkness remains.&lt;br>
After the 2nd, only the lucky escape.&lt;br>
And after the 3rd, only the unlucky survive.&lt;br>
After the 4th wave, only one rule applies: trust no one.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the world (as we know it). The aliens came and killed off most of humanity&amp;ndash;in some actually fairly interesting ways. This is the story of what comes next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first, it&amp;rsquo;s the story of Cassie after the end of the world. How she survives each wave (not told in order), how things keep getting worse, and then finally how she starts to find some &lt;em>other&lt;/em> survivors.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“I would kill for a cheeseburger. Honestly. If I stumbled across someone eating a cheeseburger, I would kill them for it.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But then we start getting a few more points of view. More survivors and their own stories of death. Child soldiers. Human* survivors every bit as bad as the aliens. A possible look into what comes next.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How do you rid the Earth of humans? Rid the humans of their humanity.&lt;/p>
