&lt;p>Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the &amp;gt; shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you &amp;gt; could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choicesâ€¦ &amp;gt; Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your &amp;gt; regrets?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a surprisingly wonderful story. It&amp;rsquo;s something of a mix of It&amp;rsquo;s a Wonderful Life and Borges&amp;rsquo; The Library of Babel. Nora Seed finds herself in a dark place, between life and death&amp;ndash;and that place just happens to look to her like a library. A library with a book for every life she could have lived, every choice she could have made.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
