&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m vaguely aware of the general idea of the Arabian Nights&amp;ndash;a woman is threatened with death and staves it off by telling such an amazing story each night&amp;hellip; And then always leaving them wanting more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except apparently within the stories, there are more story tellers. I think it got at least 4-5 layers deep before I noticed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And&amp;hellip; never returned to the frame story? Weird that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, the individual stories are fun enough, even if some get more than a bit questionable and/or gruesome. But I enjoyed them. I wonder how much of that is the stories and how much this particular translation.&lt;/p>
