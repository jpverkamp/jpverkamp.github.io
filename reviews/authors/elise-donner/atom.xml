&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Jake spoke. His eyes were dull but his voice was firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Things are different,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;From now on, we take what we need. We do what we have to do. No matter what the consequences.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jake . . .&amp;rdquo; Cassie began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s only one morph that will get us thousands of miles out to sea in the time we have left,&amp;rdquo; he added. &amp;ldquo;Human.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s kind of amazing how out in the open/direct thins things are getting. We have less than ten books left, but still. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An intense book. And more to come.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Reunion</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/24/the-reunion/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/24/the-reunion/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Interesting,&amp;gt; Ax observed. &amp;lt;Bearded, white-coated creatures with hooves. And horns. Grazers. I would point out the similarities between the mountain goat and Andalites, except for my extremely disappointing experience with the cow.&amp;gt; (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/17/the-experiment/"&gt;The Experiment&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so Marco&amp;rsquo;s mom is back&amp;ndash;and after the mess of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/04/the-decision/"&gt;The Decision&lt;/a&gt;, she&amp;rsquo;s not Visser One anymore. But if anything, that means that she hates Visser Three all the more&amp;hellip; and would stop at nothing to get back at him. Even if that means allying herself with the &amp;lsquo;Andalite Bandits&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marco of course deals with this in a perfectly reasonable and level headed manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you do when you have to make a decision, and each choice is horrible? What would you do, Rachel? If it was your mom or dad or sisters. What would you do, Xena?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel came back and sat beside me on the bed. She didn&amp;rsquo;t hug me. Rachel&amp;rsquo;s not a hugger. But she sat there with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One battle at a time, Marco. One battle at a time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an intense book and man I feel for Marco. Tobias and Ax are really going through some stuff, but they&amp;rsquo;re only sort of human any more. Of the remaining Animorphs&amp;ndash;well, I think that it&amp;rsquo;s Marco that&amp;rsquo;s gone through the most. And this book certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t go easy on him.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
