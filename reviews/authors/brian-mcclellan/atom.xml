&lt;p>Superstitious people claimed that the Hock had been carved by a war between gods millennia ago. During his time in the labor camps, Styke had once been partnered with a geologist&amp;ndash;one of those government-employed fellows sent to look for likely deposits of gold ore&amp;ndash;who had insisted that this sarp terrain had been caused by immense mountains of ice creeping their way across the land tends of thousands of years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Styke had always dismissed him as a lunatic.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;But, sir, you look like you&amp;rsquo;ve seen a ghost!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Robson considered the brief vision, his brow furrowing as he let it hand in his mind for a few moments. &amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; he sad. &amp;ldquo;Not a ghost. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

Basically, The Autumn Republic builds on the world of the first two books, without really needing to introduce much in the way of new characters (with a few relatively minor exceptions) or new world building, instead taking everything to a final conclusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far as the characters go, I really found myself rooting for the good guys and hoping they would save the day, even when they did some not entirely unobjectionable things. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m glad that Adamat&amp;rsquo;s story at least didn&amp;rsquo;t get any worse and that he managed to survive (spoilers) all the crap that the Marked and Privileged put him through.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Crimson Campaign</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/02/the-crimson-campaign/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/02/the-crimson-campaign/</guid><description>&lt;p>I think the main reason that I had some problems following all of the different storylines in the first Powder Mage book was that I was reading one chapter per day and discussion as I went. Reading straight through the second book helped keep everything together. It also helps that there are few to no new major characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, this was very much the second book in a trilogy. It picks up where the first left off and sets up the third. It probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stand particularly well alone, but then again it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty much action all of the way through, tying up various plot lines just to ramp things up even more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Promise of Blood</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/10/30/promise-of-blood/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/10/30/promise-of-blood/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure what to think about this book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, there are several varied magic systems in this book. You have the Privileged, the Marked, and the Knacked.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
