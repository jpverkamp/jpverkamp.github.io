&lt;p>Now, if you’ve never had a flaming, skull-faced bear on roller skates barreling at you full speed, you don’t know what you’re missing.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so Carl and Princess Donut descend to the third floor. With a choice of race (of course Donut will choose Cat, was there ever any doubt?) and class.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>NecroBard This unusual class combines one of the most-loved occupations with one of the most reviled.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things are going to get worse (of course) even as they get better (or at least higher level). And now, we&amp;rsquo;re getting the first hints of life in teh rest of the universe&amp;ndash;outside of the Dungeon!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“If that’s true,” I said, “then you’re all in that same pot.” I turned to look at the audience. “All of you. If a government is afraid of what its people say, then maybe there’s a reason for it.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Politics, yo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m fully expecting more of that as the series goes on!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a worthy successor to the first one and I&amp;rsquo;m still interested to see where in the &lt;em>world&lt;/em> this series can even go from here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dungeon Crawler Carl</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/11/15/dungeon-crawler-carl/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/11/15/dungeon-crawler-carl/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Goddammit Donut!&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This book has no right to be quite so fun as it is. Billions of people die in the first chapter, it’s full of blood and gore and formerly-living-detritus, and the entire thing feels like a video game—menus, inventory, levels, and loot boxes included.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>New achievement! You’ve killed an armed mob with your bare fucking hands! Holy crap, dude. That’s kinda fucked up. Reward: You’ve received a Bronze Weapon Box!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
