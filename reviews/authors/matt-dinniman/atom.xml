&lt;p&gt;Ever since that first monkey looked up into the sky and saw something twinkling up there, you meat puppets have tried to force twenty pounds of existential meaning into a ten pound sack of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy crap things just keep escalating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have another single level this time. Bubbles in space, each populated by a subset of crawlers that can&amp;rsquo;t (initially) interact, and each of which separated into air/earth/water/underground sections with their own puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course by the end Carl has done an excellent job of not being broken (more or less), saved people, killed even more people, and managed to summon and/or fight entirely too many (feral) gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know what, Carl? I’ve decided something,” Donut said, finally speaking. She released Mongo, who squawked and started investigating this strange, new world. “Yeah, Donut?” “I think they’re right about you. I think you’re crazy. Like, not a little weird crazy. Not guy who eats cereal without milk crazy. But crazy, crazy. Straitjacket crazy.” I took the cat into my lap, and then I pulled her to my chest. She purred heavily into my ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man that ending hits hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now&amp;hellip; based on the afterward, we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; going to have some complications next book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/12/21/the-dungeon-anarchists-cookbook/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/12/21/the-dungeon-anarchists-cookbook/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked Bautista, I thought as I finished building my train bomb, but his Tigran race made him look like a tiger that had been vomited upon by a Lisa Frank notebook. I didn’t know how anything could embarrass him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s another fun one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two major things that stand out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The titular Dungeon &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist%20Cookbook"&gt;Anarchist’s Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s a fun idea already and I&amp;rsquo;m just waiting to see what more can be done with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The floor of the dungeon we spend most of the time on&amp;ndash;trains. All the trains in a chaotic snarl. Delightful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the stakes just keep rising (which, all things considered, is impressive).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Carl's Doomsday Scenario</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/11/23/carls-doomsday-scenario/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/11/23/carls-doomsday-scenario/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you’ve never had a flaming, skull-faced bear on roller skates barreling at you full speed, you don’t know what you’re missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so Carl and Princess Donut descend to the third floor. With a choice of race (of course Donut will choose Cat, was there ever any doubt?) and class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NecroBard This unusual class combines one of the most-loved occupations with one of the most reviled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are going to get worse (of course) even as they get better (or at least higher level). And now, we&amp;rsquo;re getting the first hints of life in teh rest of the universe&amp;ndash;outside of the Dungeon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If that’s true,” I said, “then you’re all in that same pot.” I turned to look at the audience. “All of you. If a government is afraid of what its people say, then maybe there’s a reason for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politics, yo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m fully expecting more of that as the series goes on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a worthy successor to the first one and I&amp;rsquo;m still interested to see where in the &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt; this series can even go from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dungeon Crawler Carl</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/11/15/dungeon-crawler-carl/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/11/15/dungeon-crawler-carl/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goddammit Donut!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book has no right to be quite so fun as it is. Billions of people die in the first chapter, it’s full of blood and gore and formerly-living-detritus, and the entire thing feels like a video game—menus, inventory, levels, and loot boxes included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New achievement! You’ve killed an armed mob with your bare fucking hands! Holy crap, dude. That’s kinda fucked up. Reward: You’ve received a Bronze Weapon Box!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
