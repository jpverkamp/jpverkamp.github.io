Starts weird but interesting and gets better from there. I’ll reiterate though that I can’t really imagine buying these by issue, especially in real time. A volume has enough meat to it to sustain a storyline.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 3: The Fear Machine</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/01/hellblazer-vol.-3-the-fear-machine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/01/hellblazer-vol.-3-the-fear-machine/</guid><description>&lt;p>Not terrible, but also not great. It starts very slowly with a hippie commune and takes a few issues to get going and gets downright weird at a few points. But enjoyable enough after that.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Oh boy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then it goes all weird hippy commune. Sure? I don’t really get it. Imagine paying for this as a single issue…&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shepherds-warning">Shepherd’s Warning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Well, it’s more of the same story, but there’s potential at least!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 2: The Devil You Know</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/23/hellblazer-vol.-2-the-devil-you-know/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/23/hellblazer-vol.-2-the-devil-you-know/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that’s a ride. The continuation of the Swamp Thing sexy times storyline, some more backstory on how Constantine got to be how he is, Constantine all Arthurian (for some reason), and a straight up horror story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Weaker than volume 1 but worth continuing to volume 3!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sex-and-death">Sex and Death&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Starts where we left off, with Constantine out of body and the Swamp Thing doing his mating thing… That is not a plot line I care at all about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 1: Original Sins</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/14/hellblazer-vol.-1-original-sins/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/14/hellblazer-vol.-1-original-sins/</guid><description>&lt;p>I really do have a thing for urban fantasy specifically dealing with demons and angels, good and evil, especially if it twists it all around. Constantine does that in spades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I watched the 2005 film well before I knew it was based on a comic (so sue me), so Keanu Reeves is forever going to be stuck in my head as the true Constantine, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also watched just about all of the new wave of DC shows, including the 2014 version of Constantine plus his appearances on Legends of Tomorrow. Not quite the same, but I still loved the character.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
