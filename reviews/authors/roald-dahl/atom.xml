&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m really only familiar with stories like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach. They&amp;rsquo;re certainly fantastical stories with a number of fairly subtle dark twists to them, but still well within the realm of children&amp;rsquo;s stories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well&amp;hellip; it turns out he wrote some more adult, much more tense ones at all. It&amp;rsquo;s somewhere in that border realm between realism, fantasy, and horror, not quite terrifying but certainly creepy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The stories are quick and always have the creepy sort of twist, although I&amp;rsquo;ll admit there were a few I just don&amp;rsquo;t really get. So it goes. Still worth it, in my opinion.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
