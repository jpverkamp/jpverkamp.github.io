On one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s 1960s scifi in a nutshell, full of tensions about the &amp;lsquo;Other Side&amp;rsquo; (obvious enough), weird but fascinating scientific gadgets and ideas, sexism, and with odd pacing and dialog. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty much what I remember from other Asimov novels, although it&amp;rsquo;s been a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is amusing, given that unlike what I&amp;rsquo;d guessed, in this case the movie actually game first. Based on a short by Otto Klement and Jerome Bixby, Asimov only got involved in the novelization&amp;ndash;and then only if he was given leave to do the science properly. For the most part, he did. I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough ananotomy to know if anything in particular is wrong, but it makes me want to know &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;, which I think is pretty much the entire point of the thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
