&lt;p>“You must understand that he knew the risks of living in an undeveloped civilization. Creatures of lesser intelligence cannot be held responsible for their acts of barbarity. You have not yet learned a better way.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve only read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/02/28/skyward/">Skyward&lt;/a> before of that series, so on re-reading, I noticed that Defending Elysium is sort of a prequel? It&amp;rsquo;s unclear to me exactly how much. It feels like the same world, but set well before and with none of the same characters? Especially since I haven&amp;rsquo;t read past Skyward before&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a bit more worldbuilding and background than I&amp;rsquo;d otherwise be aware of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Short, but worth a read in my opinion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Lost Metal</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/27/the-lost-metal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/27/the-lost-metal/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mate, it ain&amp;rsquo;t violence if it&amp;rsquo;s religion.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so it ends. The second era of one of the more ambitious ideas in fantasy: take a fantasy world with a hard/scientific magic system (or three), tell a crazy story in that world, and then advance a few hundred years so that the first story becomes the myths and religions of the world. Not only that, but (specifically in the Lost Metal), take that same idea and expand it across a shared universe of fantasy worlds, each with their own feel and magic and start really bringing things in from other worlds, mashing them together and seeing just what sort of madness pops out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>White Sand, Volume 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/02/21/white-sand-volume-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/02/21/white-sand-volume-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Onward and conclusionward! All the political machinations to save the Sand Masters (and himself) are coming to a head. It&amp;rsquo;s a fine enough central plot, even if the random assassinations / friend that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get along well with his father / scientist from the other side of the world / bodyguard that hates you and you have to win over subplots really do get to be a bit random and disorientating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s really a problem with the whole set of graphic novels though and&amp;ndash;if I remember correctly&amp;ndash;I had the same problem with the prose version years ago. It&amp;rsquo;s not a deal breaker, but I feel like the whole thing could be cleaned up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>White Sand, Volume 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/02/18/white-sand-volume-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/02/18/white-sand-volume-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the things that I feared most about getting into these stories is the big &amp;lsquo;art style change&amp;rsquo;. I see it. It&amp;rsquo;s definately different. But having read all manner of graphic novels over the last year&amp;ndash;some change &lt;em>far&lt;/em> more dramatically than this. They&amp;rsquo;re similar enough that I barely even noticed for the most part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it still is quite beautful:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>White Sand, Volume 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/02/16/white-sand-volume-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/02/16/white-sand-volume-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>White Sand has something of an odd story. It&amp;rsquo;s the first novel Sanderson finished (and also the 7th, a complete rewrite), but in prose form was never published. You can get it if you ask him (I think signing up for the newsletter? It&amp;rsquo;s been a few years) and I read it back in 2016.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now though, the same story has been actually published as a three volume set of graphic novels. Having gotten rather more into graphic novels over the last year, of course I had to give it a try, so here we go!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rhythm of War</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/21/rhythm-of-war/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/21/rhythm-of-war/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Heroism is a myth you tell idealistic young people—specifically when you &amp;gt; want them to go bleed for you. It got one of my sons killed and another &amp;gt; taken from me. You can keep your heroism and return to me the lives of those &amp;gt; wasted on foolish conflicts.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well dang. After the absolutely bonkersiosity of the first three Stormlight Archive books, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t the slightest idea how Sanderson was going to pull off yet another (and another and another coming down the pipeline). And yet here we are.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dawnshard</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/28/dawnshard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/28/dawnshard/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that was unexpectedly wonderful. I was all set to dive into the behemoth that is and then I noticed that there&amp;rsquo;s a 50k word &amp;lsquo;short&amp;rsquo; to read before it. I loved &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="34703445" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34703445.edgedancer">Edgedancer&lt;/a>, so let&amp;rsquo;s give this a try!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end, this I do not regret at all. &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="34703445" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34703445.edgedancer">Edgedancer&lt;/a> is a story that could was too long to be an interlude and too different to be in the main storyline, but having read it is a story that every much needed to be told.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Edgedancer</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/25/edgedancer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/25/edgedancer/</guid><description>&lt;p>Edgedancer is a short story set in Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s Cosmere, specifically on Roshar of the Stormlight Archive. It features Lift, a young girl who was first featured in one of the interludes of interludes and now has a story all to her own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short, Lift is a lot of fun. She&amp;rsquo;s a surgebinder who can make herself &amp;lsquo;awesome&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;her term for it&amp;ndash;and basically ignore friction. She seems an overall good person with a somewhat odd sense of morals and has a way of talking and acting that will just leave you smiling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lies of the Beholder</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/04/13/lies-of-the-beholder/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/04/13/lies-of-the-beholder/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Who cares?” I said. “Yes, it’s all in my head. But pain is ‘all in my head’ too. Love is ‘all in my head.’ All the things that matter in life are the things you can’t measure! The things our brains make up! Being made-up doesn’t make them unimportant.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a few years since I last read &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="13452375" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13452375.legion">Legion&lt;/a> and , so when I saw a there was a new (and apparently last) part out, I had to give it a try. This time around, I listened to all three on audiobook and that, I can highly recommend. It&amp;rsquo;s a solid production and each aspect having their own voice helps that little bit more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Children of the Nameless</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/04/10/children-of-the-nameless/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/04/10/children-of-the-nameless/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey, it&amp;rsquo;s Sanderson. I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a chance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Taking place in the greater Magic the Gathering universe, there&amp;rsquo;s a feel for a huge world we&amp;rsquo;re only seeing a corner of. Names That Matter left and right and nowhere near enough time to learn what they all mean&amp;hellip; but if you just go with it, you&amp;rsquo;ll figure out enough for this particular story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Skyward</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/02/28/skyward/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/02/28/skyward/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I imagined those broken rocks as the broken bodies of my enemies, their bones shattered, their trembling arms reaching upward in a useless gesture of total and complete defeat. I was a very odd little girl.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Spensa (Spin) is an odd girl in an odd world. Humanity is trapped on an alien planet for reasons (initially) unknown. The sky is filled with rubble and debris that occasionally rains down on them and from time to time aliens come down and try to kill them. Spin&amp;rsquo;s father is a pilot, trying to protect them, but he dies early in the book (before a timeskip), called a coward&amp;ndash;seemingly one of the worst things you can call someone in this world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oathbringer</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/03/02/oathbringer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/03/02/oathbringer/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hooooly crap. The first three quarters of Oathbringer are fairly slow. They&amp;rsquo;re still fascinating, building up more and more of the world of The Stormlight Archive, answering some questions while raising even more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then crap really hits the fan. I read the final several hundred pages in one session and wow a lot of things happen. Epic. Just epic. Read the book just for that and don&amp;rsquo;t put it down early.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Words of Radiance</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/02/15/words-of-radiance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/02/15/words-of-radiance/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“I am offend!” Shallan yelled. “You have offended Her Highness again!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Very offend!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“You’d better apologize.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“No apologize!” Shallan declared. “Boots!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kal leaned back, looking between the two of them, trying to parse what had just been said. “Boots?” he asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Yes,” Shallan said. “I am liking your boots. You will apology with boots.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“You . . . want my boots?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Did you not hear Her Highness?” Tyn asked, arms folded. “Are soldiers of this Dalinar Kholin’s army so disrespectful?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I’m not disrespectful,” Kal said. “But I’m not giving her my boots.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“You insult!” Shallan declared, stepping forward, pointing at him. Stormfather, those horses were enormous! “I will tell all who are to listen! When arriving, I will say, ‘Kholin is stealer of boots and taker of women’s virtue!’”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kal sputtered. “Virtue!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Yes,” Shallan said; then she glanced over to Tyn. “Virtue? No, wrong word. Virture . . . No . . . Vesture. Vesture! Taker of woman’s vesture! That is word I wanted.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The soldier glanced to his companions, looking confused. Drat, Shallan thought. Good puns are lost on men with poor vocabulary.&lt;/p>

While each of the stories is good by itself, they really shine collected together, where you get a sense of just how big and diverse this universe that Sanderson is building is.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a creepy short (for Sanderson) that follows an older woman (probably middle aged). She&amp;rsquo;s a mother, an inn-keeper, and a bounty hunter. She&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful character and really does do a lot to sell the story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sixth of the Dusk</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/24/sixth-of-the-dusk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/24/sixth-of-the-dusk/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve previously listened about this story on the &lt;a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/"> Writing Excuses &lt;/a> podcast and read it in the [ Shadows Beneath ](&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21844946-shadows-">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21844946-shadows-&lt;/a> beneath?from_search=true) anthology, but it&amp;rsquo;s just as weird/good now as it was then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worldbuildingwise, the idea of an ocean culture that travels between terrifying islands (with just as terrifying beasties in the water) is fascinating. Sentient birds ( &lt;span class="spoiler">/ worms&lt;/span>
) that people can tame and carry with them to grant them special powers? Yes please.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Secret History</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/23/secret-history/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/23/secret-history/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Oh, hell,” Kelsier said. “There’s actually a God?” “Yes.” Kelsier decked him.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve read the Mistborn series, read Secret History. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t, read the Mistborn series, then read Secret History. It&amp;rsquo;s worth the read just for for the the crazy intertwined universe-building that Sanderson has been pulling off for years now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Allomancer Jak and the Pits of Eltania</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/21/allomancer-jak-and-the-pits-of-eltania/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/21/allomancer-jak-and-the-pits-of-eltania/</guid><description>&lt;p>Allomancer Jak is a hilarious, pulpy, over the top adventure story set on the Mistborn universe (specifically the Alloy of Law time period).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It adds a bit of world building&amp;ndash;specifically explaining how the Koloss have changed since the first era of the Final Empire&amp;ndash;but mostly it&amp;rsquo;s just fun to read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Eleventh Metal</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/19/the-eleventh-metal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/19/the-eleventh-metal/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Eleventh Metal is a short story originally written for the Mistborn Adventure Game (an RPG) that takes place before the events of the first Mistborn book. It gives us a bit more backstory about Kelsier and actually shows his own training, which is interesting enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s not bad. It&amp;rsquo;s just very short and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really add anything in particular to the rest of the Mistborn stories.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hope of Elantris</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/18/the-hope-of-elantris/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/18/the-hope-of-elantris/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a cute little side story set during the climactic final scenes of the main Elantris storyline. Basically, it&amp;rsquo;s a story that Sanderson had originally in mind for Elantris but cut due to pacing or other issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, it follows Matisse, an Elantrian who is charged with watching after the children and ends up saving them all with the help of Ashe the Seon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Emperor's Soul</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/11/the-emperors-soul/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/11/the-emperors-soul/</guid><description>&lt;p>If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been told, at first I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t realize that The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s Soul takes place in a far away corner of the same world as Elantris. But as the story wears on, and the details of the magic system are revealed, it becomes more obvious that the worlds are one and the same. I really do love how Sanderson does magic systems. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anything quite like it, especially not at the same scale. Every system seems new, yet there&amp;rsquo;s a shared core to all of them. I love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than that, I did like the character of Shai. There&amp;rsquo;s something about an artist who works entirely to know that she did it, rather than for public acclaim that I enjoy. Sneaky and subtle. Excellent. I could see a few of the twists coming (that she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t escape until the last moment; the changes she made), but that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it any less enjoyable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Snapshot</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/03/10/snapshot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/03/10/snapshot/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Mustard?” Chaz replied. “Who puts mustard on a burrito?”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Sanderson recently posted the first two chapters of Snapshot online (&lt;a href="http://brandonsanderson.com/snapshot-chapter-one/">1&lt;/a> / &lt;a href="http://brandonsanderson.com/snapshot-chapter-two/">2&lt;/a>). CLIFFHANGER! Bought the whole thing.

Luckily, at least so far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned, it not only met the expectations I had for it, it exceeded them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far as the world building / settings go, each of the Reckoners books takes an ordinary city in the former United States and weirds it. First, we had Chicago made of steel. Then New York, mostly underwater and covered with glowing spray paint. This time around? The city of Atlanta, made of salt and on the move. It&amp;rsquo;s just such a bizarre visual that it could carry a decent bit of the story just on that alone. All the little details that entails (sweat breaks down the salt, buildings crumble) just make it all the more interesting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Firefight</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/12/08/firefight/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/12/08/firefight/</guid><description>&lt;p>Firefight is a an excellent followup to Steelheart, taking everything I liked about the first book&amp;ndash;the variety of the Epics&amp;rsquo; powers and the ruined world they&amp;rsquo;ve left behind&amp;ndash;and making it better while at the same point smoothing out my one real complaint&amp;ndash;the &amp;lsquo;bad analogies&amp;rsquo;. They&amp;rsquo;re still there, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t mention them every page or two, so they actually feel funny this time around, rather than so forced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the upside, the new setting is just as crazy and cool this time around. Last time&amp;ndash;Chicago turned to steel. This time, New York City flooded to the point only the tops of skyscrapers stick out of the water, where fruit trees grow freely in buildings and spray paint glows in the night. It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful image and an interesting contrast to the relentlessly gritty steel of Newcago.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Steelheart</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/10/10/steelheart/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/10/10/steelheart/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Reckoners is everything that I love in a Sanderson book, with the main exception being that it&amp;rsquo;s not set in the otherwise shared universe of the Cosmere. It makes sense though, given that Steelheart is set in our universe (more or less).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, a bunch of people gained superpowers. In Sanderson fashion, their powers are varied and interesting and the &amp;lsquo;rules&amp;rsquo; are fairly solid. Powers range from illusions and fire to turning an entire city into metal. On top of that, every Epic (the word &amp;lsquo;Superhero&amp;rsquo; having some legal oddities around it) also has a weakness, thus fulfilling &lt;a href="http://coppermind.net/wiki/Sanderson%27s_Laws_of_Magic">Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s Second Law&lt;/a>. Also, they&amp;rsquo;re all pretty much evil. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty neat world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Skin Deep</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/08/21/skin-deep/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/08/21/skin-deep/</guid><description>&lt;p>Stephen Leeds returns!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, the &amp;lsquo;big idea&amp;rsquo; plot that sort of fades into the background is the idea of encoding research into DNA. It&amp;rsquo;s something that&amp;rsquo;s actually happening now, although (so far as we know) not actually being used to store anything in a person&amp;rsquo;s genetic code. But it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not out of the realm of possibility.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Legion</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/08/19/legion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/08/19/legion/</guid><description>&lt;p>After reading so may of Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s cosmere novels, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit odd to read one that isn&amp;rsquo;t. There&amp;rsquo;s still a &amp;lsquo;Sanderson feel&amp;rsquo; to it, both in how the characters think and interact and also in this novel&amp;rsquo;s version of a magic system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basic premise: the main character&amp;ndash;Stephen Leeds&amp;ndash;has manifest many &amp;lsquo;aspects&amp;rsquo; that only he can see. Each is a specialist in a specific field that Leeds needed to solve a particular problem. It&amp;rsquo;s left vague if the aspects are actually real (in the sense of being conscious entities, separate from Leeds himself), which makes the story all the more interesting. So far as Leeds is concerned, they are, and his mind will jump through some pretty crazy hoops to keep that illusion going.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Bands of Mourning</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/07/12/the-bands-of-mourning/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/07/12/the-bands-of-mourning/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sanderson has this tendency to completely change the world in ways that you&amp;rsquo;d never think could possibly work&amp;hellip; and yet pull them off. He did it between the first and second Mistborn books and he just did it again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worldbuilding-wise, so many things have changed. Yet he hasn&amp;rsquo;t really broken the rules that he set down in the previous books, just expanded them, exploring areas that we&amp;rsquo;ve never seen before. We learn about people that live far from the Lord Ruler&amp;rsquo;s rule. We learn about new and fascinating ways that the Metallic Arts can be used&amp;ndash;Feruchemy in particular. And we start to see just how magic and technology can be combined.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shadows of Self</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/25/shadows-of-self/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/25/shadows-of-self/</guid><description>&lt;p>Shadows of Self takes place in the same timeline and with mostly the same characters as Alloy of Law. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard, this is supposed to be the actual first book of the second trilogy, with Alloy of Law being essentially a happy accident.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wax and Wayne are back, in all their awesome glory. I still greatly enjoy what Sanderson did both with their Allomantic/Feruchemic abilities (they&amp;rsquo;re more interesting / real feeling that the full Mistborn of the original trilogy) along with their great personalities. Wayne is the best sort of crazy and Wax is just as driven as ever. Marasi also gets a chance to shine as well, becoming a constable in her own right and putting her sharp mind, passion, and years of schooling to good use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Alloy of Law</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/11/the-alloy-of-law/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/11/the-alloy-of-law/</guid><description>&lt;p>In Alloy of Law, Sanderson demonstrates not one, but two things that he&amp;rsquo;s done which I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen another author pull off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For one, he has a massive shared universe in the Cosmere. Each world has its own unique magic system (Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s strength) with just enough relation to the others to hint that they might just be part of a bigger universe.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hero of Ages</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/05/the-hero-of-ages/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/05/the-hero-of-ages/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ever since the Lord Ruler was killed in the first Mistborn book, things have been getting worse. It all comes to a head in The Hero of Ages. The world is quite literally ending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s strength continues to be his world building. We get a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> more details this time around. We learn of a few more Allomantic metals. We learn all about the third metallic art (only previously hinted at): Hemalurgy. On top of that, we expand on what exactly the Koloss and Kandra are, what abilities they have, and how they came to be. It&amp;rsquo;s crazy awesome how it all fits together and would be well worth the read just got that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Well of Ascension</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/05/16/the-well-of-ascension/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/05/16/the-well-of-ascension/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since last I read this book, I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten just how much happens in this book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the Lord Ruler was killed in The Final Empire, some things have gotten better&amp;hellip; some have gotten much much worse.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Warbreaker</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/05/08/warbreaker/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/05/08/warbreaker/</guid><description>&lt;p>I wish it hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken quite so long to get to Warbreaker. It&amp;rsquo;s really quite a good book, right up there with pretty much all of the rest of Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a neat magic system (as there always is)&amp;ndash;although this time around it felt a bit less detailed than Sanderson usually is. Usually even when as a reader doesn&amp;rsquo;t know all of the rules, you get the idea that there &lt;em>are&lt;/em> rules. This time, it just felt a bit more vague. I&amp;rsquo;m still unsure what exactly the color has to do with it, although the idea of magical automatons powered by souls (Breaths, whatever) is neat, if not quite as original as Sanderson often is. (It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that I&amp;rsquo;m also reading Mistborn at the moment.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Final Empire</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/05/01/the-final-empire/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/05/01/the-final-empire/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Final Empire is a great read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love the worldbuilding. It&amp;rsquo;s a weird world, with strange nightly mists and a near constant fall of ash that gets on everything. Even stranger, it&amp;rsquo;s hinted that the world was once much more like our own. On top of that, you have a quasi-Feudal society ruled by a powerful, potentially immortal being. All of which leads to some pretty obvious seeds for some crazy stuff to go on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Elantris</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/04/elantris/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/04/elantris/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have yet to find a Sanderson novel that I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly like and Elantris is no exception.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, Elantris focuses around the titular city; once a place of wonder and magic which. Ten years ago, all that ended and now it&amp;rsquo;s populated by essentially zombies: those without heartbeats who cannot die and cannot heal. We follow a few different story lines&amp;ndash;a princess from another land engaged to the prince who gets Elantrisified in the very beginning of the story; an attempted religious coup from multiple fronts; and the politics of a kingdom/city trying to heal after massive upheaval.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Way of Kings</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/02/06/the-way-of-kings/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/02/06/the-way-of-kings/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
