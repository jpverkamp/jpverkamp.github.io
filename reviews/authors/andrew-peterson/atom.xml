&lt;p>If I were reading this book to my children, I imagine I would have liked it quite a bit more. It&amp;rsquo;s got the zany sort of weirdness that really appeals to children&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s in some ways much easier for them to jump from insane to imaginary, while at the same time not needing &lt;em>that&lt;/em> much of a reason for things to be like they are.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The entire prologue is like that. Prologue&lt;em>s&lt;/em>. There are 3 of them. And they&amp;rsquo;re all like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s amusing&amp;hellip; and then it&amp;rsquo;s too much.&lt;/p>
