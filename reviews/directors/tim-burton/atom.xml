I have just not watched many movies this year. I really should work on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s start with one of the weirdest and violent musicals out there: Sweeney Todd. I recently came across a YouTube video &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K-9Ekzc2A" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;How the Music Spoils Sweeney Todd (and why that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing)&lt;/a&gt; that reminded me how much I enjoyed the music when we did it in high school (Not even kidding, not sure how that got approved&amp;hellip;). So back we go to the 2007 Tim Burton / Johnny Depp version.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dark Shadows</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/05/22/dark-shadows/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 May 2012 04:55:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/05/22/dark-shadows/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Mostly, Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. I&amp;rsquo;ll go see just about anything involving either of them, even more quickly if it&amp;rsquo;s both. I went into the film not knowing much about the half-century old soap opera on which it was based, which I think hurt it in the end. There were a number of plot points that felt a bit rushed and didn&amp;rsquo;t need to be there (like the werewolf-daughter bit).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
