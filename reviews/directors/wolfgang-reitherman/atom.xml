I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to actually watch all of the Disney classic growing up (still haven&amp;rsquo;t), but I definiately watched this one. And now, after reading many of the stories to my children, it&amp;rsquo;s a delight to be able to share the video form with them as well!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really like the style of these stories. It&amp;rsquo;s a mix of animated world with the real storybook characters (Pooh et al), but also obviously in a book, as they hob from page to page. It&amp;rsquo;s not the story of style you&amp;rsquo;d always expect to work, but it really works here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>One Hundred and One Dalmatians</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/30/one-hundred-and-one-dalmatians/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/30/one-hundred-and-one-dalmatians/</guid><description>&lt;p>60 years ago. Dang. And you know? It holds up. The action is solid and story aren&amp;rsquo;t overly complicated but enjoyable, the animation really works (despite/because of the limitations of the time), and the villains are unambiguous and scary but not overly so. Perhaps best of all, it&amp;rsquo;s the story of an absolute pile of talking dogs. What&amp;rsquo;s not to love?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
