I think if you&amp;rsquo;re going to do the dog thing, I would strongly prefer {{crosslink &amp;ldquo;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&amp;rdquo;}}. Better music, decent story. Could be that I watched the latter far more.
But characterwise, I did enjoy the contrast between the titular Lady and the Tramp and it&amp;rsquo;s a nice enough story. Stylistically, I enjoy the city and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to not really see the human characters (it&amp;rsquo;s a dog movie after all.</description></item><item><title>Bambi</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/27/bambi/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/27/bambi/</guid><description>Bambi is a surprisingly tricky movie to review, mostly since it relies on who&amp;rsquo;s doing the reviewing. From my perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s cute enough, but there&amp;rsquo;s next to nothing there. It&amp;rsquo;s just a bunch of cute animated animals running around for an hour.

Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a fun enough movie for kids to watch, but I think next time they request it, I&amp;rsquo;ll find something else to do with my time.</description></item><item><title>One Hundred and One Dalmatians</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/30/one-hundred-and-one-dalmatians/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/30/one-hundred-and-one-dalmatians/</guid><description>&lt;p>60 years ago. Dang. And you know? It holds up. The action is solid and story aren&amp;rsquo;t overly complicated but enjoyable, the animation really works (despite/because of the limitations of the time), and the villains are unambiguous and scary but not overly so. Perhaps best of all, it&amp;rsquo;s the story of an absolute pile of talking dogs. What&amp;rsquo;s not to love?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
