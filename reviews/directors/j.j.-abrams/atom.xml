At least to me, The Rise of Skywalker did a pretty decent job of closing the loop on the saga that began a long time ago with the rise of Palpatine and the fall of Anakin Skywalker. Really, that&amp;rsquo;s the entire story, and you get that here in spades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were definitely some weird choices made in pacing (in particular, right at the beginning, they sort of drop the whole &amp;lsquo;Emperor is back&amp;rsquo; thing on us&amp;hellip; apparently the reveal came in &amp;hellip; Fortnite? Seriously?). We lose out on a lot of what could have been a cool story with Finn and Poe, although they&amp;rsquo;re still around at least. And I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine that losing Carrie Fisher did filming any favors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/04/star-wars-episode-vii-the-force-awakens/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/04/star-wars-episode-vii-the-force-awakens/</guid><description>&lt;p>Woo, new Star Wars! I remember the hype when The Force Awakens first came out. It was pretty crazy to see new Star Wars for the first time (second time?) in years. And it&amp;rsquo;s pretty dang cool. It&amp;rsquo;s shinier than the original trilogy, a bit less stuck in the weeds (trade blockades!) than the prequels, and it leans &lt;em>hard&lt;/em> on nostalgia. Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s Star Wars! Could they have done something newer and more unique? Sure they could have.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Trek Into Darkness</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/05/20/star-trek-into-darkness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2013 04:55:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/05/20/star-trek-into-darkness/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few years ago, I decided that I was doing myself a disservice as a self-identified geek&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>: of Star Trek, I&amp;rsquo;d only seen Voyager and a few of the movies. Of course I had to remedy that fact. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the course of a summer, I watched it all&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. 10 movies. 3 seasons of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star%20Trek:%20The%20Original%20Series">The Original Series&lt;/a>; 7 seasons each of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%20of%20Star%20Trek:%20The%20Next%20Generation%20episodes">The Next Generation&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%20of%20Star%20Trek:%20Deep%20Space%20Nine%20episodes">Deep Space Nine&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%20of%20Star%20Trek:%20Voyager%20episodes">Voyager&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>; and finally the 4 seasons of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star%20Trek:%20Enterprise">Enterprise&lt;/a>. Yet, I still don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself a Trekkie (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekie#Trekkie%20vs.%20Trekker">or a Trekker&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I guess my entire point is that I do have at least a bit of a leg to stand on when talking about the new Star Trek movies. That being said, feel free to ignore me. &amp;#x1f604; Everyone has their own opinion and I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly seen the entire spectrum when it comes to this movie&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
