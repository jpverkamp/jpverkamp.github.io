It&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of a truely delightful era&amp;ndash;that of the Disney animated classics. While they&amp;rsquo;ve certainly got their problems (the rather traditional gender roles and Disney&amp;rsquo;s ongoing copyright battles to name a pair), they&amp;rsquo;re still something elegant and innocent about them and Snow White is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bambi</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/27/bambi/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/27/bambi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Bambi is a surprisingly tricky movie to review, mostly since it relies on who&amp;rsquo;s doing the reviewing. From my perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s cute enough, but there&amp;rsquo;s next to nothing there. It&amp;rsquo;s just a bunch of cute animated animals running around for an hour. From my kids&amp;rsquo; perspectives though&amp;hellip; they loved it. They were laughing out loud at the cartoon antics and cuddled right in during the storm and hunt scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a fun enough movie for kids to watch, but I think next time they request it, I&amp;rsquo;ll find something else to do with my time. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
