&lt;p>(Side note: This also came back to mind since Ben Stiller wrote a good amount of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/severance/">Severance&lt;/a> of all things.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s a ridiculous and fun movie. The whole premise&amp;ndash;that a magical artifact somehow animates all the exhibits at the museum every night&amp;ndash;yet somehow no one has ever noticed this? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the list bit of sense. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it any less fun!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Easter Island Head: HEY!&lt;br>
[pauses]&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: Dum-dum.&lt;br>
Larry: Yes?&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: You give me gum-gum!&lt;br>
Larry: I give you gum-gum?&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: You new Dum-dum. You give me gum-gum.&lt;br>
Larry: Gee, okay, you know what? I have no gum-gum. Sorry. And my name isn&amp;rsquo;t Dum-dum. My name&amp;rsquo;s Larry.&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: No, your name Dum-dum.&lt;br>
[some people are running away]&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: Oh, you in trouble, Dum-dum. You better run-run. From Attila the Hun-hun.&lt;br>
[Attila yells and chases Larry]&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: See you later, Dum-dum!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There are a lot of fun action scenes in the movie. Just don&amp;rsquo;t think about it all too hard and enjoy the ride. I especially loved the chaos of the dioramas of thousands of tiny men come to life and fighting one another. ðŸ˜„&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Jedediah: No problemo, Gigantor.&lt;br>
Larry: Um, my name&amp;rsquo;s Larry, first of all okay, Jed? See, I call you Jed, I don&amp;rsquo;t call you tiny, right?&lt;br>
Jedediah: What&amp;rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&lt;br>
Larry: Hey teeny, how does that sound?&lt;br>
Jedediah: I&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t like it. It hurts my feelings.&lt;br>
Larry: Okay, well Gigantor makes me feel like some sort of freak.&lt;br>
Octavius: I don&amp;rsquo;t. I just call you Larry.&lt;br>
Larry: Don&amp;rsquo;t be a kiss-ass.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The casting in this movie is a big strength! Dick Van Dyke was a lot of fun as old former night watchman Cecil. Robin Williams (RIP :sad:) is always a delight and his Teddy Roosevelt was no exception. Rami Malek is certainly no &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/mr.-robot/">Mr. Robot&lt;/a>, but he&amp;rsquo;s got a perfect presence as Ahkmenrah. And Steve Coogan as Octavius and Owen Wilson&amp;rsquo;s Jedediah were hilarious (especially since the latter was originally a minor cameo).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And you know? Apparently &amp;lsquo;The real-life American Museum of Natural History had 20% more visitors during the holiday season following this movie&amp;rsquo;s opening.&amp;rsquo; So good on them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now the sequels? No idea where they go from here, but you know what? Worth a try!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/02/deadpool-wolverine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/02/deadpool-wolverine/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so here it is, (almost) the entire reason I rewatched &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/26/deadpool/">Deadpool&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/28/deadpool-2/">Deadpool 2&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much exactly what you get if you took the (crass) humor of Deadpool, jammed in as many cameos as you could, and shoved it into the modern &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/marvel-cinematic-universe/">MCU&lt;/a>, multiverse, TVA, and all&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Deadpool: Welcome to the MCU. You&amp;rsquo;re joining at a bit of a low point.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m still not &lt;em>actually&lt;/em> sure if that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Free Guy</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/07/free-guy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/07/free-guy/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Guy: I know this world is just a game, but this place, these people, that&amp;rsquo;s all I have. So I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna be the good guy. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be a great guy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Molotov Girl: [inhales] Wow, enjoy your lifetime supply of virginity.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds playing a guy named Guy in a game&amp;ndash;but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t realize it. It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a lot of fun. Once you get the basic idea, you&amp;rsquo;ve got pretty much the entire plot, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun and well done.&lt;/p>
