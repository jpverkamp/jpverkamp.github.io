&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oppenheimer: Albert? When I came to you with those calculations, we thought we might start a chain reaction that would destroy the entire world&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
Einstein: I remember it well. What of it?&lt;br&gt;
Oppenheimer: I believe we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a long, dense film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s complicated and there are &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; stretches with little going on by talking and setting. But&amp;hellip; man, is it thematic talking and setting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all about the story of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%20Robert%20Oppenheimer"&gt;J. Robert Oppenheimer&lt;/a&gt;, the so called &amp;lsquo;father of the atomic bomb&amp;rsquo; and&amp;hellip; well, how he earned that title. I knew bits and pieces of the story, but having watched this, bits and pieces were apparently all I knew. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of amazing how many of the names I recognize from physics classes were involved in either the project or Oppenheimer&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at times difficult to follow, there are a ton of jumps (mostly stylistically) and it makes me wander just how much of that was actually problems in Oppenheimer&amp;rsquo;s mind and how much was style. That&amp;rsquo;s not really clear, even by the end of the movie. I certainly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised though if he was having issues like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einstein: When they&amp;rsquo;ve punished you enough, they&amp;rsquo;ll serve you salmon and potato salad, make speeches, give you a medal, and pat you in the back telling all is forgiven. Just remember, it won&amp;rsquo;t be for you&amp;hellip; it would be for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the cast was another impressive part of this film. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t speak to just how perfectly accurate it was, but I think Cillian Murphy was an excellent casting for Oppenheimer. He&amp;rsquo;s got just the right amount of strange charisma to really pull you into the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr. were solid roles, enough to actually remind me why they&amp;rsquo;re considered solid actors&amp;ndash;and not just playing themselves as some do. Alden Ehrenreich I thought looked familiar, but had to look up where I&amp;rsquo;d seen him recently (Solo and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/02/17/beautiful-creatures/"&gt;Beautiful Creatures&lt;/a&gt; (that&amp;rsquo;s been a while)). There are just a bunch of people I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in other things before&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, quite the solid movie. I think I learned something and enjoyed the process of doing something, which is something always worth saying. It&amp;rsquo;s long, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth a watch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Personally, I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s any reason to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/11/barbie/"&gt;Barbenheimer&lt;/a&gt; it though, although it is amusing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oppenheimer: Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time he says it&amp;hellip; was surprising and kind of weird. I expect they were going with &amp;rsquo;everyone is waiting for him to say the line&amp;hellip; psyche!&amp;rsquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
