Take Agatha (and the general fallout of her created world) from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/19/wandavision/"&gt;WandaVision&lt;/a&gt;, turn up the witchiness, and go on a magical mystical, somewhat terrifying adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating story and, honestly, if you would have left out a few scenes it would have worked perfectly well completely outside of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well. And at this point, that&amp;rsquo;s a strong point in its favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man Kathryn Hawn does great in this. I loved the supporting witch cast, especially Aubrey Plaza. She does unsettling and off kilter so well. And Teen&amp;ndash;he was an interesting counterpoint. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about the worldbuilding around either Rio (Plaza) or Teen (Locke), those parts felt weird, but the actors were awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course&amp;hellip; &lt;strong&gt;the song&lt;/strong&gt; (I don&amp;rsquo;t see this version as spoilers, but some might).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man that song has been stuck in my head for weeks now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally would have dropped the last half of the last episode, the penultimate really works better as a conclusion. This really doesn&amp;rsquo;t need a sequel (although apparently there will be a third show as a &amp;lsquo;TV trilogy&amp;rsquo; sort of thing?), but so it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
