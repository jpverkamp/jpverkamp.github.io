&lt;p&gt;And then they made another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s not as bad as I remembered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison Jones isn&amp;rsquo;t getting younger&amp;hellip; but he still really makes Indiana Jones. Full stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet they were expecting this film (and especially Shia LeBeouf&amp;rsquo;s Mutt) to go better and possibly pass the torch. It was an echo of the same dynamic as Indy and his father in The Last Crusade. Just not quite done as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was kind of fun to see the Soviets be the bad guys this time around and it more or less fits this new, older Indy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dean Charles Stanforth: I barely recognize this country anymore. The government&amp;rsquo;s got us seeing Communists in our soup. When the hysteria reaches academia, I guess it&amp;rsquo;s time to call it a career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, seeing Karen Allen&amp;rsquo;s Marion Ravenwood again after all these years? And with the obvious fallout of that? That was more fun than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And man. Cate Blanchett act the heck out of that role. But still, she just wasn&amp;rsquo;t as much a villain as previous films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course&amp;ndash;the action scenes. A bit more over the top than previous movies? Do you even &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt; the roller coaster mine cart of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/indiana-jones-and-the-temple-of-doom/"&gt;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the opening in the warehouse. The nuclear bomb-fridge scene has been talked about to death. The motorcycle chase (through the library!) was a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indiana Jones: You want to be a good archaeologist&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
[Mutt drives them out of the building on his motorcycle]&lt;br&gt;
Indiana Jones: &amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;ve got to get out of the library!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jungle fight between the jeeps was pretty cool&amp;ndash;but the Tarzan bits? a bit much&amp;hellip; The temple was technically neat, even if it didn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense. And the &lt;span class="spoiler"&gt;alien&lt;/span&gt;
 finale wasn&amp;rsquo;t really that much weirder than centuries old knights and Nazi face melting artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think I&amp;rsquo;d place it above Temple of Doom, but below Raiders and the Last Crusade. A fun action flick and&amp;ndash;not as bad as I initially thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Jurassic Park (3D!)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/05/02/jurassic-park-3d/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2013 04:55:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/05/02/jurassic-park-3d/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually sure if I wanted to add this to my 2013 Movie Rankings, since really this isn&amp;rsquo;t a new movie for 2013. But in the end, it is a movie and I did see it, so it seems worthwhile to post about. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
