&lt;p&gt;It starts out strong with Jadoon on the Moon in &lt;a href="#1-smith-and-jones"&gt;Smith and Jones&lt;/a&gt;, we have more of the Face of Bo (&lt;a href="#3-gridlock"&gt;Gridlock&lt;/a&gt;) and the Daleks (&lt;a href="#4-daleks-in-manhattan"&gt;Daleks in Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;; plus, that one has Andrew Garfield!), several wonderfully creepy episodes (&lt;a href="#7-42"&gt;42&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="#9-the-family-of-blood"&gt;Family of Blood&lt;/a&gt;), and a finale that was certainly spectacular even if it finally veered too much &amp;lsquo;magic&amp;rsquo; and not enough science for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and of course this is the one with &lt;a href="#10-blink"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a reason this is the highest rated Doctor Who episode from the revival&amp;ndash;despite minimal time with the Doctor himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solid season. And now it&amp;rsquo;s time for Donna!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;</description></item><item><title>Doctor Who: Season 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/25/doctor-who-season-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/25/doctor-who-season-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m still re-watching Doctor Who in fits and starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, after all that was great with Eccleston/Nine in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/02/doctor-who-season-1/"&gt;season 1&lt;/a&gt;, how we get Tennant/Ten. Oh, I do enjoy his take on the doctor. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect mix of a whimsical seeing what he can get away with&amp;ndash;with the absolute feel of sadness and age that a being like the Doctor really should be feeling&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all with Rose along for the ride. Rose gets a lot of hate at times, but I really think she was a pretty good first nu-Who companion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this season, we a fair few two parters, a bunch of great episodes. &lt;a href="#4-the-girl-in-the-fireplace"&gt;The Girl in the Fireplace&lt;/a&gt; is a great take on &amp;rsquo;the Time Travelers wife&amp;rsquo; sort of thing. &lt;a href="#5-rise-of-the-cybermen"&gt;Rise of the Cybermen&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="#6-age-of-steel"&gt;Age of Steel&lt;/a&gt; introduces us to some old foes. &lt;a href="#8-the-impossible-planet"&gt;The Impossible Planet&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="#9-satan-pit"&gt;Satan Pit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; start getting into Doctor Who as sci-fi/horror (and I love it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="#10-love--monsters"&gt;Love &amp;amp; Monsters&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; actually not that bad? It&amp;rsquo;s definitely one of the &amp;lsquo;Doctor-lite&amp;rsquo; episodes, which are always something interesting to try. The ending is crass and kind of terrifying to really think about&amp;ndash;rather than the laughs you might think they were going for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a solid season!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="#special-the-runaway-bride"&gt;the special&lt;/a&gt; introduces Donna! Even if she won&amp;rsquo;t be back for a bit, she&amp;rsquo;s certainly a contender for my favorite companion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Doctor Who: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/02/doctor-who-season-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/02/doctor-who-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve watched through modern Doctor Who a few times, but it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually caught the 13th Doctor yet, let alone 14 and 15&amp;hellip; Now, with the new &amp;lsquo;reboot&amp;rsquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s about time to give it another go. And a good time to review them this time around!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I love this show. It&amp;rsquo;s wacky and cheap looking at times. Tonally, we&amp;rsquo;re all over the place, from farting aliens right up to the borders (if not more so) of horror with The Empty Child. Callbacks to the old show (which I still haven&amp;rsquo;t watched, one day) and all new friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do wish we&amp;rsquo;d gotten more of Eccelston, I forgot how much I liked his Doctor. But still, it&amp;rsquo;s good to have what we have!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
