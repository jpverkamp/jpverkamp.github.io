Man it&amp;rsquo;s been a weird few years. Which actually wraps up Black Widow pretty well.
On one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s a fairly solid action/spy movie. There are a number of spectacular action scenes, a deep dive into Black Widow&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s akin to an origin story, but filling in a character we already knew a decent amount of back rather than introducing someone new, which was nice&amp;ndash;and the introduction of a few new characters I expect we&amp;rsquo;ll see more of.</description></item><item><title>Thor: Ragnarok</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/16/thor-ragnarok/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/16/thor-ragnarok/</guid><description>Ooh, that poster. le kiss
Thor was &amp;hellip; fine, a weirdly downscale introduction to a kind of strange character early in the MCU. Thor: The Dark World went the other way, being too bigt and ambitious and suffering somewhat for it. So going into Thor: Ragnarok, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what we were going to get.
An absolute gem of an 80s sci fi/fantasy action superhero comedy that just works. Right from the very intro, you know it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a different sort of movie.</description></item><item><title>Godzilla vs Kong</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/22/godzilla-vs-kong/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 23:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/22/godzilla-vs-kong/</guid><description>You know, that was more enjoyable than I think it had any right to be. It&amp;rsquo;s the sort of movie that would have been far more spectacular on a big screen, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been to the theaters in a while, so I&amp;rsquo;ll take smaller.
All around, it&amp;rsquo;s a visual delight. Transporting Kong is hilarious looking. The Hollow Earth is an insane idea, but it&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful world and all of those big beasties to fight are a lot of fun to see.</description></item></channel></rss>
