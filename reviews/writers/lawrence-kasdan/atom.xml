I remember the hype when The Force Awakens first came out. It was pretty crazy to see new Star Wars for the first time (second time?) in years. And it&amp;rsquo;s pretty dang cool. It&amp;rsquo;s shinier than the original trilogy, a bit less stuck in the weeds (trade blockades!) than the prequels, and it leans hard on nostalgia. Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s Star Wars! Could they have done something newer and more unique?</description></item><item><title>Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/19/star-wars-episode-vi-return-of-the-jedi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/19/star-wars-episode-vi-return-of-the-jedi/</guid><description>&lt;p>You know, that is a really solid movie.

Big icy battles on land in and the sky/space around Hoth, training with a real (short) Jedi Master (and they&amp;rsquo;re all supposed to be dead), meetings between old friends&amp;ndash;who may not be too thrilled about losing in cards all those years ago&amp;ndash;another confrontation between Luke and Vadar, and the big bad reveal. Which&amp;hellip; seriously. His name is literally &lt;span class="spoiler">Dark Father&lt;/span>
