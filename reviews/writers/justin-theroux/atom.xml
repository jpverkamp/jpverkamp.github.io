The action is great, especially the fight scenes with the electro whips and between Iron Man and (not yet named) War Machine. Good stuff.
Characterwise, Don Cheadle is a great replacement as Rhodes; you can feel Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man at the top of his game (with nothing to lose because he&amp;rsquo;s dying); and I still think Paltrow makes a great Potts.</description></item></channel></rss>
