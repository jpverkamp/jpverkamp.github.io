The city had a great aesthetic. I loved the variety of cyborgs, many just trying to live their lives (in the background) or&amp;hellip; becoming ridiculously overdone weapons platforms. And I especially loved Motorball!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, Rosa Salazar as Alita really carried the show. I actually really enjoyed the oversized eyes (true to the manga apparently?) and her whole way of interacting with the world, the way she fights, the way she &lt;em>moves&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating combination of innocence and excellence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than that&amp;hellip; I wanted to like Christoph Walz&amp;rsquo;s Dr. Ido more than I did&amp;ndash;he&amp;rsquo;s generally a wonderful actor, but I feel he just didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to do. Likwise, Jennifer Connelly&amp;rsquo;s Chiren. I did enjoy Mahershala Alis&amp;rsquo; Vector and most of the evil cyborgs. They did a good job of evil/menacing!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise? Straight forward. And the ending&amp;hellip; really is asking for a sequel that so far as I know isn&amp;rsquo;t coming. It&amp;rsquo;d be neat! But you can&amp;rsquo;t just end a movie like that! Really leaves a poor taste on an otherwise quiet enjoyable movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
