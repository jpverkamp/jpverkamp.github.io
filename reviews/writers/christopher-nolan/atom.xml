It&amp;rsquo;s an absolutely bonkers plot. In a nutshell, the future is at war with the present (somehow) and there is technology that can &amp;lsquo;invert&amp;rsquo; people and things so that they experience time backwards. How exactly that works and what exactly happens when you mess with the past/future is&amp;hellip; never entirely clear. But it certainly does make for some absolutely crazy action scenes where some things are going forward, some backward, people are in the same scene more than once and&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Man of Steel</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/07/17/man-of-steel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2013 04:55:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/07/17/man-of-steel/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dang.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went to see Man of Steel mostly because I knew it&amp;rsquo;s on the way out of theaters. What I really want to see is Pacific Rim, but I feel like I have a few weeks for that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did. Man of Steel is well worth the price of admission and one of the few movies that is definitely worth seeing on a big screen. Just the sheer viseral impact of watching the Kryptonians toss each other into (and through) building after building, throwing about train engines as if they weighed nothing&amp;hellip; It felt a little surreal at times&amp;ndash;like that&amp;rsquo;s just *not *how momentum is supposed to work&amp;ndash;but I think that actually helped the illusion. Even more than with the Hulk or with Thor; these &lt;em>felt&lt;/em> like gods among men.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Dark Knight Rises</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/07/31/the-dark-knight-rises/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jul 2012 04:55:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/07/31/the-dark-knight-rises/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is another movie right up there with the Avengers in terms of anticipation and I have to say that it delivered. There&amp;rsquo;s just something about super hero movies that&amp;rsquo;s going particularly well right now. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how long this is going to last, but I&amp;rsquo;m more than happy to ride it while it does.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
