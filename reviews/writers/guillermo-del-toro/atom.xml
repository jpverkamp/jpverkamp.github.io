Fitting, since a year and change ago, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/18/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey/"&gt;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&lt;/a&gt; was my last film of 2012&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pacific Rim</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/07/19/pacific-rim/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2013 04:55:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/07/19/pacific-rim/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Pacific Rim is one heck of a movie. Just based on the trailers, we were promised giant robots, bigger monsters, rocket powered punches, and a ship turned sword. We got all of that and more in just over two hours of the best action movie I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in rather a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All together, the trailers (and the associated hype) were a lot to live up to. So how did it turn out?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/18/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Dec 2012 04:55:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/18/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I think the movie poster right over there is perhaps a perfect example of one my major gripes with the first new Hobbit movie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen dwarves, each with their one distinct beards (each of which reportedly cost as much as $10,000 to make) yet for the most part utterly interchangeable. The only ones of any real interest where Thorin (the leader), Balin (the old one), Bombur (the fat one), and to a lesser extent Bifur (the one with an axe on the mind). Other than that, who knows. Perhaps they&amp;rsquo;ll have more distinct roles in the other two movies, although I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
