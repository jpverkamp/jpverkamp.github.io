It doesn&amp;rsquo;t deal with the end of the world and only barely with the greater MCU (although there is a decent bit of &amp;lsquo;how the world changes with superheroes in it, like Ant-Man&amp;rsquo;s podcast and Avengercon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it is though? A awful lot of fun. Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan is just an absolute delight and really looks like she had a great time in the role. The whole supporting cast is great as well, especially Kamala&amp;rsquo;s family and friends Bruno and Nakia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamala Khan: [whispers] I&amp;rsquo;m a super hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[She runs off gleefully]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this. Especially when it leaned into the Muslim + Pakistani culture and the family dynamics of the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheikh Abdullah: I don’t need anyone on my side. I’m not even concerned if God is on my side as long as I am on His side. God is always right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agent Deever: I don’t have time for Quranic quotes. Excuse me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheikh Abdullah: Actually, that was Abraham Lincoln.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big fights and greater threats were kind of cheesey and didn&amp;rsquo;t mesh as well (especially the big showpiece in the final episode), but the down to earth human parts of being a teenager superhero? Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so hard to rank these any more, since there&amp;rsquo;s just so much to love in the MCU. I think Ms. Marvel ends up pretty squarely in the middle of the pack&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;d still say it&amp;rsquo;s worth a watch. Onward.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
