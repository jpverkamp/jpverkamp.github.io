&lt;p>In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much exactly what you get if you took the (crass) humor of Deadpool, jammed in as many cameos as you could, and shoved it into the modern &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/marvel-cinematic-universe/">MCU&lt;/a>, multiverse, TVA, and all&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Deadpool: Welcome to the MCU. You&amp;rsquo;re joining at a bit of a low point.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m still not &lt;em>actually&lt;/em> sure if that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-3/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Rocket: Someday I&amp;rsquo;m gonna make great machines that fly. And me and my friends are gonna go flying together, into the forever and beautiful sky.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that was fun. If you liked the previous two Guardians of the Galaxy entries (or especially the Holiday Special), I expect you&amp;rsquo;ll love this. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t care for them, there&amp;rsquo;s a chance!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh that was delightful. How did I not watch this sooner?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell: it&amp;rsquo;s a standard &amp;ldquo;save Christmas&amp;rdquo; plotline gone so &lt;em>very &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> alien. With Mantis and Drax having the main plotline to bring Peter Quill that one perfect gift is so fun. They&amp;rsquo;re just alien enough to bring more than a touch of chaos with them to Earth while at the same time human enough to relate to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, don&amp;rsquo;t expect anything deeper than the above. There really isn&amp;rsquo;t anything here you&amp;rsquo;d miss by not watching&amp;ndash;but on the other other hand it&amp;rsquo;s a quick watch and fun enough to be worth it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/21/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/21/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania/</guid><description>&lt;p>Upside: It&amp;rsquo;s visually super colorful and weird and it&amp;rsquo;s got a lot of potential for the new MCU Phase 5!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Downside: It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; weird and chaotic and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really fit with anything else we particularly know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; fine? I enjoyed watching it, but it&amp;rsquo;s in the category of MCU films that I doubt I&amp;rsquo;d watch again unless I&amp;rsquo;m doing a full rewatch (which is getting to be quite the endeavor).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wakanda Forever</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/wakanda-forever/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/wakanda-forever/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How?&lt;br>
How is never as important as why.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So. How do you fill the giant Chadwick Boseman shaped hole in the MCU?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently&amp;hellip; with funeral services, Atlantis (but not), mer-Hermes (the first self described mutant in the MCU), and&amp;ndash;eventually&amp;ndash;someone new to take up the mantle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; fine?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were certainly some pretty spectacular action scenes. The under water scenes are pretty&amp;ndash;even if they only sort of make sense. The character and costume design continues to impress. And there are giant piles of funeral services and mourning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, the sudden introduction of an entire (large) underwater civilization feels&amp;hellip; weird. And as we&amp;rsquo;ve had before with the Marvel movies, some of the big battle set pieces don&amp;rsquo;t make that much sense. They&amp;rsquo;re going out on a boat to fight water people. All to&amp;hellip; limit how many fighters they have to film? And then all but like ten people die and we&amp;rsquo;re just okay with that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s about the middle of the road so far as Marvel movies go for me. Pretty good, decent action, but there have been better entries. Pretty high up for 2023, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably more because I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen that many movies this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I Am Groot</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/28/i-am-groot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/28/i-am-groot/</guid><description>&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;re ~3 minute shorts (with 3+ minutes of credits each) about a young reincarnation of a tree-person who can&amp;rsquo;t talk, other than to say &amp;lsquo;I Am Groot&amp;rsquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I was expecting, but for what they are&amp;hellip; they&amp;rsquo;re cute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth the 15 minutes to watch them all. :D&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eternals</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/25/eternals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/25/eternals/</guid><description>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ancient aliens sent to Earth thousands of years ago to protect&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> humanity&amp;hellip; but only from very specific threats. Loki and the Chitauri? Nah. Hydra? Nope. Thanos? Of course not. A whole cast of superheroes&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and we&amp;rsquo;ve never seen them before&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&amp;ndash;and I doubt that any of the should-be-worldwide-news events in this film will make it into any of the others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you ignore all that though, it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting enough idea, especially once you start digging into the greater cosmic plot. There&amp;rsquo;s even more to unpack than we even get a chance to look at in that movie. I really do want to know where it goes next&amp;ndash;and if there will be any impact at all on the greater MCU.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Man: Homecoming</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/29/spider-man-homecoming/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/29/spider-man-homecoming/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>That&lt;/em> is a truly delightful Spider-Man movie. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird seeing him introduced &lt;em>after&lt;/em> the events of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/03/captain-america-civil-war/">Captain America: Civil War&lt;/a>) and completely skipping how he became Spider-Man in the first place&amp;hellip; but it works. I really like the entire plot, dealing with the fallout of the Avengers / super-hero activity and how normal people try to live their lives around it&amp;ndash;and what happens when the powers that be step in and take that away from them. Excellent villain fuel. It&amp;rsquo;s a little silly that &lt;span class="spoiler">the Vulture ends up being Spider-Man's crush's father...&lt;/span>
, but I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s the sort of thing you expect from superhero films. Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s a solid, fun action film.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Avengers: Endgame</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/29/avengers-endgame/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/29/avengers-endgame/</guid><description>&lt;p>Wow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s one heck of a climax.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/19/avengers-infinity-war/">Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/a>, Thanos won. He snapped and half of the universe died&amp;ndash;let&amp;rsquo;s ignore the logistics of that. In Endgame, there&amp;rsquo;s a chance&amp;ndash;a very small chance&amp;ndash;that they can fix it all. All they need is a little &amp;ndash;&lt;/p>

Ten years. 18 movies. Dozens of huge name actors and crossovers, all leading to this. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/04/the-avengers/">The Avengers&lt;/a> gave us a team up, but Infinity War turned it all up to 11. The battle scenes are insane (especially that final battle in Wakanda, especially especially the return of Thor), the villain&amp;ndash;Josh Brolin as Thanos&amp;ndash;is powerful and &lt;span class="spoiler">ACTUALLY GETS A CHANCE TO WIN&lt;/span>
, and I absolutely love seeing the interplay between all of the characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Black Panther</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/18/black-panther/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/18/black-panther/</guid><description>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a very solid movie. The casting is top notch, the style is wonderfully afrofuturistic, and the plot/motivation is interesting enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Starting with the plot/motivation, I think that the choice to have Wakanda separated from the rest of the world, all through centuries of slavery and inequality is certainly an interesting one. And I&amp;rsquo;m not at all alone.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/28/thor/">Thor&lt;/a> was &amp;hellip; fine, a weirdly downscale introduction to a kind of strange character early in the MCU. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/12/thor-the-dark-world/">Thor: The Dark World&lt;/a> went the other way, being too bigt and ambitious and suffering somewhat for it. So going into Thor: Ragnarok, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what we were going to get.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An absolute gem of an 80s sci fi/fantasy action superhero comedy that just works. Right from the very intro, you know it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a different sort of movie. They lean hard into the Norse/Asgardian mythos, with Thor in the underworld, chained up (but not concerned) by a giant flaming skeleton who&amp;rsquo;s supposed to signify the end of days. One spectacular Thor&amp;rsquo;ful action scene later and we&amp;rsquo;re back on Asgard, dealing with the missing Odin. Then we&amp;rsquo;re off to Earth, only to bump into Doctor Strange, now fully into his powers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/13/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/13/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>After the surprisingly awesome &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/13/guardians-of-the-galaxy/">Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/a>, it was really a question of: could they do it again? The answer, a resounding&amp;hellip; sort of?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has some pretty awesome moments. The opening battle in particular is spectacular (I love the contrast of dancing Baby Groot against a big smack down in the background). And we get all piles of additional humor based around Drax&amp;rsquo;s literalness, Rocket being a racoon, &amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Captain America: Civil War</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/03/captain-america-civil-war/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/03/captain-america-civil-war/</guid><description>&lt;p>Captain America: Civil War isn&amp;rsquo;t really a Captain America movie. While it deals with the Winter Solder to some extent, as much as that it&amp;rsquo;s an Iron Man movie since &lt;span class="spoiler">he killed Stark's parents...&lt;/span>
. But really, it&amp;rsquo;s an Avengers movie. Everyone shows up, takes sides, and eventually ends up a great big superhero fight. And It&amp;hellip; Is&amp;hellip; Spectacular. In my opinion, it&amp;rsquo;s the best MCU movie to this point, beating out any of the solo outings and even the first two Avengers movies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ant-Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/02/ant-man/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/02/ant-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>Continuing in the set of Marvel movies that came out after I stopped going to theaters quite so much / reviewing movies in 2014, we have Ant-Man!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s a heist movie/comedy with superheroes!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful movie, with a lighter, funnier theme than a lot of the movies. The cast is wonderful. Paul Rudd is hilarious and well cast as Ant-Man, Michael Douglas is a wonderful cranky old man scientist that&amp;rsquo;s been burned as Hank Pym, Corey Stoll is a wonderful crazy (spoilers) bad guy, and Evangeline Lilly is criminally underused. Eventually that will/should get better. But the real standout has to be Michael Peña as Luis. He&amp;rsquo;s hilarious. The &amp;lsquo;he said/she said&amp;rsquo; stories told with all manner of different actors but his voice are a joy to watch. He&amp;rsquo;s just that funny.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Avengers: Age of Ultron</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/14/avengers-age-of-ultron/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/14/avengers-age-of-ultron/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Hawkeye: The city is flying and we&amp;rsquo;re fighting an army of robots. And I have a bow and arrow. Nothing makes sense.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Age of Ultron is an odd movie. From the perspective of a summer blockbuster/action movie, it&amp;rsquo;s solid. The opening action scene is wonderfully avengerful, there are all manner of awesome fights (the Hulk versus Iron Man fight and the final battle come to mind), and we get a few new characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/27/captain-america-the-winter-soldier/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/27/captain-america-the-winter-soldier/</guid><description>&lt;p>From &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/12/thor-the-dark-world/">one of the weakest&lt;/a> MCU movies to one of the strongest. I loved the first solo entry of Captain American and the second is even better. Much like &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/27/captain-america-the-winter-soldier/">last time&lt;/a>, I very much enjoyed this movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a solid contrast against the first Captain America (blind optimistic patriotism versus a darker world, where even your friends&amp;hellip; might not be). It&amp;rsquo;s made all the better having already seen the future of Sam and Bucky/The Winter Soldier now. Last time through, I was hoping they could pull off all the new characters and now&amp;hellip; I think they did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around (and so far), the top of my list for the year. An excellent movie.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Out of all the pre-Avengers / &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films#Phase_One:_Avengers_Assembled">Phase One&lt;/a> Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, it&amp;rsquo;s really a toss up whether Iron Man or Captain American was my favorite. In &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films#Phase_Two">Phase Two&lt;/a>? It&amp;rsquo;s not even a question&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.

How in the world do you have a man in a suit, a literal &amp;lsquo;god&amp;rsquo;, a rage monster, a super soldier, and a couple &amp;hellip; regular people ever interact on the same scale? For the most part, it&amp;rsquo;s hand waved away. Everyone is paired up with an opponent of roughly the same power level and we move on with our lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No where those is this contrast more apparent than in the Universe of Thor. The people of Asgard are supposed to be gods. They live thousands of years. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen them shrug off some pretty crazy weapons. And yet here they are, dying to spears and falling rocks. It just doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean, there are any number of brilliant CGI shots of the weird world of Asgard, and it at least has a much bigger scope than the first Thor, but it still feels &amp;hellip; hollow. It&amp;rsquo;s a pity, because I enjoy Thor&amp;rsquo;s super powerful fish out of water story well enough in the combined movies, but this is not my favorite of the combined films.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s always interesting to re-read my older reviews: &lt;a href="#original-2013-review">see below&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The first Thor was a bit disappointing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There, I said it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It could certainly have been worse, but it really felt like the entire movie served solely to set up Thor&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> for the Avengers.

&lt;p>On one hand, I really do still think they absolutely nailed Robert Downey Jr. as Iron man. He can do both funny and broken pretty well and has more than a few chances for each this time around. I know now (and didn&amp;rsquo;t then) that there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be an Iron Man 4, but he still did an amazing job in this last solo outing and in the teams ups yet to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise, I actually really liked Gwyneth Paltrow&amp;rsquo;s as Pepper Potts. It&amp;rsquo;s good seeing her as both a foil for Iron Man and actually being a badass in her own right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ben Kingsley still steal the show, although this time around I&amp;rsquo;m coming to see just how much range there was in Guy Pearce&amp;rsquo;s Aldrich Killian. He pulled down on his luck geek up through brilliant and crazy mirror to Tony Stark all the way to &lt;span class="spoiler">fire breathing baddie&lt;/span>
 pretty darn well so far as action movies go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One that I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention last time around, but made all the more apparent I think having just seen in her in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/22/godzilla-vs-kong/">Godzilla vs Kong&lt;/a>) was Rebecca Hall&amp;rsquo;s performance as Maya Hansen. She does smart conflicted scientist very well in both films.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, it was a fascinating way to deal with PTSD, even if does feel a bit sudden (although PTSD can do that) and could really have used a bit deeper dive (not really room for that in a summer blockbuster).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than that, feel free to give my &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/05/iron-man-3/">previous review&lt;/a> a look. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really changed my opinion much, but it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see the two 8 years apart. A lot can change in 8 years&amp;hellip; Both so far as the MCU and in my own life. Some things change, some things stand the tests of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think this time around, I&amp;rsquo;ll slot it in just below the Avengers on both lists. I think Iron Man 3 might actually be the better movie in a lot of ways, but the Avengers I think wins just on sheer spectacle. Feel free to disagree. :) It&amp;rsquo;s all made up numbers anyways.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For anyone that&amp;rsquo;s somehow missed it, Captain America is the story about how a little guy from Brooklyn with a heart of gold and a steadfast determination to serve his country in World War II gets just that chance: taking a super soldier serum to get buff, becomes a showgirl for a while (because of course), fights Nazis, and gets frozen in the ice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thor</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/28/thor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Mar 2021 23:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/28/thor/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thor is an odd sort of movie for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe&lt;/a>. On one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s our first foray into the more &amp;lsquo;magical&amp;rsquo; side of the universe, with ancient Gods and the like. Although in this universe, we&amp;rsquo;re led to believe that it&amp;rsquo;s really just highly advanced science. On the other hand, despite a worlds spanning plot (literally, 3 of them), it still feels oddly &amp;hellip; small.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s weird. We&amp;rsquo;re supposed to believe that Odin is over a thousand years old and Thor is&amp;hellip; just now coming into his kingship now? How long does it take for them to grow up? And Asgardians at some level can die in battle, but in others handle getting thrown around and hit by cars just fine? It&amp;rsquo;s just&amp;hellip; a little weird. The idea of Thor being a spoiled young man and having to show his worthiness is a solid enough plot (and a common enough Thor origin story); although it all comes together a mite quickly for him. And then the final battle&amp;ndash;while it looks cool enough I guess, it&amp;rsquo;s all feels like they could have used a bit more time and money to fill things in a bit more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Iron Man 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/23/iron-man-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/23/iron-man-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>I vaguely remember Iron Man 2 being a much weaker movie than the first Iron Man, but you know, it&amp;rsquo;s actually really good. The action is great, especially the fight scenes with the electro whips and between Iron Man and (not yet named) War Machine. Good stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, Don Cheadle is a great replacement as Rhodes; you can feel Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man at the top of his game (with nothing to lose &lt;spoiler>because he&amp;rsquo;s dying&lt;/spoiler>); and I still think Paltrow makes a great Potts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Incredible Hulk</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/20/the-incredible-hulk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Mar 2021 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/20/the-incredible-hulk/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of bummer that The Incredible Hulk is stuck in sort of a legal loophole and isn&amp;rsquo;t available with all the rest of the MCU on Disney+ (A̸̜̓L̶̬̽L̷̗̋ ̵̦̂Ĥ̴̖A̵͓͋I̴̝̓L̵̺̓ ̶͖̄T̶̿͜H̶̬̊È̷̡ ̸̜̋M̸̮̔O̷̜͒U̶͇̓S̵̺̏Ë̵̝́). On top of that, it&amp;rsquo;s the only main MCU superhero that they&amp;rsquo;ve recast (so far). Conversely though, it&amp;rsquo;s actually (surprisingly) a good movie.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Iron Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/03/iron-man/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/03/iron-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>Way back in 2008, I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone had the slightest idea how far the Marvel Cinematic Universe would go. Taking a less well known superhero (face it, before this few knew who Iron Man was), attaching him to a talented but troubled actor (Robert Downy Jr was an amazing cast) and make a fairly stock standard action movie and&amp;hellip; build a media empire that would span more than 12 years and 20 films (so far&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>X-Men: Days of Future Past</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/06/08/x-men-days-of-future-past/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/06/08/x-men-days-of-future-past/</guid><description>&lt;p>After the awesome first two films, the relative failures of The Last Stand and the Wolverine(s), and the return to form of First Class, I was cautiously hopeful for Days of Future Past. It had potential&amp;ndash;near full casts of both sets of X-Men?&amp;ndash;but potential doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean good.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
