&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Then why did you touch it?&lt;br>
Because it was glowing and mysterious.&lt;br>
Okay new rule - No touching shit&lt;br>
I’m getting a lot of negative energy from you and I don’t need that right now.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Chaos ensues and bad decisions mean that the Marvels (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/23/ms.-marvel/">Ms. Marvel&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/28/captain-marvel/">Captain Marvel&lt;/a>, and&amp;hellip; the other one? (Monica Rambeau, most recently from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/19/wandavision/">WandaVision&lt;/a>)) are now suddenly swapping places across time and space. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>really&lt;/em> make any sense, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun to watch!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then&amp;hellip; the whole thing starts going off the rails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why don&amp;rsquo;t they have help? Why does Ms. Marvel even wear that bangle?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And&amp;hellip; seriously? A planet where they &lt;em>sing&lt;/em> instead of speak and can&amp;rsquo;t understand if you don&amp;rsquo;t sing? That&amp;rsquo;s a comics silly reason; it just feels weird on the big screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And what in the &lt;em>world&lt;/em> is with those Flerken scenes&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s already the shortest movie in the MCU. Did they just really not have enough content so they had to pad it with &lt;em>something&lt;/em>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it was almost there, but like much of the MCU for&amp;hellip; a while now. It could have been so much better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
