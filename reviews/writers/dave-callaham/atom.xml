It takes a character I&amp;rsquo;ve at least barely heard of1 with a cast pretty much unknown to the western world2 and turns it into a wonderful combination of human drama, Lovecraftian baddies, and awesome action scenes. It&amp;rsquo;s well among my favorite MCU movies to date (only Captain America beats it out among introductions and a few others overall) and well worth the watch. After how big the MCU has gotten recently, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of nice to see a movie that almost completely stands on it&amp;rsquo;s own3.</description></item><item><title>Mortal Kombat</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/03/mortal-kombat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 23:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/03/mortal-kombat/</guid><description>Shang Tsung: FINISH THEM!
Mortal Kombat is an odd sort of movie. With 2 dozen games, 2 previous live action and 2 animated films, and all manner of other references and media, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of backstory going on. But really, it all comes down to some sort of otherworldly nasties coming to conquer the Earth, but they can only do so if they defeat Earth&amp;rsquo;s champion(s). Other than that, it&amp;rsquo;s really a vehicle for hand to hand combat of the most violent sort.</description></item></channel></rss>
