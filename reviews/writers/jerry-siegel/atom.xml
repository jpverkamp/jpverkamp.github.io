&lt;p>I went to see Man of Steel mostly because I knew it&amp;rsquo;s on the way out of theaters. What I really want to see is Pacific Rim, but I feel like I have a few weeks for that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did. Man of Steel is well worth the price of admission and one of the few movies that is definitely worth seeing on a big screen. Just the sheer viseral impact of watching the Kryptonians toss each other into (and through) building after building, throwing about train engines as if they weighed nothing&amp;hellip; It felt a little surreal at times&amp;ndash;like that&amp;rsquo;s just *not *how momentum is supposed to work&amp;ndash;but I think that actually helped the illusion. Even more than with the Hulk or with Thor; these &lt;em>felt&lt;/em> like gods among men.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
