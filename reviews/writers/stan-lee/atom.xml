&lt;p>Rocket: Someday I&amp;rsquo;m gonna make great machines that fly. And me and my friends are gonna go flying together, into the forever and beautiful sky.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that was fun. If you liked the previous two Guardians of the Galaxy entries (or especially the Holiday Special), I expect you&amp;rsquo;ll love this. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t care for them, there&amp;rsquo;s a chance!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh that was delightful. How did I not watch this sooner?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell: it&amp;rsquo;s a standard &amp;ldquo;save Christmas&amp;rdquo; plotline gone so &lt;em>very &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> alien. With Mantis and Drax having the main plotline to bring Peter Quill that one perfect gift is so fun. They&amp;rsquo;re just alien enough to bring more than a touch of chaos with them to Earth while at the same time human enough to relate to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, don&amp;rsquo;t expect anything deeper than the above. There really isn&amp;rsquo;t anything here you&amp;rsquo;d miss by not watching&amp;ndash;but on the other other hand it&amp;rsquo;s a quick watch and fun enough to be worth it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/21/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/21/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania/</guid><description>&lt;p>Upside: It&amp;rsquo;s visually super colorful and weird and it&amp;rsquo;s got a lot of potential for the new MCU Phase 5!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Downside: It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; weird and chaotic and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really fit with anything else we particularly know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; fine? I enjoyed watching it, but it&amp;rsquo;s in the category of MCU films that I doubt I&amp;rsquo;d watch again unless I&amp;rsquo;m doing a full rewatch (which is getting to be quite the endeavor).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wakanda Forever</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/wakanda-forever/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/wakanda-forever/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How?&lt;br>
How is never as important as why.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So. How do you fill the giant Chadwick Boseman shaped hole in the MCU?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently&amp;hellip; with funeral services, Atlantis (but not), mer-Hermes (the first self described mutant in the MCU), and&amp;ndash;eventually&amp;ndash;someone new to take up the mantle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; fine?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were certainly some pretty spectacular action scenes. The under water scenes are pretty&amp;ndash;even if they only sort of make sense. The character and costume design continues to impress. And there are giant piles of funeral services and mourning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, the sudden introduction of an entire (large) underwater civilization feels&amp;hellip; weird. And as we&amp;rsquo;ve had before with the Marvel movies, some of the big battle set pieces don&amp;rsquo;t make that much sense. They&amp;rsquo;re going out on a boat to fight water people. All to&amp;hellip; limit how many fighters they have to film? And then all but like ten people die and we&amp;rsquo;re just okay with that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s about the middle of the road so far as Marvel movies go for me. Pretty good, decent action, but there have been better entries. Pretty high up for 2023, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably more because I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen that many movies this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I Am Groot</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/28/i-am-groot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/28/i-am-groot/</guid><description>&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;re ~3 minute shorts (with 3+ minutes of credits each) about a young reincarnation of a tree-person who can&amp;rsquo;t talk, other than to say &amp;lsquo;I Am Groot&amp;rsquo;.

&lt;p>Worth the 15 minutes to watch them all. :D&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thor: Love and Thunder</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/31/thor-love-and-thunder/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/31/thor-love-and-thunder/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/28/thor/">Thor&lt;/a> was probably the most underwhelming of Phase 1, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/12/thor-the-dark-world/">Thor: The Dark World&lt;/a> tried to go more fantasy and was mostly forgettable, and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/16/thor-ragnarok/">Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/a> was a blast. Getting better all the time, so &amp;hellip; what about &lt;em>Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good question. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to love about the movie: Hemsworth&amp;rsquo;s sense of humor, Portman back and then some, Thompson&amp;rsquo;s awesome and slightly awkward Valkyrie. And of course Bale plays a solidly terrifying baddy in Gorr.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, there is a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of movie to get through here, probably more than a bit too much. A cancer plot, succession jealousy, a threat spanning across the Galaxy (or at least the gods thereof)&amp;ndash;heck, the idea that gods are just &lt;em>a thing&lt;/em> now, Thor unpacking even more trauma. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot to put into a single movie and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>quite&lt;/em> work. It&amp;rsquo;s still a solid enough flick, but not nearly up to what &lt;em>Ragnarok&lt;/em> did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, pretty impressive for the first 4th solo outing in the MCU. Because that&amp;rsquo;s a thing we can say now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/29/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/29/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness/</guid><description>&lt;p>So. That&amp;rsquo;s what what you get if you take a &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/directors/sam-raimi">director best known for his horror movies&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and let them loose in the MCU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like it. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Man: No Way Home</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/18/spider-man-no-way-home/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/18/spider-man-no-way-home/</guid><description>&lt;p>Finally got around to watching this. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did, it&amp;rsquo;s hilarious and an aboslute blast of nostalgia. Similar to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/29/avengers-endgame/">Avengers: Endgame&lt;/a>, I don&amp;rsquo;t know know if this would possibly hold up without the weight of all of the movies that came before it (I doubt it), but with that weight&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s really really good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s funny, it&amp;rsquo;s touching, and there are some really crazy action scenes. But the greatest strength of course comes from &lt;span class="spoiler">bringing back a half dozen villains and all three modern live action Spider-Men into one film&lt;/span>
. Would anyone have believed something that crazy possible, especially before Infinity War/Endgame? I doubt it. But it&amp;rsquo;s quite satisfying.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Man: Far From Home</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/30/spider-man-far-from-home/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/30/spider-man-far-from-home/</guid><description>&lt;p>As much as I loved &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/29/spider-man-homecoming/">Spider-Man: Homecoming&lt;/a>, Spider-Man: Far From Home takes what made it great and turns it up a few levels &lt;em>even further&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One one level, you have Spider-Man being Spider-Man. He&amp;rsquo;s a good kid, trying to make his way in life, trying to deal with the dual life of being a highschooler and being a superhero&amp;ndash;of saving the world and perhaps getting the girl.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then you layer all the weight of the greater MCU on top of it. This takes place just after &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/29/avengers-endgame/">Avengers: Endgame&lt;/a>. So you have the fallout of Iron Man (Spider-Man&amp;rsquo;s mentor/Uncle Ben figure) being gone and Spider-Man having to step into &lt;em>those&lt;/em> shoes, the first big mention of The Blip&amp;ndash;and how you deal with coming back and the world has changed, and all sorts of dealing with a Nick Fury who&amp;rsquo;s lost several of his heaviest hitters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Man: Homecoming</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/29/spider-man-homecoming/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/29/spider-man-homecoming/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>That&lt;/em> is a truly delightful Spider-Man movie. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird seeing him introduced &lt;em>after&lt;/em> the events of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/03/captain-america-civil-war/">Captain America: Civil War&lt;/a>) and completely skipping how he became Spider-Man in the first place&amp;hellip; but it works. I really like the entire plot, dealing with the fallout of the Avengers / super-hero activity and how normal people try to live their lives around it&amp;ndash;and what happens when the powers that be step in and take that away from them. Excellent villain fuel. It&amp;rsquo;s a little silly that &lt;span class="spoiler">the Vulture ends up being Spider-Man's crush's father...&lt;/span>
, but I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s the sort of thing you expect from superhero films. Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s a solid, fun action film.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Avengers: Endgame</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/29/avengers-endgame/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/29/avengers-endgame/</guid><description>&lt;p>Wow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s one heck of a climax.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/19/avengers-infinity-war/">Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/a>, Thanos won. He snapped and half of the universe died&amp;ndash;let&amp;rsquo;s ignore the logistics of that. In Endgame, there&amp;rsquo;s a chance&amp;ndash;a very small chance&amp;ndash;that they can fix it all. All they need is a little &amp;ndash;&lt;/p>

Ten years. 18 movies. Dozens of huge name actors and crossovers, all leading to this. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/04/the-avengers/">The Avengers&lt;/a> gave us a team up, but Infinity War turned it all up to 11. The battle scenes are insane (especially that final battle in Wakanda, especially especially the return of Thor), the villain&amp;ndash;Josh Brolin as Thanos&amp;ndash;is powerful and &lt;span class="spoiler">ACTUALLY GETS A CHANCE TO WIN&lt;/span>
, and I absolutely love seeing the interplay between all of the characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Black Panther</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/18/black-panther/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/18/black-panther/</guid><description>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a very solid movie. The casting is top notch, the style is wonderfully afrofuturistic, and the plot/motivation is interesting enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Starting with the plot/motivation, I think that the choice to have Wakanda separated from the rest of the world, all through centuries of slavery and inequality is certainly an interesting one. And I&amp;rsquo;m not at all alone.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/28/thor/">Thor&lt;/a> was &amp;hellip; fine, a weirdly downscale introduction to a kind of strange character early in the MCU. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/12/thor-the-dark-world/">Thor: The Dark World&lt;/a> went the other way, being too bigt and ambitious and suffering somewhat for it. So going into Thor: Ragnarok, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what we were going to get.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An absolute gem of an 80s sci fi/fantasy action superhero comedy that just works. Right from the very intro, you know it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a different sort of movie. They lean hard into the Norse/Asgardian mythos, with Thor in the underworld, chained up (but not concerned) by a giant flaming skeleton who&amp;rsquo;s supposed to signify the end of days. One spectacular Thor&amp;rsquo;ful action scene later and we&amp;rsquo;re back on Asgard, dealing with the missing Odin. Then we&amp;rsquo;re off to Earth, only to bump into Doctor Strange, now fully into his powers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/13/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/13/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>After the surprisingly awesome &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/13/guardians-of-the-galaxy/">Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/a>, it was really a question of: could they do it again? The answer, a resounding&amp;hellip; sort of?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has some pretty awesome moments. The opening battle in particular is spectacular (I love the contrast of dancing Baby Groot against a big smack down in the background). And we get all piles of additional humor based around Drax&amp;rsquo;s literalness, Rocket being a racoon, &amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doctor Strange</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/10/doctor-strange/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/10/doctor-strange/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Wong: While heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers, we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Man, that is a visually stunning movie. The first battle with building magically twisting all over (a la Inception), the glowing magic rings, the magical doodads. I am ever thankful that superhero movies have gotten popular enough that studios will spend the big bucks on special effects. They really do look great.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ant-Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/02/ant-man/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/02/ant-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>Continuing in the set of Marvel movies that came out after I stopped going to theaters quite so much / reviewing movies in 2014, we have Ant-Man!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s a heist movie/comedy with superheroes!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful movie, with a lighter, funnier theme than a lot of the movies. The cast is wonderful. Paul Rudd is hilarious and well cast as Ant-Man, Michael Douglas is a wonderful cranky old man scientist that&amp;rsquo;s been burned as Hank Pym, Corey Stoll is a wonderful crazy (spoilers) bad guy, and Evangeline Lilly is criminally underused. Eventually that will/should get better. But the real standout has to be Michael Peña as Luis. He&amp;rsquo;s hilarious. The &amp;lsquo;he said/she said&amp;rsquo; stories told with all manner of different actors but his voice are a joy to watch. He&amp;rsquo;s just that funny.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Avengers: Age of Ultron</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/14/avengers-age-of-ultron/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/14/avengers-age-of-ultron/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Hawkeye: The city is flying and we&amp;rsquo;re fighting an army of robots. And I have a bow and arrow. Nothing makes sense.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Age of Ultron is an odd movie. From the perspective of a summer blockbuster/action movie, it&amp;rsquo;s solid. The opening action scene is wonderfully avengerful, there are all manner of awesome fights (the Hulk versus Iron Man fight and the final battle come to mind), and we get a few new characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thor: The Dark World</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/12/thor-the-dark-world/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/12/thor-the-dark-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>One problem that comic book universes in general and the MCU in specific have always had is that of scale. How in the world do you have a man in a suit, a literal &amp;lsquo;god&amp;rsquo;, a rage monster, a super soldier, and a couple &amp;hellip; regular people ever interact on the same scale? For the most part, it&amp;rsquo;s hand waved away. Everyone is paired up with an opponent of roughly the same power level and we move on with our lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No where those is this contrast more apparent than in the Universe of Thor. The people of Asgard are supposed to be gods. They live thousands of years. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen them shrug off some pretty crazy weapons. And yet here they are, dying to spears and falling rocks. It just doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean, there are any number of brilliant CGI shots of the weird world of Asgard, and it at least has a much bigger scope than the first Thor, but it still feels &amp;hellip; hollow. It&amp;rsquo;s a pity, because I enjoy Thor&amp;rsquo;s super powerful fish out of water story well enough in the combined movies, but this is not my favorite of the combined films.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s always interesting to re-read my older reviews: &lt;a href="#original-2013-review">see below&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On one hand, I really do still think they absolutely nailed Robert Downey Jr. as Iron man. He can do both funny and broken pretty well and has more than a few chances for each this time around. I know now (and didn&amp;rsquo;t then) that there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be an Iron Man 4, but he still did an amazing job in this last solo outing and in the teams ups yet to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise, I actually really liked Gwyneth Paltrow&amp;rsquo;s as Pepper Potts. It&amp;rsquo;s good seeing her as both a foil for Iron Man and actually being a badass in her own right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ben Kingsley still steal the show, although this time around I&amp;rsquo;m coming to see just how much range there was in Guy Pearce&amp;rsquo;s Aldrich Killian. He pulled down on his luck geek up through brilliant and crazy mirror to Tony Stark all the way to &lt;span class="spoiler">fire breathing baddie&lt;/span>
 pretty darn well so far as action movies go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One that I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention last time around, but made all the more apparent I think having just seen in her in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/22/godzilla-vs-kong/">Godzilla vs Kong&lt;/a>) was Rebecca Hall&amp;rsquo;s performance as Maya Hansen. She does smart conflicted scientist very well in both films.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, it was a fascinating way to deal with PTSD, even if does feel a bit sudden (although PTSD can do that) and could really have used a bit deeper dive (not really room for that in a summer blockbuster).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than that, feel free to give my &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/05/iron-man-3/">previous review&lt;/a> a look. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really changed my opinion much, but it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see the two 8 years apart. A lot can change in 8 years&amp;hellip; Both so far as the MCU and in my own life. Some things change, some things stand the tests of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think this time around, I&amp;rsquo;ll slot it in just below the Avengers on both lists. I think Iron Man 3 might actually be the better movie in a lot of ways, but the Avengers I think wins just on sheer spectacle. Feel free to disagree. :) It&amp;rsquo;s all made up numbers anyways.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Go see Iron Man 3. I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thor</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/28/thor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Mar 2021 23:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/28/thor/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thor is an odd sort of movie for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe&lt;/a>. On one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s our first foray into the more &amp;lsquo;magical&amp;rsquo; side of the universe, with ancient Gods and the like. Although in this universe, we&amp;rsquo;re led to believe that it&amp;rsquo;s really just highly advanced science. On the other hand, despite a worlds spanning plot (literally, 3 of them), it still feels oddly &amp;hellip; small.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s weird. We&amp;rsquo;re supposed to believe that Odin is over a thousand years old and Thor is&amp;hellip; just now coming into his kingship now? How long does it take for them to grow up? And Asgardians at some level can die in battle, but in others handle getting thrown around and hit by cars just fine? It&amp;rsquo;s just&amp;hellip; a little weird. The idea of Thor being a spoiled young man and having to show his worthiness is a solid enough plot (and a common enough Thor origin story); although it all comes together a mite quickly for him. And then the final battle&amp;ndash;while it looks cool enough I guess, it&amp;rsquo;s all feels like they could have used a bit more time and money to fill things in a bit more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Iron Man 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/23/iron-man-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/23/iron-man-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>I vaguely remember Iron Man 2 being a much weaker movie than the first Iron Man, but you know, it&amp;rsquo;s actually really good. The action is great, especially the fight scenes with the electro whips and between Iron Man and (not yet named) War Machine. Good stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, Don Cheadle is a great replacement as Rhodes; you can feel Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man at the top of his game (with nothing to lose &lt;spoiler>because he&amp;rsquo;s dying&lt;/spoiler>); and I still think Paltrow makes a great Potts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Incredible Hulk</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/20/the-incredible-hulk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Mar 2021 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/20/the-incredible-hulk/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Bruce Banner: [in a poor Portuguese] Don&amp;rsquo;t make me hungry. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like me when I&amp;rsquo;m hungry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tough Guy Leader: [in Portuguese] What the hell he is talking about?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of bummer that The Incredible Hulk is stuck in sort of a legal loophole and isn&amp;rsquo;t available with all the rest of the MCU on Disney+ (A̸̜̓L̶̬̽L̷̗̋ ̵̦̂Ĥ̴̖A̵͓͋I̴̝̓L̵̺̓ ̶͖̄T̶̿͜H̶̬̊È̷̡ ̸̜̋M̸̮̔O̷̜͒U̶͇̓S̵̺̏Ë̵̝́). On top of that, it&amp;rsquo;s the only main MCU superhero that they&amp;rsquo;ve recast (so far). Conversely though, it&amp;rsquo;s actually (surprisingly) a good movie.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Iron Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/03/iron-man/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/03/iron-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>Way back in 2008, I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone had the slightest idea how far the Marvel Cinematic Universe would go. Taking a less well known superhero (face it, before this few knew who Iron Man was), attaching him to a talented but troubled actor (Robert Downy Jr was an amazing cast) and make a fairly stock standard action movie and&amp;hellip; build a media empire that would span more than 12 years and 20 films (so far&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>X-Men: Days of Future Past</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/06/08/x-men-days-of-future-past/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/06/08/x-men-days-of-future-past/</guid><description>&lt;p>After the awesome first two films, the relative failures of The Last Stand and the Wolverine(s), and the return to form of First Class, I was cautiously hopeful for Days of Future Past. It had potential&amp;ndash;near full casts of both sets of X-Men?&amp;ndash;but potential doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/05/10/the-amazing-spider-man-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/05/10/the-amazing-spider-man-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>I think that&amp;ndash;for once&amp;ndash;I was the perfect audience for this movie.
