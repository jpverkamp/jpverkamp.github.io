At least to me, The Rise of Skywalker did a pretty decent job of closing the loop on the saga that began a long time ago with the rise of Palpatine and the fall of Anakin Skywalker. Really, that&amp;rsquo;s the entire story, and you get that here in spades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were definitely some weird choices made in pacing (in particular, right at the beginning, they sort of drop the whole &amp;lsquo;Emperor is back&amp;rsquo; thing on us&amp;hellip; apparently the reveal came in &amp;hellip; Fortnite? Seriously?). We lose out on a lot of what could have been a cool story with Finn and Poe, although they&amp;rsquo;re still around at least. And I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine that losing Carrie Fisher did filming any favors.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
