&lt;p>On one hand, I really do still think they absolutely nailed Robert Downey Jr. as Iron man. He can do both funny and broken pretty well and has more than a few chances for each this time around. I know now (and didn&amp;rsquo;t then) that there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be an Iron Man 4, but he still did an amazing job in this last solo outing and in the teams ups yet to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise, I actually really liked Gwyneth Paltrow&amp;rsquo;s as Pepper Potts. It&amp;rsquo;s good seeing her as both a foil for Iron Man and actually being a badass in her own right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ben Kingsley still steal the show, although this time around I&amp;rsquo;m coming to see just how much range there was in Guy Pearce&amp;rsquo;s Aldrich Killian. He pulled down on his luck geek up through brilliant and crazy mirror to Tony Stark all the way to &lt;span class="spoiler">fire breathing baddie&lt;/span>
 pretty darn well so far as action movies go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One that I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention last time around, but made all the more apparent I think having just seen in her in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/22/godzilla-vs-kong/">Godzilla vs Kong&lt;/a>) was Rebecca Hall&amp;rsquo;s performance as Maya Hansen. She does smart conflicted scientist very well in both films.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, it was a fascinating way to deal with PTSD, even if does feel a bit sudden (although PTSD can do that) and could really have used a bit deeper dive (not really room for that in a summer blockbuster).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than that, feel free to give my &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/05/iron-man-3/">previous review&lt;/a> a look. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really changed my opinion much, but it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see the two 8 years apart. A lot can change in 8 years&amp;hellip; Both so far as the MCU and in my own life. Some things change, some things stand the tests of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think this time around, I&amp;rsquo;ll slot it in just below the Avengers on both lists. I think Iron Man 3 might actually be the better movie in a lot of ways, but the Avengers I think wins just on sheer spectacle. Feel free to disagree. :) It&amp;rsquo;s all made up numbers anyways.&lt;/p>
