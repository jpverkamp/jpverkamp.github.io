&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not easy being green.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a strange one. She&amp;rsquo;s the Hulk&amp;rsquo;s cousin. One things lead to another, and she gets all Hulked out&amp;hellip; but without any of the downsides?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The contrast between being a Hulk and being a lawyer (and being a big green lawyer) is pretty cool, Tatiana Maslany does a wonderful job in the titular role, and it was great fun to see Tim Roth&amp;rsquo;s Abomination again, not to mention Charlie Cox&amp;rsquo;s Daredevil. Fun casting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s a really weird show. And they&amp;rsquo;re rather solidly into the whoe 4th wall breaking thing, which is kind of amusing. Weird. But amusing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I enjoyed the show. Not my favorite of the MCU TV shows, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have watched it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
