&lt;p&gt;I went to see Man of Steel mostly because I knew it&amp;rsquo;s on the way out of theaters. What I really want to see is Pacific Rim, but I feel like I have a few weeks for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did. Man of Steel is well worth the price of admission and one of the few movies that is definitely worth seeing on a big screen.

There&amp;rsquo;s just something about super hero movies that&amp;rsquo;s going particularly well right now. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how long this is going to last, but I&amp;rsquo;m more than happy to ride it while it does.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
