It&amp;rsquo;s a cute little movie about two young sea monster boys who journey out onto land&amp;ndash;where so long as they don&amp;rsquo;t get wet, they transform to look like humans. Wacky hijinks ensue, there&amp;rsquo;s a meetcute with a young girl, a big race scenes, some quickly resolved drama, and everyone lives happily ever after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not the most thrilling movie, which isn&amp;rsquo;t really something that you expect to see from Pixar&amp;ndash;if it had come from any other studio it would have been pretty impressive. But at the same time, it&amp;rsquo;s a solid enough movie, it&amp;rsquo;s cute, and there were a few laugh out loud moments, so I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have seen it. I fully expect the children will enjoy this one&amp;ndash;although it&amp;rsquo;s rather odd watching it a week after Finding Nemo&amp;ndash;a much better movie made 20 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
