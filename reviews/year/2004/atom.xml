&lt;p&gt;Man this show was huge when it first came out. I watched it then and once since, so this will be my third watch. And this time around I&amp;rsquo;m watching it with someone who (somehow) has never seen it before. To experience all the twists and turns anew with someone? Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first season is awesome. We don&amp;rsquo;t get quite as much mystery and the larger story as later seasons&amp;ndash;but that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we need. Instead, the first season is all about survival&amp;ndash;they did just crash onto a island far &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; away from land after all&amp;ndash;and introducing our cast. And oh, they did that in spades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pilot was, of course&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; awesome. And I do love the first season giving each main character a flashback episode. Locke&amp;rsquo;s (Walkabout) in particular was quite a twist. And oh Hurley&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the characters. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing, with a main cast of over a dozen, how they managed to give each of them (well, most of them) their own over the top backstories and room to breath. I suppose part of that is a side effect of an older style TV season&amp;ndash;when you have over 20 episodes, you have room to actually &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack is great, even if he&amp;rsquo;s got entirely too much of the perfect &amp;lsquo;Doctor savior&amp;rsquo; personality at times. Kate is great, even when she can&amp;rsquo;t stop running. Sawyer is great&amp;ndash;you love to hate him, but he might just be a good man under all that. Locke is a great mystery all around. Hurley is just great. Full stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not to say I don&amp;rsquo;t like the rest of the characters on the island. There&amp;rsquo;s isn&amp;rsquo;t a main cast member in the first season that I don&amp;rsquo;t find worth watching&amp;ndash;and some of them still have room to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I love the slow burn introduction of &amp;lsquo;what is even going &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; on this Island&amp;rsquo;. Monsters in the woods, mysterious noises, hidden structures. It has it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just when they get a chance to leave&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
