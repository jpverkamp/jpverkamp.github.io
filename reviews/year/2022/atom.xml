They certainly turned &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right at the end of Season 1, the innies get a chance to go out. This could not &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; go well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except apparently all is well in the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have drama, both innie and outie and mixed. We have goats. We have sex scenes. We have wives cheating with their own husbands. We have a trip into the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we have a marching band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quite enjoyed this show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I have to wait for season 3!!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Severance: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/25/severance-season-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/25/severance-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s quite a show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the idea is appealing. You split your memories so that you can go to work, get paid, and essentially spend your entire life &lt;em&gt;not at work&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then you start to think about this other you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They never leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They never sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They never have a life outside of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;ndash;is terrifying enough even before you start getting into the whole cult&amp;rsquo;y aspects. And the hallways. And the goats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea where they&amp;rsquo;re going&amp;ndash;(I hope they know)&amp;ndash;but I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it. Onward!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>For All Mankind: Season 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/15/for-all-mankind-season-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/15/for-all-mankind-season-3/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;To MARS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s great seeing how the world is diverging from our own, with another Great Space Race to MARS! This time, not just the US and USSR, but also the private sector (Helios) getting involved, which just manages to make everything more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even with some things so far ahead&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s still the (fictional) 90s. US/USSR tensions are still high. There are still plenty of hidden secrets just waiting to come out at the right moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we jump another decade forward, our original cast (those that have survived at least) are getting older, but still perfectly capable of causing all sorts of chaos. We have a few new faces as well, but I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, less than I expected. There&amp;rsquo;s no way that&amp;rsquo;s sustainable&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, another wonderful season. Man the reviews for this one makes it look worse than it is. It&amp;rsquo;s a show about the space race&amp;hellip; but not just about space. It&amp;rsquo;s also a show about the people &lt;em&gt;going to space&lt;/em&gt;, and some people miss that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite enjoyed it. Looking forward to season 4!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Wednesday</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/25/wednesday/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/25/wednesday/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Oh that&amp;rsquo;s a delight of a show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re creepy and they&amp;rsquo;re kooky&lt;br&gt;
Mysterious and spooky&lt;br&gt;
They&amp;rsquo;re all together ooky&lt;br&gt;
The Addams family&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entire show with the dark worldbuilding and humor of the Addams family, focusing around Wednesday (my favorite)? Yes please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="#casting"&gt;casting&lt;/a&gt; is great&amp;ndash;especially Jenna Ortega as the lead and Emma Myers as Enid. A delightful pairing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mystery vibe is on point (and it&amp;rsquo;s right up to the end before you know &lt;em&gt;for sure&lt;/em&gt; who the baddies are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setting is fun&amp;ndash;even if the &amp;lsquo;outcasts&amp;rsquo; of Nevermore seem curiously non-magical a lot of the times. And then in the big final numbers, we go full on magic&amp;ndash;which also felt surprisingly weird for the Addams family. ut it works well enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to season 2.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Oh that was delightful. How did I not watch this sooner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell: it&amp;rsquo;s a standard &amp;ldquo;save Christmas&amp;rdquo; plotline gone so &lt;em&gt;very &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; alien. With Mantis and Drax having the main plotline to bring Peter Quill that one perfect gift is so fun. They&amp;rsquo;re just alien enough to bring more than a touch of chaos with them to Earth while at the same time human enough to relate to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, don&amp;rsquo;t expect anything deeper than the above. There really isn&amp;rsquo;t anything here you&amp;rsquo;d miss by not watching&amp;ndash;but on the other other hand it&amp;rsquo;s a quick watch and fun enough to be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Werewolf by Night</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/05/werewolf-by-night/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/05/werewolf-by-night/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I managed to skip by this last fall, much to my now dismay. It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;ndash;only sort of an MCU special; focused on the monster/&amp;lsquo;horror&amp;rsquo; side of Marvel comics rather than the super-hero business. They do open with a sillouette of the heroes we know and love&amp;hellip; before all color drains out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes next? An introduction to a monster hunting family/society and a competition to win the mysterious &amp;lsquo;Bloodstone&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;which gives you a sort of power over/against monsters. And then&amp;ndash;the HUNT/BATTLE ROYALE!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Wakanda Forever</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/wakanda-forever/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/wakanda-forever/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How?&lt;br&gt;
How is never as important as why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. How do you fill the giant Chadwick Boseman shaped hole in the MCU?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently&amp;hellip; with funeral services, Atlantis (but not), mer-Hermes (the first self described mutant in the MCU), and&amp;ndash;eventually&amp;ndash;someone new to take up the mantle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; fine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were certainly some pretty spectacular action scenes. The under water scenes are pretty&amp;ndash;even if they only sort of make sense. The character and costume design continues to impress. And there are giant piles of funeral services and mourning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the sudden introduction of an entire (large) underwater civilization feels&amp;hellip; weird. And as we&amp;rsquo;ve had before with the Marvel movies, some of the big battle set pieces don&amp;rsquo;t make that much sense. They&amp;rsquo;re going out on a boat to fight water people. All to&amp;hellip; limit how many fighters they have to film? And then all but like ten people die and we&amp;rsquo;re just okay with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s about the middle of the road so far as Marvel movies go for me. Pretty good, decent action, but there have been better entries. Pretty high up for 2023, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably more because I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen that many movies this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Rings of Power: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/04/the-rings-of-power-season-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 23:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/04/the-rings-of-power-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Well that’s quite the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They couldn’t/didn’t get the rights to the third age, so instead we get much older stories. Stories after the fall of Morgoth but still during the end of the era of Elves and Númenor. Before the rise of the kingdoms of Men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot crammed into eight episodes. One might argue too much. Leaves some stories a bit thin. But really, having seen them, I don’t know what I’d cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth a watch. Looking forward to season two!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>She-Hulk: Attorney at Law</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/14/she-hulk-attorney-at-law/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/14/she-hulk-attorney-at-law/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not easy being green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that&amp;rsquo;s a strange one. She&amp;rsquo;s the Hulk&amp;rsquo;s cousin. One things lead to another, and she gets all Hulked out&amp;hellip; but without any of the downsides?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrast between being a Hulk and being a lawyer (and being a big green lawyer) is pretty cool, Tatiana Maslany does a wonderful job in the titular role, and it was great fun to see Tim Roth&amp;rsquo;s Abomination again, not to mention Charlie Cox&amp;rsquo;s Daredevil. Fun casting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s a really weird show. And they&amp;rsquo;re rather solidly into the whoe 4th wall breaking thing, which is kind of amusing. Weird. But amusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I enjoyed the show. Not my favorite of the MCU TV shows, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have watched it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I Am Groot</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/28/i-am-groot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/28/i-am-groot/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re ~3 minute shorts (with 3+ minutes of credits each) about a young reincarnation of a tree-person who can&amp;rsquo;t talk, other than to say &amp;lsquo;I Am Groot&amp;rsquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I was expecting, but for what they are&amp;hellip; they&amp;rsquo;re cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth the 15 minutes to watch them all. :D&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Everything Everywhere All at Once</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/23/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/23/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Laundry and taxes. Hotdog fingers and Raccacoonie. Googly third eyes and sex toy fueled kung fu fights. The truest &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; bagel there ever was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that was a delightfully &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything at all of that sounds interesting (especially the &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; part) and you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen this movie yet, go see it. Don&amp;rsquo;t spoil it. I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Thor: Love and Thunder</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/31/thor-love-and-thunder/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/31/thor-love-and-thunder/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/28/thor/"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; was probably the most underwhelming of Phase 1, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/12/thor-the-dark-world/"&gt;Thor: The Dark World&lt;/a&gt; tried to go more fantasy and was mostly forgettable, and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/16/thor-ragnarok/"&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/a&gt; was a blast. Getting better all the time, so &amp;hellip; what about &lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to love about the movie: Hemsworth&amp;rsquo;s sense of humor, Portman back and then some, Thompson&amp;rsquo;s awesome and slightly awkward Valkyrie. And of course Bale plays a solidly terrifying baddy in Gorr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of movie to get through here, probably more than a bit too much. A cancer plot, succession jealousy, a threat spanning across the Galaxy (or at least the gods thereof)&amp;ndash;heck, the idea that gods are just &lt;em&gt;a thing&lt;/em&gt; now, Thor unpacking even more trauma. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot to put into a single movie and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; work. It&amp;rsquo;s still a solid enough flick, but not nearly up to what &lt;em&gt;Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, pretty impressive for the first 4th solo outing in the MCU. Because that&amp;rsquo;s a thing we can say now.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/29/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/29/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So. That&amp;rsquo;s what what you get if you take a &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/directors/sam-raimi"&gt;director best known for his horror movies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and let them loose in the MCU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like it. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ms. Marvel</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/23/ms.-marvel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/23/ms.-marvel/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ms. Marvel is not particularly earth-shattering. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t deal with the end of the world and only barely with the greater MCU (although there is a decent bit of &amp;lsquo;how the world changes with superheroes in it, like Ant-Man&amp;rsquo;s podcast and Avengercon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it is though? A awful lot of fun. Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan is just an absolute delight and really looks like she had a great time in the role. The whole supporting cast is great as well, especially Kamala&amp;rsquo;s family and friends Bruno and Nakia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamala Khan: [whispers] I&amp;rsquo;m a super hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[She runs off gleefully]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this. Especially when it leaned into the Muslim + Pakistani culture and the family dynamics of the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheikh Abdullah: I don’t need anyone on my side. I’m not even concerned if God is on my side as long as I am on His side. God is always right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agent Deever: I don’t have time for Quranic quotes. Excuse me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheikh Abdullah: Actually, that was Abraham Lincoln.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big fights and greater threats were kind of cheesey and didn&amp;rsquo;t mesh as well (especially the big showpiece in the final episode), but the down to earth human parts of being a teenager superhero? Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so hard to rank these any more, since there&amp;rsquo;s just so much to love in the MCU. I think Ms. Marvel ends up pretty squarely in the middle of the pack&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;d still say it&amp;rsquo;s worth a watch. Onward.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
