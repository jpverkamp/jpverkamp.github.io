Especially a crude (at times) time loop + romantic comedy.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Nyles: I guess you followed me. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those infinite time loop situations you might have heard about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sarah: That I might have heard about?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nyles: Yeah.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I think that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much the best part about the movie: there is more than one person trapped in and aware of the loop and Nyles at least is perfectly genre aware. He&amp;rsquo;s seen the time loop movies and knows how screwed up they can be.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tenet</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/06/tenet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/06/tenet/</guid><description>&lt;p>That &amp;hellip; is a summer blockbuster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an absolutely bonkers plot. In a nutshell, the future is at war with the present (somehow) and there is technology that can &amp;lsquo;invert&amp;rsquo; people and things so that they experience time backwards. How exactly that works and what exactly happens when you mess with the past/future is&amp;hellip; never entirely clear. But it certainly does make for some absolutely crazy action scenes where some things are going forward, some backward, people are in the same scene more than once and&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
