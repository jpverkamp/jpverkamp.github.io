&lt;p>No one ever has the right to take the life of another.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But perhaps, sometimes, you do have the responsibility to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that&amp;hellip; was certainly a show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an absolutely fascinating combination of weird anime sci-fi and more than a touch of weird western. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a few memorable characters (some perhaps&amp;hellip; too memorable), some weirdly wonderful worldbuilding and setting moments, and all sorts of gunfights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I can really recommend it. It started out weird, took a while to make any particular sense, and just when I felt it was getting there&amp;hellip; it ended. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly interesting, I&amp;rsquo;ll give it that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few question I still have after the show (spoilers):&lt;/p>
&lt;span class="spoiler">Where in the world did the names Vash and Millions Knives even come from? They're so different.&lt;/span>

&lt;p>And:&lt;/p>
&lt;span class="spoiler">Who (or what) were the Gung-Ho Guns? Literal demons? Natives? Weird humanity? What's with the vastly differently sized people.&lt;/span></description></item></channel></rss>
