&lt;p>(Side note: This also came back to mind since Ben Stiller wrote a good amount of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/severance/">Severance&lt;/a> of all things.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s a ridiculous and fun movie. The whole premise&amp;ndash;that a magical artifact somehow animates all the exhibits at the museum every night&amp;ndash;yet somehow no one has ever noticed this? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the list bit of sense. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it any less fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Easter Island Head: HEY!&lt;br>
[pauses]&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: Dum-dum.&lt;br>
Larry: Yes?&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: You give me gum-gum!&lt;br>
Larry: I give you gum-gum?&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: You new Dum-dum. You give me gum-gum.&lt;br>
Larry: Gee, okay, you know what? I have no gum-gum. Sorry. And my name isn&amp;rsquo;t Dum-dum. My name&amp;rsquo;s Larry.&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: No, your name Dum-dum.&lt;br>
[some people are running away]&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: Oh, you in trouble, Dum-dum. You better run-run. From Attila the Hun-hun.&lt;br>
[Attila yells and chases Larry]&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: See you later, Dum-dum!&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There are a lot of fun action scenes in the movie. Just don&amp;rsquo;t think about it all too hard and enjoy the ride. I especially loved the chaos of the dioramas of thousands of tiny men come to life and fighting one another. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Jedediah: No problemo, Gigantor.&lt;br>
Larry: Um, my name&amp;rsquo;s Larry, first of all okay, Jed? See, I call you Jed, I don&amp;rsquo;t call you tiny, right?&lt;br>
Jedediah: What&amp;rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&lt;br>
Larry: Hey teeny, how does that sound?&lt;br>
Jedediah: I&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t like it. It hurts my feelings.&lt;br>
Larry: Okay, well Gigantor makes me feel like some sort of freak.&lt;br>
Octavius: I don&amp;rsquo;t. I just call you Larry.&lt;br>
Larry: Don&amp;rsquo;t be a kiss-ass.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The casting in this movie is a big strength! Dick Van Dyke was a lot of fun as old former night watchman Cecil. Robin Williams (RIP :sad:) is always a delight and his Teddy Roosevelt was no exception. Rami Malek is certainly no &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/mr.-robot/">Mr. Robot&lt;/a>, but he&amp;rsquo;s got a perfect presence as Ahkmenrah. And Steve Coogan as Octavius and Owen Wilson&amp;rsquo;s Jedediah were hilarious (especially since the latter was originally a minor cameo).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And you know? Apparently &amp;lsquo;The real-life American Museum of Natural History had 20% more visitors during the holiday season following this movie&amp;rsquo;s opening.&amp;rsquo; So good on them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now the sequels? No idea where they go from here, but you know what? Worth a try!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doctor Who: Season 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/25/doctor-who-season-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/25/doctor-who-season-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m still re-watching Doctor Who in fits and starts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, after all that was great with Eccleston/Nine in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/02/doctor-who-season-1/">season 1&lt;/a>, how we get Tennant/Ten. Oh, I do enjoy his take on the doctor. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect mix of a whimsical seeing what he can get away with&amp;ndash;with the absolute feel of sadness and age that a being like the Doctor really should be feeling&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And all with Rose along for the ride. Rose gets a lot of hate at times, but I really think she was a pretty good first nu-Who companion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this season, we a fair few two parters, a bunch of great episodes. &lt;a href="#4-the-girl-in-the-fireplace">The Girl in the Fireplace&lt;/a> is a great take on &amp;rsquo;the Time Travelers wife&amp;rsquo; sort of thing. &lt;a href="#5-rise-of-the-cybermen">Rise of the Cybermen&lt;/a>/&lt;a href="#6-age-of-steel">Age of Steel&lt;/a> introduces us to some old foes. &lt;a href="#8-the-impossible-planet">The Impossible Planet&lt;/a>/&lt;a href="#9-satan-pit">Satan Pit&lt;/a> &lt;em>really&lt;/em> start getting into Doctor Who as sci-fi/horror (and I love it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="#10-love--monsters">Love &amp;amp; Monsters&lt;/a>. That&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; actually not that bad? It&amp;rsquo;s definitely one of the &amp;lsquo;Doctor-lite&amp;rsquo; episodes, which are always something interesting to try. The ending is crass and kind of terrifying to really think about&amp;ndash;rather than the laughs you might think they were going for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a solid season!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And &lt;a href="#special-the-runaway-bride">the special&lt;/a> introduces Donna! Even if she won&amp;rsquo;t be back for a bit, she&amp;rsquo;s certainly a contender for my favorite companion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doctor Who: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/02/doctor-who-season-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/02/doctor-who-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve watched through modern Doctor Who a few times, but it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually caught the 13th Doctor yet, let alone 14 and 15&amp;hellip; Now, with the new &amp;lsquo;reboot&amp;rsquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s about time to give it another go. And a good time to review them this time around!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, I love this show. It&amp;rsquo;s wacky and cheap looking at times. Tonally, we&amp;rsquo;re all over the place, from farting aliens right up to the borders (if not more so) of horror with The Empty Child. Callbacks to the old show (which I still haven&amp;rsquo;t watched, one day) and all new friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do wish we&amp;rsquo;d gotten more of Eccelston, I forgot how much I liked his Doctor. But still, it&amp;rsquo;s good to have what we have!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Underworld: Evolution</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/17/underworld-evolution/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/17/underworld-evolution/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quite an interesting contrast compared to the first &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/underworld/">Underworld&lt;/a>. Where the first was a straight forward vampire/werewolf urban fantasy action flick, Evolution tries to be more. We get deeper worldbuilding, more backstory&amp;ndash;especially for Selene&amp;ndash;and more hints that the entire world is changing. It works&amp;hellip; well enough?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/14/pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-mans-chest/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/14/pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-mans-chest/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl/">Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&lt;/a> was surprisingly good. So of course they&amp;rsquo;re going to make a sequel and turn everything up to 11. More Johnny Depp (yay)! More love triangles (boo)! More supernatural beasties (awesome)! More mythology (sweet)!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the plus side, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to like. As mentioned Depp is still great. That&amp;rsquo;s probably the number one reasons these movies are as awesome as they are. He just nails the roll.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
