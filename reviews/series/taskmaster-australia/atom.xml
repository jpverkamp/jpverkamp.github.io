It&amp;rsquo;s not like there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much of an overarching plot between seasons that you have to keep up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And man, this is a fun bit. Another series, another Taskmaster! And another assistant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom (Gleeson). And lesser Tom (Cashman) are a lot of fun together. I love that lesser Tom can never keep a straight face when teh contestants screw up. It&amp;rsquo;s delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And oh the cast was a lot of fun. Anne and Lloyd as a couple on the show together made for some great moments. Wil and Tom being old friends is a dynamic we&amp;rsquo;ve seen before in the British version but it&amp;rsquo;s always fun. Josh was quite a wildcard at times. And Jenny was one of the reasons I came to this version of the show&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen her acts on YouTube before and she&amp;rsquo;s a wonderfully weird mix and has a lot of those &amp;lsquo;young enough to make the other contestants feel old&amp;rsquo; moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, another great season of Taskmaster. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to catch more of the Australian version! LIke season 1 &amp;#x1f604;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
