We&amp;rsquo;ve got more history, more direct interactions with the demons (and slight humanization to them, which is an interesting choice), and more character building with both the family and those around it. Man, I just want to give them all a big hug.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I so very look forward to Season 3!

Turns out: also really good. While they changed a few things with the details of how the keys worked that are probably more efficient to do in TV (not opening the tops of people&amp;rsquo;s heads for instance), it&amp;rsquo;s still got the same wonderfully creepy dark magical vibe. I do love the actors&amp;ndash;Bode in particular does his part very well, as do his siblings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man that&amp;rsquo;s a crazy show. Well worth the show (warning, it is dark, although not overly graphic). On to season 2!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
