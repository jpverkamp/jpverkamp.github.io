&lt;p&gt;“All my life,” she said, “I have been told ‘go’ and ‘come.’ I am told how I will live, and I am told how I must die. I must be a man’s servant and a mare for his pleasure, or I must hide myself behind walls and surrender my flesh to a cold, silent god. I would walk into the jaws of hell itself, if it were a path of my own choosing. I would rather die tomorrow in the forest than live a hundred years of the life appointed me. Please. Please let me help you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bear and the Nightingale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, what happens if you take a Russian fairy tale and expand it to the full length of a novel while still managing to keep both the whimsical magical aspects&amp;hellip; and all the dark bits as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We go through years, watching as our main character Vasya is born (and her mother dies), up through when she&amp;rsquo;s a teenager on the cusp of being married off&amp;ndash;or sent to a monastery. She never quite fits in and makes for a wonderful point of view into this wordl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we see Russia &amp;lsquo;growing up&amp;rsquo; as well, abandoning the old gods and spirits of the forest in favor of the Church. It&amp;rsquo;s not the only conflict of the story (or, I&amp;rsquo;d argue, even the main one), but it does underlie the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing changes, Vasya. Things are, or they are not. Magic is forgetting that something ever was other than as you willed it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a delightful, haunting sort of story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: I did not realize this was a trilogy until writing this review! More to read!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
