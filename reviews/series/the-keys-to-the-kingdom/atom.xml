&lt;p>Overall, everything I was hoping for in an ending to the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We get to see a lot of Sunday and Sunday&amp;rsquo;s realm: the Incomparable Gardens. It makes as much sense as anything in the rest of the House, so just go with it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Superior Saturday</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/04/superior-saturday/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/04/superior-saturday/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I like the visuals around Saturday&amp;rsquo;s realm. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the better ones when it comes to motivation and the idea of a gigantic clockwork tower stretching upwards&amp;hellip; cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, we saw even less of Saturday than we did of Friday, which is saying something. I think she and Arthur were in the same scene for maybe a half dozen paragraphs? It&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird. I assume we&amp;rsquo;ll see more of her in the next book, but it&amp;rsquo;s something of a departure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lady Friday</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/03/lady-friday/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/03/lady-friday/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting throughout the whole series, Nix has managed to combine a relatively formulaic story with new twists and weird new worlds in each and every book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The House just keeps getting weirder. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how it&amp;rsquo;s even really a &amp;lsquo;House&amp;rsquo; at all. I think originally it was going to be and the Tuesday and Wednesday happened&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sir Thursday</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/02/sir-thursday/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/02/sir-thursday/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Not much to say. Onwards and upwards for Arthur, taking on another of the Trustees and gaining another of the Keys.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pretty much all of the problems in this book seemed overly easy to subdue, the Skinless Boy and Sir Thursday included. I think this has been going on for all of the rest of the books, but it seemed even more obvious in this one. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s a factor of how relatively short they are?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Drowned Wednesday</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/31/drowned-wednesday/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/31/drowned-wednesday/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The world of the Keys to the Kingdom continues to get more interesting and weirder all at once. This time around, we have a sort of Multiversal Ocean and the Morrow Day that governs it. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting world all itself, with ships that were once other things, uplifted rats, and a very Nix&amp;rsquo;ian version of the Jonah and Whale story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s neat to finally see one of the Morrow Days that actually wants to help. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing we won&amp;rsquo;t see much of that with the other half.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Grim Tuesday</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/31/grim-tuesday/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/31/grim-tuesday/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Of course they&amp;rsquo;re all going to take place over a week (Earth time)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s really not much different between Mister Monday and Grim Tuesday. Arthur is starting to accept his fate while at the same time learning more about the rules of the House. It interesting to see him change even in just the first two books thus far.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mister Monday</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/30/mister-monday/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/30/mister-monday/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that Arthur died. He had a massive asthma attack, and, as his oxygen starved brain struggled its last, he hallucinated all of the rest. How else do you describe just how &amp;hellip; odd this book is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, I liked it. It&amp;rsquo;s weird. Garth Nix really does his Proper Nouns. Everything felt like it Meant Something, although we never quite got a perfect idea what Anything was. Most of them were close enough though; so it goes. It&amp;rsquo;s quick and the action picks you up and pulls you right through the story. When it&amp;rsquo;s over, there&amp;rsquo;s something of a feel of getting off a roller coaster, but in a good way.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
