Iron Man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole idea that they don’t know that Iron Man is a man in a suit rather than a robot and that for some reason Tony wants to keep it that way—and thinks that he can is a bit crazy to me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not to mention that the healing factor (and thus Tony’s disregard for getting hurt) still feels wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A really weird/rough way to take Iron Man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a bit of a bummer, since I enjoyed Card’s earlier writing (Ender’s game primarily) even if his later stuff got weird and preachy. But I still had hope…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ready to move on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Iron Man, Vol. 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/12/ultimate-iron-man-vol.-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/12/ultimate-iron-man-vol.-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>That is not at all what I expected. Tony Stark, born with super powers. Constant pain and a regeneration factor. It’s… quite different. Too different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think there’s a reason this was later removed from the Ultimate Marvel canon.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
