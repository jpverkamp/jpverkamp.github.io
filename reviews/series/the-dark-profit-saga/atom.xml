&lt;p>Not all who wander are lost; some are on quests.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That was a very strange book. More than anything, it felt like &amp;lsquo;what if all of the more &lt;em>game&lt;/em> parts of Dungeons and Dragons were real, what would that change about the world?&amp;rsquo;. Oh, and dig into the economics of it along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We literally have an adventuring industry with heroes funded by corporate interests buying stakes in the eventual loot. Some sort of &amp;rsquo;level&amp;rsquo; system where you can turn in records of kills for advancement. Noncombat Paper Carries (NPCs).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a D&amp;amp;D satire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the biggest weakness to me was more one of expectations. I actually expected it to go even more into the economics (that don&amp;rsquo;t really make &lt;em>any&lt;/em> sense) of a adventuring based society. It&amp;rsquo;s there, but it could have been so much more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, I did enjoy the book, it was a fun read and the sense of humor was on point. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to check out the sequels at some point.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
