            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it ends. I&amp;rsquo;ve had some issues with this series (mostly with some of the relationship drama present throughout), but I&amp;rsquo;m glad I finished it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Characterwise, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I liked what happened to either Tom or Hester. Tom is entirely too naive. Pennyroyal literally shot him&amp;ndash;and this is likely to kill him one day. He enslaved Tom&amp;rsquo;s daughter. And he doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to care. He&amp;rsquo;s good to a fault and it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem real. Hester&amp;hellip; is crazy and violent and full of a desire for vengeance and it&amp;rsquo;s only worse this time around. This time it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel unreal&amp;ndash;what does that say about me?&amp;ndash;but it&amp;rsquo;s still sad that she ended up this way. Wren and Theo I liked a lot more. I wish they would have spent less time separated nearly missing one another again and again, but it works out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Predator&#39;s Gold</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Predator&amp;rsquo;s Gold does a solid job of expanding on what was the best part of Mortal Engines: the world building all around mobile cities that eat one another. We get to see a few more cities&amp;ndash;both predators and trading cities&amp;ndash;along with more details on airships in this world. But the real worldbuilding gold&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is in the parasites that can attach themselves to cities and steal from them. It really makes the cities feel like gigantic living organisms as much as anything, which I&amp;rsquo;m sure is Reeve&amp;rsquo;s intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I very nearly put Predator&amp;rsquo;s Gold down several times during the first half of the book. There&amp;rsquo;s a rather blatant love triangle between Tom, Hester, and Freya (princess of Anchorage&amp;ndash;roving city of the north nearly destroyed by a plague in the recent past). It really doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense given Tom and Hester&amp;rsquo;s relationship at the end of the first book and drags on way too long. Perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s what some people read the book for&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s really not for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
