That was a sequel. Published 4 years after &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/12/03/the-rook/">The Rook&lt;/a>, we have a weird combination of following the events of the first book (Stiletto takes place perhaps a few months later as the Checquy and Grafters are coming together for peace meetings) but with two completely new main characters (a Pawn Felicity and a teenager Grafter Odette, descendant of one of the leaders).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So far as openings go, that was certainly one to get my attention.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
