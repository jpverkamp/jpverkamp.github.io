      <description>&lt;figure class=&#34;cover-image&#34;&gt;
                &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;84119&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84119.the-horse-and-his-boy&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/the-horse-and-his-boy.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually really enjoyed &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;84119&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84119.the-horse-and-his-boy&#34;&gt;The Horse and His Boy&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s the first book with a completely new main character. None of either the four original children or their cousin Eustace take up a main role. Although they do show up, it&amp;rsquo;s in a more minor capacity. A nice way to shake things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timelinewise, it takes place after most of &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;100915&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100915.the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe&#34;&gt;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&lt;/a&gt;, but before the end when the children have grown and return to their own world. So Narnia is at peace, but it&amp;rsquo;s a new peace. So when we get to follow an outside threat (we hadn&amp;rsquo;t otherwise heard of) from countries that have been mentioned but only barely&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Silver Chair</title>

                &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;65641&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65641.the-silver-chair&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/the-silver-chair.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;65641&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65641.the-silver-chair&#34;&gt;The Silver Chair&lt;/a&gt; takes place a year and a lifetime after &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;140225&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140225.the-voyage-of-the-dawn-treader&#34;&gt;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&lt;/a&gt;. In our world, Eustace (no N apparently) has grown up slightly and is now attending a&amp;ndash;gasp&amp;ndash;hyper secular school&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:belief&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:belief&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. He&amp;rsquo;s still for the most part the better character he grew to be on his voyages and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see someone we&amp;rsquo;ve seen before. But in Narnia, his friend King Caspian is old, with a son of his own, missing for years in his own right. And of course Eustace screws up his first&amp;ndash;and perhaps last&amp;ndash;meeting with an old friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along for the ride is the first new female character we&amp;rsquo;ve seen in a while: Jill. She goes to school with Eustance and the both of them are outcasts, being bullied. I like her. One problem we&amp;rsquo;ve always had with Narnia is that women/girls are either perfect (like Susan and Lucy) or evil (like the White Witch). Jill is a pretty decent yet still nicely conflicted woman. I love this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;140225&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140225.the-voyage-of-the-dawn-treader&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/the-voyage-of-the-dawn-treader.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;121749&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121749.prince-caspian&#34;&gt;Prince Caspian&lt;/a&gt; much more closely than it in turn followed &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;100915&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100915.the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe&#34;&gt;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;140225&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140225.the-voyage-of-the-dawn-treader&#34;&gt;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&lt;/a&gt; follows King Caspian along with Edmund, Lucy, and new character cousin Eustance as they set out on a great voyage across the sea to find a series of Lords exiled before Caspian took the throne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, the entire book basically takes the form of a series of smaller adventures, each taking a chapter or two. It reminds me a lot of Ulysses; perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s the boat connection. Each of the stories is actually pretty good (my daughter and I both particularly enjoyed the Dufflepuds. They&amp;rsquo;re just silly enough for her age group. That being said, it&amp;rsquo;s weird that the King can do something like that (leaving his kindom, potentially for years) and it means that the story doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much of an overarching plot, but it works well enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Prince Caspian</title>
      <link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/10/26/prince-caspian/</link>

                &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;121749&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121749.prince-caspian&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/prince-caspian.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things never happen the same way twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to read this back to back with &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;100915&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100915.the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe&#34;&gt;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&lt;/a&gt; (as you should if you&amp;rsquo;re reading them in published order). For the children, only a year has passed, but for Narnia, it&amp;rsquo;s been far, far longer. So long, in fact, that talking animals, walking trees, and even Aslan himself are little more than myths and the Age of Man has come to a land we once knew.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;100915&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100915.the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;297249&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/297249.the-boxcar-children&#34;&gt;The Boxcar Children&lt;/a&gt; (the first 19) to my children, so now it&amp;rsquo;s off to Narnia with &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;100915&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100915.the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe&#34;&gt;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&lt;/a&gt; (in publication order). Oh man, we&amp;rsquo;re in for a ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this story for you, but when I began it I had not realized that &amp;gt; girls grow quicker than books. As a result you are already too old for fairy &amp;gt; tales, and by the time it is printed and bound you will be older still. But &amp;gt; some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again. You can &amp;gt; then take it down from some upper shelf, dust it, and tell me what you think &amp;gt; of it. I shall probably be too deaf to hear, and too old to understand a &amp;gt; word you say, but I shall still be your affectionate Godfather, C. S. Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;
