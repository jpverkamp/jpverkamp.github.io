&lt;p>“Oh, hell,” Kelsier said. “There’s actually a God?” “Yes.” Kelsier decked him.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve read the Mistborn series, read Secret History. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t, read the Mistborn series, then read Secret History. It&amp;rsquo;s worth the read just for for the the crazy intertwined universe-building that Sanderson has been pulling off for years now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Eleventh Metal</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/19/the-eleventh-metal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/19/the-eleventh-metal/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Eleventh Metal is a short story originally written for the Mistborn Adventure Game (an RPG) that takes place before the events of the first Mistborn book. It gives us a bit more backstory about Kelsier and actually shows his own training, which is interesting enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s not bad. It&amp;rsquo;s just very short and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really add anything in particular to the rest of the Mistborn stories.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Bands of Mourning</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/07/12/the-bands-of-mourning/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/07/12/the-bands-of-mourning/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sanderson has this tendency to completely change the world in ways that you&amp;rsquo;d never think could possibly work&amp;hellip; and yet pull them off. He did it between the first and second Mistborn books and he just did it again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worldbuilding-wise, so many things have changed. Yet he hasn&amp;rsquo;t really broken the rules that he set down in the previous books, just expanded them, exploring areas that we&amp;rsquo;ve never seen before. We learn about people that live far from the Lord Ruler&amp;rsquo;s rule. We learn about new and fascinating ways that the Metallic Arts can be used&amp;ndash;Feruchemy in particular. And we start to see just how magic and technology can be combined.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shadows of Self</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/25/shadows-of-self/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/25/shadows-of-self/</guid><description>&lt;p>Shadows of Self takes place in the same timeline and with mostly the same characters as Alloy of Law. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard, this is supposed to be the actual first book of the second trilogy, with Alloy of Law being essentially a happy accident.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wax and Wayne are back, in all their awesome glory. I still greatly enjoy what Sanderson did both with their Allomantic/Feruchemic abilities (they&amp;rsquo;re more interesting / real feeling that the full Mistborn of the original trilogy) along with their great personalities. Wayne is the best sort of crazy and Wax is just as driven as ever. Marasi also gets a chance to shine as well, becoming a constable in her own right and putting her sharp mind, passion, and years of schooling to good use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Alloy of Law</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/11/the-alloy-of-law/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/11/the-alloy-of-law/</guid><description>&lt;p>In Alloy of Law, Sanderson demonstrates not one, but two things that he&amp;rsquo;s done which I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen another author pull off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For one, he has a massive shared universe in the Cosmere. Each world has its own unique magic system (Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s strength) with just enough relation to the others to hint that they might just be part of a bigger universe.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hero of Ages</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/05/the-hero-of-ages/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/05/the-hero-of-ages/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ever since the Lord Ruler was killed in the first Mistborn book, things have been getting worse. It all comes to a head in The Hero of Ages. The world is quite literally ending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s strength continues to be his world building. We get a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> more details this time around. We learn of a few more Allomantic metals. We learn all about the third metallic art (only previously hinted at): Hemalurgy. On top of that, we expand on what exactly the Koloss and Kandra are, what abilities they have, and how they came to be. It&amp;rsquo;s crazy awesome how it all fits together and would be well worth the read just got that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Well of Ascension</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/05/16/the-well-of-ascension/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/05/16/the-well-of-ascension/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since last I read this book, I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten just how much happens in this book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the Lord Ruler was killed in The Final Empire, some things have gotten better&amp;hellip; some have gotten much much worse.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Final Empire</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/05/01/the-final-empire/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/05/01/the-final-empire/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Final Empire is a great read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love the worldbuilding. It&amp;rsquo;s a weird world, with strange nightly mists and a near constant fall of ash that gets on everything. Even stranger, it&amp;rsquo;s hinted that the world was once much more like our own. On top of that, you have a quasi-Feudal society ruled by a powerful, potentially immortal being. All of which leads to some pretty obvious seeds for some crazy stuff to go on.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
