&lt;p&gt;“Oh, hell,” Kelsier said. “There’s actually a God?” “Yes.” Kelsier decked him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve read the Mistborn series, read Secret History. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t, read the Mistborn series, then read Secret History. It&amp;rsquo;s worth the read just for for the the crazy intertwined universe-building that Sanderson has been pulling off for years now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Eleventh Metal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Eleventh Metal is a short story originally written for the Mistborn Adventure Game (an RPG) that takes place before the events of the first Mistborn book. It gives us a bit more backstory about Kelsier and actually shows his own training, which is interesting enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s not bad. It&amp;rsquo;s just very short and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really add anything in particular to the rest of the Mistborn stories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Bands of Mourning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sanderson has this tendency to completely change the world in ways that you&amp;rsquo;d never think could possibly work&amp;hellip; and yet pull them off. He did it between the first and second Mistborn books and he just did it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldbuilding-wise, so many things have changed. Yet he hasn&amp;rsquo;t really broken the rules that he set down in the previous books, just expanded them, exploring areas that we&amp;rsquo;ve never seen before. We learn about people that live far from the Lord Ruler&amp;rsquo;s rule. We learn about new and fascinating ways that the Metallic Arts can be used&amp;ndash;Feruchemy in particular. And we start to see just how magic and technology can be combined.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Hero of Ages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since the Lord Ruler was killed in the first Mistborn book, things have been getting worse. It all comes to a head in The Hero of Ages. The world is quite literally ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s strength continues to be his world building. We get a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more details this time around. We learn of a few more Allomantic metals. We learn all about the third metallic art (only previously hinted at): Hemalurgy. On top of that, we expand on what exactly the Koloss and Kandra are, what abilities they have, and how they came to be. It&amp;rsquo;s crazy awesome how it all fits together and would be well worth the read just got that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since last I read this book, I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten just how much happens in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Lord Ruler was killed in The Final Empire, some things have gotten better&amp;hellip; some have gotten much much worse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Final Empire</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Final Empire is a great read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the worldbuilding. It&amp;rsquo;s a weird world, with strange nightly mists and a near constant fall of ash that gets on everything. Even stranger, it&amp;rsquo;s hinted that the world was once much more like our own. On top of that, you have a quasi-Feudal society ruled by a powerful, potentially immortal being. All of which leads to some pretty obvious seeds for some crazy stuff to go on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
