This time around, we&amp;rsquo;re not directly following either Lilith or Akin, but rather Jodahs, perhaps the least human protagonist of the series&amp;ndash;as he will be the first human/Oankali hybrid that appears to be growing up to be neither male nor female, instead growing up ooloi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating and weird point of view, especially given that he&amp;rsquo;s even more alien than the ooloi have been all along&amp;ndash;which is saying something. With his human traits, he has even more power to literally rewrite the genes of anything he touches.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adulthood Rites</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/08/22/adulthood-rites/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/08/22/adulthood-rites/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="116249" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116249.adulthood-rites"> Adulthood Rites &lt;/a> follows up with the story of Lilith and the alien invasion / our alien saviors set out in &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="60929" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60929.dawn"> Dawn &lt;/a> . This time around though, the main point of view follows Akin. A first generation child of an Oankali/human/Ooloi five parent mating&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s about as weird and interesting as it sounds-who starts the story as a rather precocious (for a human) one year old.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see a more alien and childlike point of view on the world &lt;a data-goodreads-type="author" data-goodreads-id="29535" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/29535.octavia-e-butler"> Octavia E. Butler &lt;/a> built, especially as Akin spends a chunk of time among pure human resistors, becoming something of their champion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dawn</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/08/15/dawn/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/08/15/dawn/</guid><description>&lt;p>Octavia Butler&amp;rsquo;s Xenogenesis / &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="60926" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60926.liliths-brood">Lilith&amp;#39;s Brood&lt;/a> (&lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="60929" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60929.dawn">Dawn&lt;/a>, &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="116249" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116249.adulthood-rites">Adulthood Rites&lt;/a>, and &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="60934" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60934.imago">Imago&lt;/a>) have been on my &amp;rsquo;to read&amp;rsquo; list for rather a long while, highly recommended by any number of people. I see why now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dawn starts with humanity wiping itself mostly out and the titular Lilith waking up in the next best thing to a cell on what she later learns is an alien spacecraft. The aliens (the Oankali) are alien, with a culture and lifestyle built around exchanging genetic material with races across the universe, changing themselves radically along the way. They&amp;rsquo;ve given humanity a chance to survive&amp;ndash;but only if we change ourselves along the way.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
