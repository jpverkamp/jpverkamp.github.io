In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/04/17/the-quantum-garden/">The Quantum Garden&lt;/a>, we got a sort of sequel-prequel, that sort of kind of answered how that all came to be (time travel is weird). Finally now, in The Quantum Evolution, we&amp;rsquo;re starting to get some of the effects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out that by showing off his Quantum MAGIC!(tm), Bel has brought quite a lot more attention than he ever intended to Homo Quantus. And now everone wants a piece of him and his.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The characters still drive teh book. Bel and Cass remain Bel and Cas. Stills remains delightfully crass. I was delighted to see Marie again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then&amp;hellip; the Puppets. That&amp;rsquo;s quite the weird, uncomfortable part of these books and it&amp;rsquo;s even more to the fore in this one. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; probably worth something to have read it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this is the last book, it&amp;rsquo;s a weird one. There&amp;rsquo;s a big epic conclusion, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel completely earned. The stakes are higher than ever, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel particularly &amp;rsquo;new&amp;rsquo; this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, the first book is the best. The next two are worth reading. And I would probably read a fourth. But for now&amp;hellip; onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Quantum Garden</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/04/17/the-quantum-garden/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/04/17/the-quantum-garden/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/04/14/the-quantum-magician/">The Quantum Magician&lt;/a> was a wonderful bit of scifi worldbuilding and technology wrapped around a heist novel. Future tech harnessing time travel and the forces driving the inflation of the universe and you have to sneak it right through a wormhole and maybe steal it all on the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had no &lt;em>idea&lt;/em> how to top that&amp;hellip; but was curious to see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out&amp;hellip; time travel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a risky choice. Time travel at a small scale can be a lot of fun. It helps you pull off heists after all. And yet&amp;hellip; when you try to make it significantly larger, you really have to deal with the question: how does time travel work in this universe?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s never &lt;em>entirely&lt;/em> answered. Things get all sorts of quantum and fuzzy. Effects proceed causes (and sometimes you get neat little loops with no original cause at all). Other than that, I&amp;rsquo;ll let you see how they deal with it all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do still love the side characters the most. We get more Scarecrow, which is fascinating. And of course Stills and anti-piss (you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to see it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, the first book is stronger. But this one has some fascinating ideas and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to get the chance to live in this world for just a few hours longer. Onward to see if it can be done&amp;ndash;one more time. ðŸ˜„&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Quantum Magician</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/04/14/the-quantum-magician/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/04/14/the-quantum-magician/</guid><description>A con man called Gander had once taught him that there were only three bets. Sometimes, you play the cards. Sometimes, you play the player. Sometimes, you just throw the dice.
The Quantum Magician is &amp;hellip; not what I expected. I&amp;rsquo;m sure at one point, I read the blurb, but I&amp;rsquo;ve slept since then. So all I had to go on when I picked it up just now was the title.</description></item></channel></rss>
