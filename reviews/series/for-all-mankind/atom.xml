And all caught up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4th and last (as of my watching) final season of For All Mankind sees humanity not only surviving, but THRIVING on Mars, beginning to reach out into other smaller bodies for resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s kind of awesome and kind of depressing, to see where the writers think humanity could have been. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a bit wishful, but still. If only&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, things are, of course, not at all rosy. We have some major issues with class divisions, yet more tensions between the US and (still surviving) USSR, and the mess that is the North Koreans landing first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s quite a lot of drama and a world I love to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to season 5 if (hopefully when) we get it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>For All Mankind: Season 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/15/for-all-mankind-season-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/15/for-all-mankind-season-3/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;To MARS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s great seeing how the world is diverging from our own, with another Great Space Race to MARS! This time, not just the US and USSR, but also the private sector (Helios) getting involved, which just manages to make everything more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even with some things so far ahead&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s still the (fictional) 90s. US/USSR tensions are still high. There are still plenty of hidden secrets just waiting to come out at the right moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we jump another decade forward, our original cast (those that have survived at least) are getting older, but still perfectly capable of causing all sorts of chaos. We have a few new faces as well, but I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, less than I expected. There&amp;rsquo;s no way that&amp;rsquo;s sustainable&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, another wonderful season. Man the reviews for this one makes it look worse than it is. It&amp;rsquo;s a show about the space race&amp;hellip; but not just about space. It&amp;rsquo;s also a show about the people &lt;em&gt;going to space&lt;/em&gt;, and some people miss that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite enjoyed it. Looking forward to season 4!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>For All Mankind: Season 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/05/28/for-all-mankind-season-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/05/28/for-all-mankind-season-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Well that got away from me for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the explosive introduction that was &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/for-all-mankind-season-1/"&gt;For All Mankind: Season 1&lt;/a&gt;, with the Soviets beating the US to the moon and all that changed through that&amp;hellip; no we&amp;rsquo;re a decade in the future and things &lt;em&gt;continue to change&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see Jamestown grow to a crew of around 20. The Baldwins have adapted a daughter. The chaos of escalating tensions, both on the moon and also back on Earth&amp;ndash;and all the perils of space travel, even without that. And Gordo, Danielle, and Ed, back to space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s all in the first part of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man this is a good show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And next season, with another time skip we may very well be going to Mars!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>For All Mankind: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/for-all-mankind-season-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/for-all-mankind-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Watched with someone that didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the show was about. A few minutes of &amp;ldquo;okay, so it&amp;rsquo;s about the moon landing.&amp;rdquo; And then the moment when he speaks&amp;hellip; Delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about &lt;strong&gt;STOP READING NOW AND GO WATCH THIS SHOW&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of an alternate history where the Soviets made it to the moon is so fascinating. And it&amp;rsquo;s only made all the better by all the character moments and (surprisingly to me) other historical events &lt;em&gt;not on the moon&lt;/em&gt; we see along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s such a good show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to what they do with Season 2. What changes&amp;hellip; and what stays the same?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
