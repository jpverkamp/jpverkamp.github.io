It&amp;rsquo;s really quite a good book, right up there with pretty much all of the rest of Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a neat magic system (as there always is)&amp;ndash;although this time around it felt a bit less detailed than Sanderson usually is. Usually even when as a reader doesn&amp;rsquo;t know all of the rules, you get the idea that there &lt;em>are&lt;/em> rules. This time, it just felt a bit more vague. I&amp;rsquo;m still unsure what exactly the color has to do with it, although the idea of magical automatons powered by souls (Breaths, whatever) is neat, if not quite as original as Sanderson often is. (It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that I&amp;rsquo;m also reading Mistborn at the moment.)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
