            &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sabriel is a wonderful book. Fantasy books dealing with death magic are among my favorites, the worldbuilding is fantastic (in the truest sense of the world), and the main characters are all a lot of fun. Each time I spend long enough without reading it, I always forget just how much I enjoy reading (or in this case listening too) this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worldbuilding is great. You don&amp;rsquo;t get the sense of mechanical precision you would get from someone like Sanderson, but it&amp;rsquo;s a world that feels both magical and &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo;, which is always something I&amp;rsquo;m looking for. In particular, the idea of a magical world and a WWIish era technological world, separated by a sometimes porous wall is a neat one. Even though it&amp;rsquo;s not an uncommon trope, I have yet to find a book that does it quite as well. Especially the eponymous Sabriel&amp;rsquo;s experience being born and of one kingdom, but raised in a boarding school and with the perspective of the other. I really want to know so much more than we&amp;rsquo;re given about this history of this world&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
