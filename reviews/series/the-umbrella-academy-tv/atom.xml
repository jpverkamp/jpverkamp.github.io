Out of one apocalypse and right into another. This time in the 1960s!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a neat concept and gives the characters a bit more time to grow&amp;ndash;while at the same time the viewers know there&amp;rsquo;s quite the timeline. And with time travel&amp;hellip; you can kill people off and still have to deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also instead of Hazel and Cha-Chat, you have three Swedish brothers (less amusing, far more terrifying).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quite enjoyed it. And there&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; of room left for Season 3. A quick search shows February 2022&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m going to go with a probably not on that. But still soon!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Umbrella Academy: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/17/the-umbrella-academy-season-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/17/the-umbrella-academy-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 12th hour of the first day of October 1989, 43 women around the world gave birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was unusual only in the fact that none of these women had been pregnant when the day first began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir Reginald Hargreeves, eccentric billionaire and adventurer, resolved to locate and adopt as many of the children as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh that&amp;rsquo;s quite a show. After &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/23/the-umbrella-academy-vol.-1-the-apocalypse-suite/"&gt;reading through the graphic novels&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s a rather different experience. The core is the same, even if details are a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colm Feore as Reginald Hargreeves is my favorite casting. He reminds me as Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym in Ant-Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward to season 2!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
