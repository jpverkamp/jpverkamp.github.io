            &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I finished Graceling, I really wanted to know more about Leks. In Fire, he showed up, even if it felt really weird and not really core to the story. Here&amp;hellip; we actually start to get just how twisted he really was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitterblue takes place roughly a decade after Graceling (and around 50 years after Fire), following the story of now ~20 year old Queen Bitterblue as she tries to untangle the absolute mess her father had made of the kingdom. Add into that a bit of a princess exploring her kingdom as a commoner trope, a bit of a romance subplot, and a sprinkling of&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;6137154&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6137154.fire&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/fire.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire is something of a bizarre &amp;lsquo;sequel&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s actually set chronologically before Graceling. For the most part, it&amp;rsquo;s set in a different part of the world, separated from the previously known seven kingdoms by an (almost) impassible mountain range. And with one exception&amp;ndash;that honestly doesn&amp;rsquo;t make that much sense&amp;ndash;there are no characters shared between the two books. Honestly, this joins the list of books that would have been much better had they not been marketed as a sequel or even being explicitly in the same world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some odd choices in the book that I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;3236307&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3236307.graceling&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/graceling.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed Graceling more than I actually expected to. It starts out slowly and ends a bit abruptly, but there was something about it that kept me going right to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plotwise, the story starts with main character Katsa kicking ass as a sort of enforcer for the King. She&amp;rsquo;s not thrilled with the idea, but what choice does she have? Halfway through the story, she meets Po and ends up running off to what feels like a completely different plotline (although to be fair, they are tangentially related by way of Po&amp;rsquo;s grandfather. They end up on the run from Mad King Bad Guy, cross some mountains&amp;hellip; and then the story sort of ends. It&amp;rsquo;s not a terrible story, but I felt like it was a bit light at times and tended to drop things without warning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
