                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Three-Body Problem is an interesting book. It was originally written in Chinese and won a whole pile of awards, earning lots of interesting ratings. That was enough to get me to put it on my list for this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the downside, I almost put the book down after the first 10%. It starts with historical backstory and even when the timeline advances to the present day, I still wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly caught up in the story. I very rarely read books without at least some sort of fantastical element to them and even a decent chunk into this book, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
