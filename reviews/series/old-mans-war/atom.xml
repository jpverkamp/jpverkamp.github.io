&lt;p>It definitely has a different feel to it than the rest of the Old Man&amp;rsquo;s War books, matching the idea that it was written by a teenage girl (having never been one, I can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee the accuracy, but it worked for me).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Last Colony</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/09/26/the-last-colony/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/09/26/the-last-colony/</guid><description>&lt;p>After John&amp;rsquo;s story in &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="51964" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51964.old-mans-war">Old Man&amp;#39;s War&lt;/a> and Jane&amp;rsquo;s (to some extent) in , this time around we get both of them. They&amp;rsquo;re together now and raising Zoë (how&amp;rsquo;s that for a complicated family), when they&amp;rsquo;re tapped to head an entirely new colony planet Roanoke&amp;ndash;with the first city named Croatoan. Also&amp;hellip; why would they even agree to that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean&amp;hellip; come on. Either no one knows the history behind the names&amp;ndash;in which case why in the world would they be using them&amp;ndash;or they do&amp;ndash;in which case why in the world would you choose &lt;em>that&lt;/em> to name your new colony. Granted, they turn out to want it to be lost, but still. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit annoying.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Ghost Brigades</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/09/08/the-ghost-brigades/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/09/08/the-ghost-brigades/</guid><description>&lt;p>After I read &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="51964" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51964.old-mans-war">Old Man&amp;#39;s War&lt;/a>, I went looking for the sequels. While on paper is the second in the series, it&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We get a lot more of a look into the CDF and specifically Special Forces, which was something that was interesting from the first book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Old Man's War</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/08/23/old-mans-war/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/08/23/old-mans-war/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I did two things on my seventy-fifth birthday. I visited my wife’s grave. Then I joined the army.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Fascinating.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
