If you enjoyed that story, you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy this one as well. If you read the &amp;lsquo;Binti Trilogy&amp;rsquo; binding all three, it fits as the conclusion to the story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Home</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/22/home/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/22/home/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Change was constant. Change was my destiny. Growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>After all the events of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/20/binti/">the first story&lt;/a>, Binti&amp;rsquo;s finally at Uni, learning about the magical sort of math that&amp;rsquo;s mostly been hinted at up until then&amp;ndash;and dealing with more than a touch of PTSD. So of course she decides to return home to her people for a pilgrimage&amp;ndash;and Okwu the Meduse will come along.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Nothing was asked of Okwu and Okwu was pleased, preferring to menacingly loom in the background behind me. Okwu was happiest around human beings when it was menacingly looming.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Binti</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/20/binti/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/20/binti/</guid><description>&lt;p>I quite enjoy this book. It&amp;rsquo;s got some fascinating worldbuilding, interesting characters. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit hampered by being a novella&amp;ndash;there are a few threads that I really could have used more of. Well worth the read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One warning: the story takes a turn towards the more &amp;lsquo;horror&amp;rsquo; (or at least thriller) side of sci-fi part of the way through. I was not expecting that&amp;ndash;I enjoy that sort of thing, but be warned if that&amp;rsquo;s not your sort of story.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
