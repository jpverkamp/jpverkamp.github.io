&lt;p>Cruel Beauty is a re-skinning of Beauty and the Beast, told in a weird, fantastic world with strong influences from ancient Greece and Rome. Among the retold fairy tales that I&amp;rsquo;ve read, it&amp;rsquo;s among the best of them and manages to feel reasonably like the inspiration story while adding a good number of weird twists and beautiful imagery on top of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Honestly, the strongest part of the story for me was the world. It seems that a chunk of reality was torn from what could have been our world and set aside, with a sky that looks like parchment and demons that literally roam the land, making deals. There&amp;rsquo;s a castle chock full of magical rooms and artifacts that are all sorts of cool, even when they&amp;rsquo;re just used as background for a single scene. It&amp;rsquo;s the sort of world I would absolutely love to explore in a more freeform style (virtual reality?) someday and the author does an excellent job of bringing it all to life and making it feel real.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
