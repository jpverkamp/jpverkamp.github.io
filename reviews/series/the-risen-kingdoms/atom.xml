This time we have a (aero)nautical adventure with skyships, pirates, lost treasures, and found families. Really, it&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful exploration of just how wonderful and strange the world we&amp;rsquo;ve been allowed to inhabit for just a little while.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Labyrinth of Scions and Sorcery</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/04/a-labyrinth-of-scions-and-sorcery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/04/a-labyrinth-of-scions-and-sorcery/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/08/an-alchemy-of-masques-and-mirrors/">An Alchemy of Masques and Mirrors&lt;/a> was a delightful surprise of a book, with unique/excellent worldbuilding, fun characters, great wordsmithing, and a solid mystery of a plot. A Labyrinth of Scions and Sorcery has all three once again, although we mostly lose the mystery of the of first book and get a bunch of politics instead. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, it&amp;rsquo;s still great, it just took me a bit to get into the tonal shift.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An Alchemy of Masques and Mirrors</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/08/an-alchemy-of-masques-and-mirrors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/08/an-alchemy-of-masques-and-mirrors/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that was delightful. One of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;m really glad for the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/lists/2021-book-bingo/">2021 Book Bingo&lt;/a>. I don&amp;rsquo;t know when/if I would have found this book, if not for that, and I really quite enjoyed it. It&amp;rsquo;s got great steampunky worldbuilding (with some hints of body horror I honestly feel steampunk should probably have more of), royal/courtly intrigue, wonderful characters, and some delightful writing (with a French twist to the word choices that I don&amp;rsquo;t see much of). Well worth the read and I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely going to see where this story goes next.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
