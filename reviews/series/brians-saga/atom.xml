&lt;p>Derek shook his head. “Not exactly. Bill and Erik are instructors, but I’m a psychologist. We work with people who may need to survive in bad situations—you know, like downed pilots, astronauts, soldiers. How to live off the land and get out safely.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“What do you want with me?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>”Derek smiled. “You can probably guess. . . .”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brian shook his head.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Well, to make it short, we want you to do it again.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so it went!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s pretty much the idea. Brian is adjusting well enough, but still dreams of the wilderness. And now he has a chance to go back, so of course he does!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time, with another along (ish), knives instead of a hatchet, and to a different lake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, things have to go wrong&amp;hellip; And this time Brian finds himself needing to make a raft and go down the titular River to get help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting enough story, but I feel like there wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite as much there are in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/12/22/hatchet/">Hatchet&lt;/a>? I&amp;rsquo;m curious what the rest have in store.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hatchet</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/12/22/hatchet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/12/22/hatchet/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Patience, he thought. So much of this was patience - waiting, and thinking and doing things right. So much of all this, so much of all living was patience and thinking.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a book about patience.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>He had to keep thinking of them because if he forgot them and did not think of them they might forget about him. And he had to keep hoping.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And hope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And hunger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And fire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And survival.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a quick read&amp;ndash;and it&amp;rsquo;s probably been 20 years since I last read it, so I figured I would give it another chance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not a bad book. It feels visceral at times, really making you aware of Brian. And knowing that&amp;ndash;because it&amp;rsquo;s that sort of book&amp;ndash;he has to survive at the end, you always have hope. Even if some of those situations are &lt;em>so ridiculous&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now, apparently, there are &lt;em>4&lt;/em> sequels? How in the world are they going to do that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
