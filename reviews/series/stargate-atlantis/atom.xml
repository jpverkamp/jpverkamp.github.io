&lt;p&gt;I do sorely wish that Atlantis could have gotten another season. There are some &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; strong episodes in this seaon. As much as I liked Weir and Carter, Woolsey is another huge case of character improvement (almost as much as McKay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mini-reviews (potential spoilers):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Search and Rescue&lt;/em&gt;: Half a closed room, buried deep in a collapsed building, half Teyla. Neither quite what I was hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Stargate Atlantis: Season 4</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/09/10/stargate-atlantis-season-4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/09/10/stargate-atlantis-season-4/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a crazy season in how it begins (lost in space!) and ends (lost in time!). More replicators, more wraith, more variations thereof. A handful of smaller episodes with only small combinations of main cast really shine. We lose a few of the big leads and gain a few more old names. It&amp;rsquo;s also always interesting how shows deal with the pregnancy of a main cast member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onwards and Season 5-wards! To the end.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Stargate Atlantis: Season 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/24/stargate-atlantis-season-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/24/stargate-atlantis-season-3/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to like in this series. We get new, complicate Wraith threats (Michael and Todd!), Replicators, lost Ancients, and some of the best McKay episodes in the show (McKay and Mrs. Miller and Tao of Rodney). Not to mention Lucius Lavin. No really. :) And then there&amp;rsquo;s Sunday&amp;hellip; Man it sucks to kill off major characters just to raise the stakes, but it still works as an episode.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Stargate Atlantis: Season 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/09/stargate-atlantis-season-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/09/stargate-atlantis-season-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Well that&amp;rsquo;s quite a beginning and ending, with a whole lot in between. One of the biggest changes is the introduction of Ronan Dex. Replacement for Lt. Ford who has a tendency to shoot first and ask questions&amp;ndash;well, never. He&amp;rsquo;s quite the character and a good addition to the team. Interesting that the main team is half from Pegasus now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mini-reviews (potential spoilers):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Siege, Part 3: Man this is a fun three parter. I don’t care as much for the repeated theme of military taking over, but it is still a great episode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intruder: Computer virus running the show. we’ve done this before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runner: Ford’s passing of the torch to Ronon Dex. Ford never quite works and I really end up liking Dex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duet: Two minds stuck in McKay’s body. A story we’ve seen before, but I really like in particular how it humanizes him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Condemned: Penal colony/execution and overzealous laws. Again, we’ve done it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trinity: McKay discovers a super weapon research station and he believes he can fix it better than the Ancients. The hubris of McKay is a great contrast to Duet and I b really enjoy the relationship between Sheppard and McKay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instinct: The first hints that it may be possible to &amp;lsquo;cure&amp;rsquo; the Wraith. Also Jewel Staite, which is amusing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversion: Fallout from Instinct leads to a return of Iratus bugs (Sheppard is thrilled).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aurora: Ancients! Virtual reality! a fascinating episode and a poignant ending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lost Boys: Highs to lows. Ford is back and still… questionable at best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hive: Teyla is Wraith-psychic. Sheppard falls for any pretty face. Cool action scenes though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epiphany: Time dilation! The way to fit a lifetime in an episode. A lot like Brief Candle from SG-1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Critical Mass: Crossover, chock full of mostly minor characters from SG-1! It&amp;rsquo;s interesting watching them out of order, since the Ori aren&amp;rsquo;t about yet. The Twilight Bark analogy falling flat to a room full of SGC is hilarious. Cadman back is great. Wish she has a bigger roll over all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grace Under Pressure: McKay stuck in a jumper deep in the ocean, hallucinating. One of the best McKay episodes in the show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Tower: Of course the Ancients had more cities. And of course Sheppard&amp;rsquo;s, &amp;ldquo;I never see this coming&amp;rdquo;. An interesting exploration of what the ancients left behind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael: I remember watching this the first time and feeling something was vaguely wrong from the beginning. Knowing just what that is just means that I can be on the look out for it the whole way through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inferno: The Ancients were really good at finding creative ways to harness huge amounts of power. It&amp;rsquo;s amusing how often they tend to explode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allies: The enemy of my enemy&amp;hellip; Should damn will still be my enemy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to Season 3! Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m glad to be watching these now and not having to wait a year or more for the &amp;lsquo;To Be Continued&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Stargate Atlantis: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/29/stargate-atlantis-season-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/29/stargate-atlantis-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;And so it begins again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Stargate SG-1 really has a solid place in my heart, in a way I like Atlantis even better. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it could have been what it is without SG-1, but with it, it&amp;rsquo;s made even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a generally optimistic can do attitude, backed up by McKay quite often saving the day (which is crazy coming off SG-1, I forgot how annoying he is and just &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; he grows throughout the seasons of Atlantis). On top of that, the second weird (Torri Higginson) is back as the woman in charge and plays that well. I think perhaps my favorite character though (if not McKay, I know right?) is Joe Flanigan as Lt. Colonel John Sheppard. He&amp;rsquo;s a military leader that cares more for his people than for the rules (seen that before), but he&amp;rsquo;s smart (although he keeps it low key) and snarky rather than cynical as Jack could be. It&amp;rsquo;s a good mix. Teyla&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve never quite cared for, but she&amp;rsquo;s portrayed well enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
