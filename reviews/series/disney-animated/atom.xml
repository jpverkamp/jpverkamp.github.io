It just wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of the Disney movies we ever had.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which is a bit of a bummer, since that&amp;rsquo;s quite a good time! Better late than never though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lady and the Tramp</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/07/lady-and-the-tramp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/07/lady-and-the-tramp/</guid><description>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a cute little movie. I think if you&amp;rsquo;re going to do the dog thing, I would strongly prefer {{crosslink &amp;ldquo;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&amp;rdquo;}}. Better music, decent story. Could be that I watched the latter far more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But characterwise, I did enjoy the contrast between the titular Lady and the Tramp and it&amp;rsquo;s a nice enough story. Stylistically, I enjoy the city and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to not really see the human characters (it&amp;rsquo;s a dog movie after all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/12/snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/12/snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs/</guid><description>&lt;p>An almost 100 year old movie, based on a story likely at least a century older, combining aspects of stories who knows how old, animated for the modern (of the time) movie going audience. It&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of a truely delightful era&amp;ndash;that of the Disney animated classics. While they&amp;rsquo;ve certainly got their problems (the rather traditional gender roles and Disney&amp;rsquo;s ongoing copyright battles to name a pair), they&amp;rsquo;re still something elegant and innocent about them and Snow White is no exception.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pocahontas</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/07/pocahontas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/07/pocahontas/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of my favorites of the Disney animated classics. It&amp;rsquo;s a straight forward enough story that at least takes some pains to show the terrible way that European settlers treated Native Americans and shows that people are people and will often try to do the right thing, given a chance. The music is wonderful and the animation is really quite something that up even today.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Encanto</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/13/encanto/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/13/encanto/</guid><description>&lt;p>Disney has really been doing quite well the last 12 years. Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6, Moana, and now Encanto? (I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen Raya yet) All really solid films. Encanto specifically, I really enjoyed. It&amp;rsquo;s got great songs, fun characters, beautiful animation, and a lovely story. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to see a story based on yet another culture&amp;ndash;Columbia this time&amp;ndash;Disney is really doing that well. Overall, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t quite put it to the level of Moana, but it&amp;rsquo;s just about there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bambi</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/27/bambi/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/27/bambi/</guid><description>&lt;p>Bambi is a surprisingly tricky movie to review, mostly since it relies on who&amp;rsquo;s doing the reviewing. From my perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s cute enough, but there&amp;rsquo;s next to nothing there. It&amp;rsquo;s just a bunch of cute animated animals running around for an hour. From my kids&amp;rsquo; perspectives though&amp;hellip; they loved it. They were laughing out loud at the cartoon antics and cuddled right in during the storm and hunt scenes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a fun enough movie for kids to watch, but I think next time they request it, I&amp;rsquo;ll find something else to do with my time. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/13/the-many-adventures-of-winnie-the-pooh/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/13/the-many-adventures-of-winnie-the-pooh/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is just delightful&amp;ndash;and a blast of nostalgia on top of that. I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to actually watch all of the Disney classic growing up (still haven&amp;rsquo;t), but I definiately watched this one. And now, after reading many of the stories to my children, it&amp;rsquo;s a delight to be able to share the video form with them as well!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really like the style of these stories. It&amp;rsquo;s a mix of animated world with the real storybook characters (Pooh et al), but also obviously in a book, as they hob from page to page. It&amp;rsquo;s not the story of style you&amp;rsquo;d always expect to work, but it really works here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>One Hundred and One Dalmatians</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/30/one-hundred-and-one-dalmatians/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/30/one-hundred-and-one-dalmatians/</guid><description>&lt;p>60 years ago. Dang. And you know? It holds up. The action is solid and story aren&amp;rsquo;t overly complicated but enjoyable, the animation really works (despite/because of the limitations of the time), and the villains are unambiguous and scary but not overly so. Perhaps best of all, it&amp;rsquo;s the story of an absolute pile of talking dogs. What&amp;rsquo;s not to love?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Rescuers Down Under</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/17/the-rescuers-down-under/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/17/the-rescuers-down-under/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s an absolute blast of childhood nostalgia. We had this movie on VHS when I was little and I remember watching the heck out of it, although I haven&amp;rsquo;t otherwise seen it in decades now. Truth be told, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until recently that I realized it was even a sequel&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case. The Rescuers (Down Under) is the story of a worldwide society of mice that take it upon themselves to rescue human children in need of help. It&amp;rsquo;s a nutty premise, but just go with it. This time around, it&amp;rsquo;s a boy kidnapped in the Australian outback (with a wonderfully over the top poacher as the villain) and somehow the team they send are two mice from&amp;hellip; New York? There&amp;rsquo;s no one else closer? Only two? Anyways, they have to go rescue the boy, there are a few tense moments, a lot of adventure, and in the end the villain is defeated and the boy goes home free. It&amp;rsquo;s got a number of tense moments&amp;ndash;more than I remember truth be told&amp;ndash;and my younger viewers needed a bit of attention through a few points. But I think they enjoyed it well enough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moana</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/20/moana/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Mar 2021 00:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/20/moana/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>ðŸŽµ You&amp;rsquo;re welcome. ðŸŽµ&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Man, that&amp;rsquo;s a fun movie.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Frozen</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/12/28/frozen/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/12/28/frozen/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whoa.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was not at all what the trailers hinted at.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
