&lt;p&gt;Good-bye and hello, as always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. Oberon is back. Things are still going wrong. The Pattern is breaking apart and Brand / the Courts of Chaos are trying to hurry things along.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Hand of Oberon</title>

&lt;p&gt;Heredity or environment? I wondered wryly. We were all of us, to some degree, mad after his fashion. To be honest, it had to be a form of madness, to have so much and to strive so bitterly for just a little more, for a bit of an edge over the others. He carried this tendency to its extreme, that is all. He was a caricature of this mania in all of us. In this sense, did it really matter which of us was the traitor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around, Corwin et all go to the Primal Pattern (because that&amp;rsquo;s a thing now) and manage to figure out what could have caused the Black Road and all the troubles that&amp;rsquo;s been causing them. We proceed to get a pile more backstory / world building from Dworkin (  &lt;span class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;Who is apparently Corwin&#39;s grandfather?&lt;/span&gt;
  ) and head off for some funâ„¢ in the Courts of Chaos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sign of the Unicorn</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In , Corwin went from having no memories to learning he was a Prince of Amber, to trying to wrest the throne from his brother Eric&amp;ndash;only to be blinded and thrown into prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In , Corwin escapes off the Avalon in order to use jewelers&#39; supplies to make guns to take back the throne from Eric&amp;ndash;only to end up having to save Amber rather than attack it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Guns of Avalon</title>

&lt;p&gt;Now I had to find a place, a place resembling another place &amp;ndash; one which no longer existed. I located the path. I took it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In  , Corwin attacked his brother Eric in Amber. He lost and was blinded and thrown in prison. Conveniently,  &lt;span class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;Princes of Amber have a remarkable ability to heal&lt;/span&gt;
  . On top of that,  &lt;span class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;Dworkin (who created the Trumps and knows more about the Pattern than probably anyone) just so happens to be locked up as well and pops into his cell.&lt;/span&gt;
  . One thing leads to another, and Corwin is free. Of course he wants to take another crack at the throne. How though?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nine Princes in Amber</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started The Chronicles of Amber, I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what I expected. Probably a straight forward fantasy epic a la The Lord of the Rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
