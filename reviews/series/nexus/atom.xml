&lt;p>A solid conclusion to the Nexus trilogy. Some things go exactly as I expected them to, but there are still a fair few surprises thrown in for good measure. For the most part, a lot of loose ends are tied up, making it a good way to end a series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The stakes go up with most of the world in turmoil, the US and China in particular. The Chinese part was interesting (particularly since I&amp;rsquo;ve spent some time studying how the Chinese censorship systems work in the modern day), but felt tonally rather different from the previous books. It vaguely fits, but it felt almost like half a sequel and half something entirely new.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crux</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/24/crux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/24/crux/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>Crux basically picks up where Nexus let off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nexus is a force in the world, with more than a million people using it, growing every day. One particularly interesting use is giving Nexus to children with autism to allow them to communicate directly mind to mind. Another is the children that were born to parents using Nexus. Interesting in both cases.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nexus</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/03/24/nexus/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/03/24/nexus/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve read near future science fiction that wasn&amp;rsquo;t overly apocalyptic. This was a good re-introduction thereto.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, we&amp;rsquo;re a few decades in the future. Genemods and other biotechnology are known and not entirely uncommon. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure such technology will actually be available in only 25 years, but it would be interesting to live in a world where such things have come to be.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
