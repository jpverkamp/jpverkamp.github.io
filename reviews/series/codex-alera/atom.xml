&lt;p>Life, Tavi reflected, seldom makes a gift of what one expects or plans for.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s darkest before the dawn.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Princeps' Fury</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/01/30/princeps-fury/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/01/30/princeps-fury/</guid><description>&lt;p>Compared to the previous books, changes focus somewhat. For the first time, we&amp;rsquo;re not actually focussed solely around Alera and the domain and battles of the humans. Instead, we&amp;rsquo;re going to Canim where unfortunately &lt;span class="spoiler">the Vord have taken over nearly anything&lt;/span>
. It&amp;rsquo;s a neat change of focus and a crazy escalation of stakes&amp;ndash;although admittedly not unexpected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The parts with Tavi are pretty wonderful. He&amp;rsquo;s really likeable and does a great job of overcoming problems by outthinking them, even now that he&amp;rsquo;s actually coming into powers of his own. It&amp;rsquo;s almost unbelievable just how good he is at planning, but he&amp;rsquo;s the protagonist. It works.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Captain's Fury</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/01/23/captains-fury/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/01/23/captains-fury/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="346087" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/346087.captains-fury"> Captain&amp;#39;s Fury &lt;/a> takes the &amp;lsquo;Alera at war&amp;rsquo; feel of &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="29394" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29394.cursors-fury"> Cursor&amp;#39;s Fury &lt;/a> and really turns it up a notch. Tavi has done the impossible and fought a war against the Canim for two years now, holding them in place and building the trust of his followers to impressive levels. But now a new foe is coming for him&amp;ndash;a foe far more terrifying than the Canim, or even than the Vord (who are much less interesting when you don&amp;rsquo;t see them on screen for a book or two)&amp;hellip; politicians.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, Tavi remains among the best part of these books:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cursor's Fury</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/01/14/cursors-fury/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/01/14/cursors-fury/</guid><description>&lt;p>Were &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="29396" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29396.furies-of-calderon">Furies of Calderon&lt;/a> introduced us to the world and the Marat and &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="133664" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133664.academs-fury">Academ&amp;#39;s Fury&lt;/a> gave us a taste of the politics of Alera along with the threat of the Vord, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="29394" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29394.cursors-fury">Cursor&amp;#39;s Fury&lt;/a> where we really shift to the military focus that defines the rest of the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A civil war in Alera plus an invasion by the Canim? Oy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Academ's Fury</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/01/03/academs-fury/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/01/03/academs-fury/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="29396" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29396.furies-of-calderon">Furies of Calderon&lt;/a> felt like fairly standard high fantasy. It had a Roman theme rather than the more common (in what I&amp;rsquo;ve read) Medieval European and elemental spirits for a magical theme, but it still had a fairly standard &amp;lsquo;farmboy saves the day through strength of character and good triumphs over evil&amp;rsquo; sort of theme. There were hints of a wider world, but for the most part, it was a fairly self contained book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="133664" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133664.academs-fury">Academ&amp;#39;s Fury&lt;/a> takes all that and really starts to dig into the world building and expand the scope of the conflict. Where we only had the hints of &amp;lsquo;weird&amp;rsquo; in the Wax Forest, now we have a fully developed and quite frankly terrifying threat in the Vord. While it&amp;rsquo;s not the most original concept (the Borg among many many others), it&amp;rsquo;s well done here. You really get a sense for how alien the Vord are and&amp;ndash;worst&amp;ndash;how smart. They learn and they won&amp;rsquo;t stop until everything is Vord. Also, the Canim. Warrior wolf people. Pretty cool.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Furies of Calderon</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/12/29/furies-of-calderon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/12/29/furies-of-calderon/</guid><description>&lt;p>Apparently I last read Furies of Calderon before I started writing reviews. That was actually the second time I read it&amp;ndash;the first time I didn&amp;rsquo;t even finish the book, putting it down. It&amp;rsquo;s something of a slow book and a bit strange. But the second time and especially once I got into the sequels, I loved it, it&amp;rsquo;s among my favorite series. This time around, I listened to it and it&amp;rsquo;s even better as an audiobook (since it just keeps right on going through the boring parts).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, the story is that Codex Alera arose out of a bar bet. Take some random topic and write a story about it. In this case, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legio_IX_Hispana">Lost Roman Legion&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokemon">Pokemon&lt;/a>. Sounds crazy, but it kind of works. From the Roman half, you end up with essentially a Roman empire with holds and legions that have fought to tear out a land for themselves from a variety of enemies all around. From the Pokemon, you have Furies, elemental spirits of the land, sea, and air which all of the Alerans[^Tavi] have some ability to control for various tasks: the strength of an earth fury, healing with water furies, flying with air. Pretty cool.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
