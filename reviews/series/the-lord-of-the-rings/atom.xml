&lt;p>There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t really need to review the Hobbit. It&amp;rsquo;s a delightful book and you&amp;rsquo;ve probably already read it. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t, you should.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I can do though is &lt;em>highly&lt;/em> HIGHLY recommend listening to the audiobook narrated by Andy Serkis (the voice of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies). Oh, he&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>good&lt;/em>. And not just as Gollum, but as everyone.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to find anyone.'&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I should think so â€” in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!&lt;/p>
