      <description>For some reason, I Iron Man 3 as a fairly week entry, but looking back to when I last watched it in theaters&amp;hellip; I actually liked it about as much then I do now.
On one hand, I really do still think they absolutely nailed Robert Downey Jr. as Iron man. He can do both funny and broken pretty well and has more than a few chances for each this time around.</description>
