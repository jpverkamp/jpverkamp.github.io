A chance to get out of Area X and explore the organization sending people in / to their deaths over and over again&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get into it. I missed the limited focus and the mystery of the first book. Even, for what very little we knew about them, the characters.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Annihilation</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/01/annihilation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/01/annihilation/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must understand how I felt then, how the surveyor must have felt: We were scientists, trained to observe natural phenomena and the results of human activity. We had not been trained to encounter what appeared to be the uncanny. In unusual situations there can be a comfort in the presence of even someone you think might be your enemy. Now we had come close to the edges of something unprecedented, and less than a week into our mission we had lost not just the linguist at the border but our anthropologist and our psychologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that is a fascinating sort of book. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a slice of life mixed with cosmic horror. The entire story follows an expedition into the mysterious, alien Area X. There&amp;rsquo;s not really any overarching plot, other than exploring and perhaps surviving&amp;hellip; and maybe if you&amp;rsquo;re really really lucky, coming back without going mad.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
