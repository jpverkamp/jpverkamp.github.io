&lt;p&gt;You must understand how I felt then, how the surveyor must have felt: We &amp;gt; were scientists, trained to observe natural phenomena and the results of &amp;gt; human activity. We had not been trained to encounter what appeared to be the &amp;gt; uncanny. In unusual situations there can be a comfort in the presence of &amp;gt; even someone you think might be your enemy. Now we had come close to the &amp;gt; edges of something unprecedented, and less than a week into our mission we &amp;gt; had lost not just the linguist at the border but our anthropologist and our &amp;gt; psychologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that is a fascinating sort of book. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a slice of life mixed with cosmic horror. The entire story follows an expedition into the mysterious, alien Area X. There&amp;rsquo;s not really any overarching plot, other than exploring and perhaps surviving&amp;hellip; and maybe if you&amp;rsquo;re really really lucky, coming back without going mad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
