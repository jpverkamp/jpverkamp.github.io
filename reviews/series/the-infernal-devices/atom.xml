But &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/21/clockwork-princess/">Clockwork Princess&lt;/a> is quite a bit better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In one book, we have big battles, a conclusion to the automaton plotline, an actual resolution to the love triangle (I&amp;rsquo;ll come back to this), more politics, and answers for just what Tessa actually is and what that means for the greater universe. I can&amp;rsquo;t really think of anything in particular that I particularly would have wanted that was missing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clockwork Prince</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/06/clockwork-prince/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/06/clockwork-prince/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We live and breathe words. &amp;hellip;. It was books that made me feel that perhaps I was not completely alone. They could be honest with me, and I with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% sure why I finished this book. But I suppose that having finished it at all might just be a testament to &amp;hellip; something?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clockwork Angel</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/02/15/clockwork-angel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/02/15/clockwork-angel/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“One must always be careful of books,&amp;quot; said Tessa, &amp;ldquo;and what is inside them,
for words have the power to change us.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been rather a while since I read City of Bones&amp;ndash;long enough that it was before I actually started writing reviews. And long enough that I only barely remember what happened in those other books. I do vaguely remember the world building being an interesting enough take on urban fantasy &amp;ndash;I have a personal love of books dealing with angels and half angels&amp;ndash; surrounding an otherwise interesting enough plot.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
