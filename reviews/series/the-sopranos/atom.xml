      <description>Man that was another season. Ralphie is a great character to love to hate, Christopher is really having some drug issues, and things really come to a head between Tony and Carmela. A great season and I look forward to the next.

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an odd season. The original plotline had to be thrown out on account of the actress that played Tony&#39;s mom dying , so the whole &amp;lsquo;do they have a case against Tony&amp;rsquo; thing falls through. As a result, it&amp;rsquo;s not the most cohesive of seasons, but there are a few gems in here still.

      <description>Man this show just keeps going.
They actually lowered the amount of nudity a bit from Season 1 (as HBO tends to do), but the violence is still going strong… It’s fascinating (and solid writing) to see the fall out from the big events of season 1, along with entirely new plotlines with Janice (Tony’s brother), Richard Aprile (who’s got crazy eyes), Christopher really getting into (and out of) writing, and drama with the entire Soprano family/children.</description>

      <description>After the crazy violence and nudity of Watchmen, you&amp;rsquo;d think perhaps we&amp;rsquo;d go for something a little more &amp;hellip; safe for next time around.
Nah.
The Sopranos.
It&amp;rsquo;s one of the best rated TV shows of all time (on IMDb, only Breaking Bad (which I watched just before I started reviewing TV series), Avatar: The Last Airbender (it&amp;rsquo;s great), and Game of Thrones (pre Season 8) are rated higher among fiction).</description>
