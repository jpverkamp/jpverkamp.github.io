They certainly turned &lt;em>that&lt;/em> up a notch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right at the end of Season 1, the innies get a chance to go out. This could not &lt;em>possibly&lt;/em> go well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except apparently all is well in the world?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have drama, both innie and outie and mixed. We have goats. We have sex scenes. We have wives cheating with their own husbands. We have a trip into the woods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we have a marching band.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I quite enjoyed this show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now I have to wait for season 3!!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Severance: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/25/severance-season-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/25/severance-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, that&amp;rsquo;s quite a show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first glance, the idea is appealing. You split your memories so that you can go to work, get paid, and essentially spend your entire life &lt;em>not at work&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But then you start to think about this other you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They never leave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They never sleep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They never have a life outside of work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;ndash;is terrifying enough even before you start getting into the whole cult&amp;rsquo;y aspects. And the hallways. And the goats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have no idea where they&amp;rsquo;re going&amp;ndash;(I hope they know)&amp;ndash;but I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
