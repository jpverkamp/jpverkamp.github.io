The lives we lived fall away from us, but something remains, something that is part of the tree.
That one actually took me rather a while to get through. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, the worldbuilding is still facinating, the action is top notch, and we still get more than a bunch of all the main characters. But somehow&amp;ndash;it seems to have lost it&amp;rsquo;s focus.</description></item><item><title>Grey Sister</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/21/grey-sister/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/21/grey-sister/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">
