lol.
And then of course, as these things do everything escalated. Harry/Lizard. Venom. Mr. Murderhands.
All the chaos!
The main Spider-Gwen storyline was getting a bit weak there, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see this as a return to form. I&amp;rsquo;m really curious what happens next here.
Onward!</description></item><item><title>Spider-Man/Spider-Gwen: Sitting in a Tree</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/24/spider-man/spider-gwen-sitting-in-a-tree/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/24/spider-man/spider-gwen-sitting-in-a-tree/</guid><description>My thoughts exactly.
Issues 16 and 17 of Spider-Gwen are apparently a crossover with Spider-Man… so here we go?
Of course we go right from the above to “Miles’ dad is missing”, so I’m not entirely sure this is going to be a helpful aside for Spider-Gwen. We shall see!
… seriously?
I have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s going on with that&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave that one for another day.</description></item><item><title>Spider-Gwen, Vol. 3: Long-Distance</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/23/spider-gwen-vol.-3-long-distance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/23/spider-gwen-vol.-3-long-distance/</guid><description>&lt;p>The ongoing developments of Spider-Gwen and this universe’s Matt Murdoch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m intrigued!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then we get an annual made of a bunch of random stories. Cute enough. But… I want the main storyline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The All New Wolverine body swap was a lot of fun though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Gwen, Vol. 2: Weapon of Choice</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/20/spider-gwen-vol.-2-weapon-of-choice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/20/spider-gwen-vol.-2-weapon-of-choice/</guid><description>&lt;p>And&amp;hellip; after &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/18/spider-women/">Spider-Women&lt;/a>, we&amp;rsquo;re back!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two (ish) volumes in and we already have the crisis of faith/lost powers one. Whee!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Kraven no less. Such an odd villain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time running out for Gwen, Castle on her tail—and on the edge it seems—and Captain Stacy has a solution. Luckily, Gwen made friends with… Reed Richards?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intense. Curious how long this lasts.&lt;/p>

Coming soon to an Earth-65 near you.
Also, that’s certainly an art style. It’s jarring in most crossovers but even more so in this one for some reason.
Anyways.
The idea of Jessica Drew’s alternate Agent Drew being a man is somewhat amusing, given her Ultimate version.
It’s fascinating to see someone so potentially character defining to Spider-Gwen—like losing her powers! —be in a crossover story.
I missed this as I was first planning&amp;hellip; Glad I went back and caught it, kind of important that one.</description></item><item><title>Spider-Gwen, Vol. 1: Greater Power</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/17/spider-gwen-vol.-1-greater-power/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/17/spider-gwen-vol.-1-greater-power/</guid><description>&lt;p>When worlds collide…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/spider-gwen-2015-v1-textbundle-eeebab.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this universe, Peter Parker wanted to be a hero and got killed for it. So… why is the Lizard apparently still running around?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, the Green Goblin!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much in this world built around a the severe ‘not what it looks like’ of Peter’s death. Strains incredulity… but that’s comics. And it (so far) is working for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The introduction of this world’s Captain America was fun. I appreciate the quick backstory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Likewise Harry Osborne. Dungeons and Dragons nerds unite!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m enjoying this series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Gwen, Vol. 0: Most Wanted?</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/16/spider-gwen-vol.-0-most-wanted/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/16/spider-gwen-vol.-0-most-wanted/</guid><description>&lt;p>It’s been a minute. Let’s read some Spider-Gwen. A Reddit post has a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpiderGwen/s/F0Ml2g31iH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reading order&lt;/a>. Man comics are complicated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here we have Spider-Gwen. An alternate Spider Gwen Stacy! Her dad’s a cop (hunting her) and life is complicated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have a small pile of villains—mostly a Vulture, but also Kingpin, Frank Castle, and Matt Murdoch. Ambiguous at both. I’m curious where it goes from here!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit of a chaotic start, but I’m looking forward to it!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
