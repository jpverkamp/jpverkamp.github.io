&lt;p>That being said, this story is a bit crazy. It introduces &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puck_%5c%28folklore%5c%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puck&lt;/a> , a character I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed the idea of. The English version of Coyote or Loki essentially. And apparently&amp;hellip; he&amp;rsquo;s a badass wild Fae that can go toe to toe with Lea (under certain conditions)? Sure!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dog Men (Graphic Novel)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/23/dog-men-graphic-novel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/23/dog-men-graphic-novel/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There are two wolves within every man&amp;hellip; One represents our greatest capacities&amp;ndash;compassion, courage, reason. The other embodies our base emotions &amp;ndash;pride, anger, hatred. At every moment of every day, they battle for control of us. But it is we who determine which one win.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just depends on which one you feed&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t great, but we get a lot more of Molly in her apprentice level, which I feel was somewhat skipped over in the novels.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>War Cry (Graphic Novel)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/16/war-cry-graphic-novel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/16/war-cry-graphic-novel/</guid><description>&lt;p>War Cry! The second new Dresden comic!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It almost feels like a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle_episode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bottle episode&lt;/a> in that it&amp;rsquo;s very limited in scope, but the action and explosions certainly would have cost a fair penny. There&amp;rsquo;s something underhanded going on, an attack by hundreds of red court vampires, and Dresden coming into his role as a mentor warden. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ghoul Goblin (Graphic Novel)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/13/ghoul-goblin-graphic-novel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/13/ghoul-goblin-graphic-novel/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/03/welcome-to-the-jungle-graphic-novel/">Welcome to the Jungle&lt;/a> was new, but an introduction. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/08/storm-front-graphic-novel/">Storm Front (Graphic Novel)&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/10/fool-moon-graphic-novel/">Fool Moon (Graphic Novel)&lt;/a> are adaptations of previous works I&amp;rsquo;ve read a number of times. But &lt;em>Ghoul Goblin&lt;/em>? NEW CONTENT!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting seeing introductions over and over again. I know the books do the same, but for some reason it feels different in a comic. Perhaps because I&amp;rsquo;m reading them relatively quickly?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fool Moon (Graphic Novel)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/10/fool-moon-graphic-novel/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/10/fool-moon-graphic-novel/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/02/19/fool-moon/">Fool Moon&lt;/a>, but as a comic book/graphic novel!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s one of two novel adaptations (Storm Front being the other) and I think the weaker of the two. Still a lot of fun though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Storm Front (Graphic Novel)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/08/storm-front-graphic-novel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/08/storm-front-graphic-novel/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s two parts but I think that&amp;rsquo;s totally just a binding/printing thing. The story isn&amp;rsquo;t really broken up any differently than the novel already was or than the individual issues that make it up have to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All together: it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/02/16/storm-front/">Storm Front&lt;/a> as a comic book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome to the Jungle (Graphic Novel)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/03/welcome-to-the-jungle-graphic-novel/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/03/welcome-to-the-jungle-graphic-novel/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/jungle-01-they-call-me.png" alt="Jungle-01-They-call-me">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s certainly a bit different&amp;ndash;there&amp;rsquo;s less room to breath and less freedom to imagine the characters as you want, but on the other hand, it&amp;rsquo;s more Dresden Files!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
