&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There are three conditions you must agree to meet before I grant you this opportunity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Firstly, the considerable skill you possess must be used only for good. You will not let bitterness or anger draw you down the darker ways of your craft.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Secondly, if anyone asks for your help, you will give it willingly. I do not mean solely those who come to you for assistance with their ailments, but anyone at all who seeks your aid.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“And thirdly?” It occurred to me that I could be as good a liar as anyone. What was to stop me from agreeing now, and once I was out of here, doing whatever I pleased? I might yet live beyond dawn and see Mathuin brought down before nightfall. My heart began to race.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Thirdly, you will not seek vengeance. You will remain in Dalriada and stay away from Mathuin of Laois.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Take a bit of magic/folklore in an oldentimes Ireland; add in a Fae bargain (with all the complications that ensues); combine with a prince and princess who&amp;rsquo;ve never met outside of letters&amp;ndash;and seem entirely different in person; and finish it all off with fairy tale magic of Dreamer&amp;rsquo;s Pool.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
