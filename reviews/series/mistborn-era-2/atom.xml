&lt;p>Sanderson has this tendency to completely change the world in ways that you&amp;rsquo;d never think could possibly work&amp;hellip; and yet pull them off. He did it between the first and second Mistborn books and he just did it again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worldbuilding-wise, so many things have changed. Yet he hasn&amp;rsquo;t really broken the rules that he set down in the previous books, just expanded them, exploring areas that we&amp;rsquo;ve never seen before. We learn about people that live far from the Lord Ruler&amp;rsquo;s rule. We learn about new and fascinating ways that the Metallic Arts can be used&amp;ndash;Feruchemy in particular. And we start to see just how magic and technology can be combined.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shadows of Self</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/25/shadows-of-self/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/25/shadows-of-self/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>Shadows of Self takes place in the same timeline and with mostly the same characters as Alloy of Law. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard, this is supposed to be the actual first book of the second trilogy, with Alloy of Law being essentially a happy accident.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wax and Wayne are back, in all their awesome glory. I still greatly enjoy what Sanderson did both with their Allomantic/Feruchemic abilities (they&amp;rsquo;re more interesting / real feeling that the full Mistborn of the original trilogy) along with their great personalities. Wayne is the best sort of crazy and Wax is just as driven as ever. Marasi also gets a chance to shine as well, becoming a constable in her own right and putting her sharp mind, passion, and years of schooling to good use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Alloy of Law</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/11/the-alloy-of-law/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/06/11/the-alloy-of-law/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In Alloy of Law, Sanderson demonstrates not one, but two things that he&amp;rsquo;s done which I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen another author pull off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For one, he has a massive shared universe in the Cosmere. Each world has its own unique magic system (Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s strength) with just enough relation to the others to hint that they might just be part of a bigger universe.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
