&lt;p>Of the main plotlines, we get a lot more of Randall Six and Arnie. I like the story in general, but the pacing is strange, stretching across two books and then sort of ending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We get Helios and yet another Erika, along with all sorts of things starting to go wrong with the New Race. It&amp;rsquo;s pushing increasingly into Horror, especially Body Horror, and I like it. The only gotcha is that it feels rather weird for it all to be going wrong &lt;em>now&lt;/em>. I do like seeing more variations and points of view among the New Race. They&amp;rsquo;re not all the same, no matter how much Helios wants them to be and that is fascinating. Especially when you bring Deucalion into the mix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We get more of Carson and Michael, now off the rails and going straight cop turned vigilante. It makes sense, given the complete inability to know who&amp;rsquo;s Old and who&amp;rsquo;s New, but it still is a bit jarring. I do love their banter. At this point, I wholly expect one or both not to survive the series, which is a bummer, but expected in this sort of thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the weirdest thing about this book (and the series thus far) is that it really all feels like one very very long single novel. The &amp;rsquo;endings&amp;rsquo; do tend to end at least one plot thread, but there are always new things being brought up and random threads ending well before the end of a book. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I care for the style. But I&amp;rsquo;m too into the series now to stop!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All that being said, it&amp;rsquo;s a good book and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to where we go next!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prodigal Son</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/07/prodigal-son/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/07/prodigal-son/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Knowledge is knowing that Frankenstein is not the monster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wisdom is knowing that Frankenstein is the monster.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A questionable phrase when applied to the original book. Full of hubris. A coward. Not really a &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo; person, sure. But a monster?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, in Dean Koontz&amp;rsquo;s version&amp;hellip; yeah. Victor Frankenstein (now Victor Helios)&amp;ndash;totally the monster.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
