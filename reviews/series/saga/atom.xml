I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize the 9 volumes out were the first half of the planned story arc. Without getting into spoilers&amp;hellip; holy crap that&amp;rsquo;s a cliffhanger!!! At least I&amp;rsquo;ve already skipped two years of waiting?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a lot of things come to an end. Hazel and Squire are growing up and fighting (as you do):&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Saga, Vol. 8</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/06/02/saga-vol.-8/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/06/02/saga-vol.-8/</guid><description>&lt;p>Man this universe just keeps getting more and more surreal. That&amp;rsquo;s what you get where Sci-Fi is real, Fantasy is real, and you want to really explore just what it means to be &lt;em>people&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You get owl people:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Saga, Vol. 7</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/06/01/saga-vol.-7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/06/01/saga-vol.-7/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh these poor poor people. The main family. The Will. All of them. Man this series got depressing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But for the moment, let&amp;rsquo;s back up a bit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Saga, Vol. 6</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/30/saga-vol.-6/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/30/saga-vol.-6/</guid><description>&lt;p>Man this story just keeps going and going. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly interesting to see how the relationships between characters you never at first thought would interact well grow and change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Saga continues to paint pictures of modern world problems, such as how homosexual relationships are treated:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Saga, Vol. 5</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/29/saga-vol.-5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/29/saga-vol.-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a pretty great addition to the Saga tale. We start out with everyone seperated and see all the tirls and tribulations they have to go through to get back together. It&amp;rsquo;s still the perfect blend of entirely-too-real, absolutely mad and surreal worldbuilding, and underlying themes that really make you think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the Wisdom of GhÃ¼s:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Saga, Vol. 4</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/26/saga-vol.-4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/26/saga-vol.-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>First one not on comiXology unlimited. Worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man this one was crazy. Everything is changed, a pile of major and minor characters that we&amp;rsquo;d been getting to know are dead, the parents are separated (minor spoiler, but it really comes down to the how that&amp;rsquo;s the big part; I didn&amp;rsquo;t see that coming).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Saga, Vol. 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/25/saga-vol.-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/25/saga-vol.-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>They just keep getting better! Against the backdrop of a universe gone mad with all manner of weird beings trying to kill them&amp;hellip; you have people that feel so real, with all the &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; problems that come with it:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dealing with the MIL:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Saga, Vol. 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/24/saga-vol.-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/24/saga-vol.-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>The story continues! We have the core family and the &lt;del>out&lt;/del> inlaws on the run in a wooden rocketship, trying to lose all manner of bounty hunters and the war between their species behind. Oh, this is a story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/saga-2-3-summary.png" alt="Saga-2-3-Summary">&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Saga, Vol. 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/23/saga-vol.-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/23/saga-vol.-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to read these for a while, they have some of the best reviews among graphic novels ever, they have a fantastic premise (a fantasy world IN SPACE), and they&amp;rsquo;re on comiXology Unlimited. What better time than the present?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall: they live up to expectations. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more &amp;lsquo;human&amp;rsquo; to the story than I expected, revolving around the costs of war and the first stages of bringing a new baby into the world. I mean, heck. It starts with childbirth:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
