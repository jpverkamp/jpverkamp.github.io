&lt;p>“A hero does not choose her trials. She steps into the darkness, then she faces what comes next.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you are the sort to want absolutely zero spoilers going into a book &lt;em>stop reading now&lt;/em>. Go read the book (it&amp;rsquo;s really good, that&amp;rsquo;s not a spoiler :spoiler:) and then come back. You have been warned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay, now that that&amp;rsquo;s out of the way. It&amp;rsquo;s been &amp;hellip; three years since I first read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/02/28/skyward/">Skyward&lt;/a>. WheN I read it, the sequels weren&amp;rsquo;t even out yet&amp;hellip; when Starsight first came out, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to it. I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat lamenting that lack now. 😄 But as they say, the second best time to plant a tree is today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, Starsight takes place where Skyward left off. Spensa has some crazy new powers she doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand, M-Bot is out in the open&amp;ndash;and really the star of the book&amp;ndash;, and humanity is ready to take back the stars&amp;hellip; More or less.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Spoilers. For real, albeit minor.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Defending Elysium</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/07/defending-elysium/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/07/defending-elysium/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“You must understand that he knew the risks of living in an undeveloped civilization. Creatures of lesser intelligence cannot be held responsible for their acts of barbarity. You have not yet learned a better way.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve only read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/02/28/skyward/">Skyward&lt;/a> before of that series, so on re-reading, I noticed that Defending Elysium is sort of a prequel? It&amp;rsquo;s unclear to me exactly how much. It feels like the same world, but set well before and with none of the same characters? Especially since I haven&amp;rsquo;t read past Skyward before&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a bit more worldbuilding and background than I&amp;rsquo;d otherwise be aware of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Short, but worth a read in my opinion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Skyward</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/02/28/skyward/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/02/28/skyward/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I imagined those broken rocks as the broken bodies of my enemies, their bones shattered, their trembling arms reaching upward in a useless gesture of total and complete defeat. I was a very odd little girl.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Spensa (Spin) is an odd girl in an odd world. Humanity is trapped on an alien planet for reasons (initially) unknown. The sky is filled with rubble and debris that occasionally rains down on them and from time to time aliens come down and try to kill them. Spin&amp;rsquo;s father is a pilot, trying to protect them, but he dies early in the book (before a timeskip), called a coward&amp;ndash;seemingly one of the worst things you can call someone in this world.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
