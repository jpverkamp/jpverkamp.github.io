Originally (8 years ago), I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thrilled. Enough to DNF the series (although not the book). On a reread (+relisten?), I loved it and am looking forward to more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>8 years ago, I first read Temeraire. I thought the idea was fascinating. An alternate history set around the time of Napoleon, tied fairly closely to our own world. Only: Dragons! Cool, no? And turns out&amp;hellip; it is pretty cool!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yet somehow, I managed to find myself annoyed by the mechanics of dragons, their intelligence, and&amp;ndash;for some reason&amp;ndash;the idea that there was a &amp;lsquo;chosen one&amp;rsquo; trope going on? I feel like I must have mellowed out somewhat in age. Or decided that I like almost everything now. Or read enough &lt;em>really&lt;/em> good Naomi Novik that I wanted to give it another try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that one big difference this time was listening to the audiobook. Some books just work better that way&amp;ndash;something about the book picking you up and carrying you along, where it&amp;rsquo;s easier to just keep listening rather than having to work at it. This is definitely one of them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
