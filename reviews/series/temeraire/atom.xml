&lt;p>â€œThose men want to take Laurence from me, and put him in prison, and execute him, and I will not let them, ever, and I do not care if Laurence tells me not to squash you,&amp;quot; he added, fiercely, to Lord Barham.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Laurence and the British Government may think that Temeraire was won fairly under the articles of war&amp;hellip; but the Chinese aren&amp;rsquo;t so sure. In an effort to appease them, off Temeraire and Laurence go, halfway around the world to see if they can&amp;rsquo;t convince them otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a number of parts to really like about this book: Getting to travel the world is neat. The difference of Chinese culture, especially around dragons is fun. I like the idea of basically a Napoleonic era aircraft carrier for dragons. There are other related big beasties in the world as well!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The discussions about slavery, the differences in culture between the British and Chinese, and what that might mean for dragons were fascinating. Especially having read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/">A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians&lt;/a> not &lt;em>that&lt;/em> long ago, it was interesting to see another take on the same period&amp;ndash;especially when we randomly get news that Pitt has died.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course, the aforequoted relationship between Temeraire and Laurence. That&amp;rsquo;s really a great part of the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a downside, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit less action packed than the first book. We get a couple of big fights, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, but it&amp;rsquo;s got a low slower pace. A bit jarring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>His Majesty's Dragon</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/15/his-majestys-dragon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Apr 2023 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/15/his-majestys-dragon/</guid><description>&lt;p>TLDR: Well that&amp;rsquo;s unexpected. Originally (8 years ago), I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thrilled. Enough to DNF the series (although not the book). On a reread (+relisten?), I loved it and am looking forward to more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>8 years ago, I first read Temeraire. I thought the idea was fascinating. An alternate history set around the time of Napoleon, tied fairly closely to our own world. Only: Dragons! Cool, no? And turns out&amp;hellip; it is pretty cool!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yet somehow, I managed to find myself annoyed by the mechanics of dragons, their intelligence, and&amp;ndash;for some reason&amp;ndash;the idea that there was a &amp;lsquo;chosen one&amp;rsquo; trope going on? I feel like I must have mellowed out somewhat in age. Or decided that I like almost everything now. Or read enough &lt;em>really&lt;/em> good Naomi Novik that I wanted to give it another try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that one big difference this time was listening to the audiobook. Some books just work better that way&amp;ndash;something about the book picking you up and carrying you along, where it&amp;rsquo;s easier to just keep listening rather than having to work at it. This is definitely one of them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
