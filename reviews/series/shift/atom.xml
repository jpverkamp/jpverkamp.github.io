Although I guess given that Shift is a prequel of sorts to Wool, it makes sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The stories this time around are split between Donny (who&amp;rsquo;s taken Thurman&amp;rsquo;s place &amp;hellip; somehow?) and Solo. Donny&amp;rsquo;s storyline does finally answer a few more questions: what is the real purpose of so many Silos and why are the powers that be okay with entirely losing them from time to time. It also serves as closure for Donny&amp;rsquo;s feeling of betrayal and loss of his wife&amp;ndash;in rather a dramatic manner. The lack of fallout is a bit of a problem though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Second Shift: Order</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/08/05/second-shift-order/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/08/05/second-shift-order/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="16148938" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16148938.second-shift-order">Second Shift: Order&lt;/a> definitely has &amp;lsquo;middle book&amp;rsquo; syndrome going for it, but in this case, it certainly works. You get a pile of answers to questions raised both in &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="13603717" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13603717.first-shift-legacy">First Shift: Legacy&lt;/a> and &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="12287209" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12287209.wool">Wool&lt;/a> along with filling out the world of the Silos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating dystopia and feels just real enough to be terrifyingly possible. I do prefer Order over Legacy in that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the &amp;lsquo;modern day&amp;rsquo; / pre-Silo points of view. I find it more interesting to get hints of that world from after the fall, rather than having everything spelled out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Shift: Legacy</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/08/01/first-shift-legacy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/08/01/first-shift-legacy/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I read &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="12287209" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12287209.wool">Wool&lt;/a>. Long enough that I&amp;rsquo;d started to forget the general shape of things, but as I went through &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="13603717" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13603717.first-shift-legacy">First Shift: Legacy&lt;/a>, things started to come back. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting seeing the gaps in Wool&amp;rsquo;s history.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, the prequel chapters (of a prequel) just feel wrong. The Silos were built in a matter of years by the government? With apparently minimal or no leaks? Run by a Senator which apparently gets two Representatives to do his absolute bidding (What about their own jobs? It would have made more sense had Donald remained an architect).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
