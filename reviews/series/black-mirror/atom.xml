&lt;p>I actually watched &lt;em>Joan is Awful&lt;/em> on accident a while back and that&amp;rsquo;s really the highlight of the season. The problems with generative AI written perhaps a little too large, but that&amp;rsquo;s what Black Mirror &lt;em>does&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than that, this is really getting more into horror anthology territory, which I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to think about. I&amp;rsquo;ll still catch Season 7 if/when it&amp;rsquo;s out, but it&amp;rsquo;s a bit less sure than I used to be.&lt;/p>

Whee!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting how the three episodes are at once similar and so different. There&amp;rsquo;s little enough radically different technology&amp;ndash;mostly extrapolations of what we have now or may expect to have soon&amp;ndash;but it&amp;rsquo;s done well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And even with just three, we already have one that&amp;rsquo;s a straight forward exploration, one that&amp;rsquo;s more of a slow burn, and one that has a sudden sharp escalation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot to fit into a short season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Black Mirror: Season 4</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/05/06/black-mirror-season-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/05/06/black-mirror-season-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Onward to Season 4!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have a lot of interesting technology this time around. Virtual reality. Filtering reality (again). Messing with memories (they really like this one&amp;hellip;). Dating. Being hunted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m still quite enjoying this series. Check it out!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Black Mirror: Season 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/29/black-mirror-season-3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/29/black-mirror-season-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another solid season. I&amp;rsquo;m so hit and miss at watching these.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Social media. Virtual reality writ real (they do that a lot this season). Extortion. Life after death (of a sorts). Bugs. Politics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has it all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to me how Black Mirror at once manages to explore such a wide variety of potential future technology&amp;ndash;and at the same time have the same little VR dots on the head in episode after episode. ðŸ˜„&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Black Mirror: Season 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/18/black-mirror-season-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/18/black-mirror-season-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Onward we go!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only barely long than season 2, it still manages to pack quite a bunch. We have the &lt;a href="#1-be-right-back">prescient one (given all the news about LLMs/AIs)&lt;/a>, the &lt;a href="#2-white-bear">one where the world&amp;rsquo;s ended&lt;/a> (or may be a world has ended), the &lt;a href="#3-the-waldo-moment">politics are stupid&amp;ndash;ha ha&amp;ndash;one&lt;/a>, and the &lt;a href="#4-white-christmas">twisted and all connected one&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is quite the show. How did I miss this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to season 2!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Black Mirror: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/17/black-mirror-season-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/17/black-mirror-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Been meaning to watch this for years. Finally got around to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting; especially for only have three episodes in the first season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="#1-the-national-anthem">The first episode&lt;/a> is kind of weird and by far the least &amp;lsquo;sci-fi&amp;rsquo; of the bunch&amp;ndash;this could happen now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="#2-fifteen-million-merits">The second&lt;/a> though starts out as fairly straight forward near future dystopia and then goes &lt;em>dark&lt;/em> from there. I like it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And &lt;a href="#3-the-entire-history-of-you">the third&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;take a concept (recording everything), apply the concept to imperfect (honestly fairly terrible) people and see what breaks. It&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to season 2!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
