Heaven, Hell, and… a Third Place. Mythology certainly goes some interesting places in Hellblazer. I enjoyed it.
Empathy is the Enemy Confident. Can’t say it isn’t deserved though.
Not something monks want to hear I expect.
IRL the team seems attached to a particular brand of Fundamentalist Christians. I like this idea better.
The Season of the Zealot Map!
The Red Right Hand How do you fix something like that?</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 18: The Gift</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/15/hellblazer-vol.-18-the-gift/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/15/hellblazer-vol.-18-the-gift/</guid><description>All about that little issue of Constantine and one very very long day.
There’s a lot of crazy things going on better my here. Quiet a story… where can it possibly go next?
Reasons to be Cheerful Twisted. Of course this would come back sooner rather than later.
Wonder who they got that from…
Cross Purpose New art, the fallout for Chas, and family troubles. Oh this story.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 17: Out of Season</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/14/hellblazer-vol.-17-out-of-season/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/14/hellblazer-vol.-17-out-of-season/</guid><description>Constantine lost and found and so very screwed. Literally. A lot happens in this one and there’s a lot of potential for what comes next. Looking forward to it.
Staring at the Wall The continuing story of the Shadow Dog and the Red Sepulchre.
Good times.
Cool detail.
And an excellent sense of scale.
It got worse! Uberpowerful beings bound by their own rules, always a good one.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 16: The Wild Card</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/05/hellblazer-vol.-16-the-wild-card/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/05/hellblazer-vol.-16-the-wild-card/</guid><description>A crazy bloody mess with some old friends in the longer stories and a few neat bits in the short ones. But more of Angela and Gemma.
A rather solid volume.
Thoughts as I read (spoilers):
High on Life Constantine with brown hair?! (Might be red) What’s this?
Bit of an ass.
Using his blood to heal/as a pick me up is quite the trick.
That’s a neat trick…</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 15: Highwater</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/13/hellblazer-vol.-15-highwater/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/13/hellblazer-vol.-15-highwater/</guid><description>It’s… fine? I enjoyed the first two longer stories well enough but the latter one was all kinds of weird. And not in a way I cared for?
Onward! Maybe to something new?
Individual thoughts (spoilers):
Lapdogs and Englishmen That’s what I was looking for. Great art style, interesting story. Bit of magic (ish), bits of fate.
Oh Constantine. It fits though. 5
And then suddenly young punk Constantine.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 14: Good Intentions</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/11/hellblazer-vol.-14-good-intentions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/11/hellblazer-vol.-14-good-intentions/</guid><description>That’s a few hard hitting stories. Hard Times is about Constantine in prison. Weird art style and hard to read. Good Intentions is the aftermath… people are terrible. Freezes Over it’s a pretty good locked room mystery with just the possibility of something more.
Overall, good but not the best Constantine. Needs more out and out unambiguous supernatural IMO.
Onwards!
Thoughts/spoilers:
Hard Time (Parts 1-5) Been a while. Came back to…</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 13: Haunted</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/11/hellblazer-vol.-13-haunted/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/11/hellblazer-vol.-13-haunted/</guid><description>One heck of a crazy longer story (Haunted, one of the best of that length) and a bunch of shorter ones, ranging from not much to really good.
Mini-reviews and pretty pictures (spoilers):
Haunted That’s a story. Enough time to breathe, a cast of new and interesting story, and all sorts of gross and creepy scenes.
Part One Oy. Although you can’t say she’s wrong.
Murder scene description: oy that’s graphic.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 12: How to Play with Fire</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/07/hellblazer-vol.-12-how-to-play-with-fire/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/07/hellblazer-vol.-12-how-to-play-with-fire/</guid><description>Three multiple parters? No single issues? Sweet. Up the Down Staircase want my favorite, but both How to Play with Fire and Son of Man were excellent.
Mini reviews, pretty (horrifying) pictures and spoilers:
Up the Down Staircase Memes? I feel like I missed something. Interesting character development, but no real pay off.
Part One You are dating the wrong man.
Other than that, we have a fairly standard meet the family type scene.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 11: Last Man Standing</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/03/hellblazer-vol.-11-last-man-standing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/03/hellblazer-vol.-11-last-man-standing/</guid><description>A solid one. Big stories are interesting, little ones are touching_weird_sweet, and Constantine’s got some new people and problems to deal with. Nothing too surreal either, which I appreciate.
Mini-reviews (spoilers):
Days of Wine and Roses A little bit of Constantine, a little bit of regular human terror.
The Wild Hunt Oh my.
Also: Colts!
Last Man Standing Argue and his men as ancient immortals? Merlin as a dragon?</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 10: In the Line of Fire</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/01/hellblazer-vol.-10-in-the-line-of-fire/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/01/hellblazer-vol.-10-in-the-line-of-fire/</guid><description>Fortune telling, Constantine’s father, more evil demons and arguably worse angels, and of course dead soldiers who can’t find rest.
Not a standout volume, but still pretty good.
Mini reviews (spoilers):
The Nature of the Beast Sure…
Reading the future is a common enough trope in this genre, but I enjoyed it.
Walking the Dog Another ghost story&amp;hellip;
…ish.
Oops. A neat twist.
Punkin’ Up the Great Outdoors Going to be a weird one:</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 9: Critical Mass</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/hellblazer-vol.-9-critical-mass/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/hellblazer-vol.-9-critical-mass/</guid><description>Two big stories, a few really trippy dreams, and Constantine managing to push off damnation a bit longer. A neat collection. Critical Mass in particular is worth the read.
Mini reviews (spoilers):
In Another Part of Hell Chas’ mother… quite a figure.
Warped Notions Part One: The Delicate Power of Terror Allllll right then.
Same thing.
Part Two: The Everything Virus They’re really going into the weird this time around…</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 8: Rake at the Gates of Hell</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/09/hellblazer-vol.-8-rake-at-the-gates-of-hell/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/09/hellblazer-vol.-8-rake-at-the-gates-of-hell/</guid><description>There was a lot of potential in this episode, with two longer storylines&amp;ndash;one the continuation of the angels/devil storyline we&amp;rsquo;ve been dealing with for a while. But unfortunately, outside of a few very cool/trippy visuals it was a surprisingly quiet volume. A lot of human trouble, not enough supernatural craziness. Less moping at least, but without a real transition (at least in my opinion). Not terrible, but certainly one of the weaker entries in the series.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 7: Tainted Love</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/07/hellblazer-vol.-7-tainted-love/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/07/hellblazer-vol.-7-tainted-love/</guid><description>Another solid volume. In particular, there&amp;rsquo;s another volume about angels/demons/and the troubles they get into. It&amp;rsquo;s not quite as good as the one in Bloodlines, but still enjoyable. An interesting take on Gabriel, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure.
End of the Line Family trouble…
… of the magical kind.
Both ways:
Forty … years old and all alone. Until:
Now that’s a party. Oh my. They even got Swamp Thing.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Volume 6: Bloodlines</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/03/hellblazer-volume-6-bloodlines/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 00:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/03/hellblazer-volume-6-bloodlines/</guid><description>A very solid issue. A couple of great longer storylines with long term consequences (Guys &amp;amp; Dolls was great) and a few shorter one offs (Lord of the Dance in particular I enjoyed). Could have been longer, but there’s still potentially more story to be told there.
I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying seeing Constantine and Kit&amp;rsquo;s relationship evolve. It gives a nice human element to contrast the horror. I only hope that doesn&amp;rsquo;t go too badly for her in the long run&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 5: Dangerous Habits</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/23/hellblazer-vol.-5-dangerous-habits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/23/hellblazer-vol.-5-dangerous-habits/</guid><description>Weird, slow, and dark at first but then we get the Deadly Habits storyline. That’s one of the core Constantine storylines so far as I know and for good reason.
The Bogeyman Oh Constantine. What is going on with you. Dark and depressing and little happening. Sets up a story I suppose.
Dead-Boy’s Heart That’s a great issue. Took me a bit to realize it was typing Constantine. So he’s always been … a little different.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 4: The Family Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/07/hellblazer-vol.-4-the-family-man/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/07/hellblazer-vol.-4-the-family-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>Better than Volume 3 by a long shot. Starts weird but interesting and gets better from there. I’ll reiterate though that I can’t really imagine buying these by issue, especially in real time. A volume has enough meat to it to sustain a storyline.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 3: The Fear Machine</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/01/hellblazer-vol.-3-the-fear-machine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/01/hellblazer-vol.-3-the-fear-machine/</guid><description>Not terrible, but also not great. It starts very slowly with a hippie commune and takes a few issues to get going and gets downright weird at a few points. But enjoyable enough after that.
Onward!
Issue specific reviews, spoilers:
Touching the Earth Oh boy.
And then it goes all weird hippy commune. Sure? I don’t really get it. Imagine paying for this as a single issue…
Shepherd’s Warning Well, it’s more of the same story, but there’s potential at least!</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 2: The Devil You Know</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/23/hellblazer-vol.-2-the-devil-you-know/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/23/hellblazer-vol.-2-the-devil-you-know/</guid><description>Well that’s a ride. The continuation of the Swamp Thing sexy times storyline, some more backstory on how Constantine got to be how he is, Constantine all Arthurian (for some reason), and a straight up horror story.
Weaker than volume 1 but worth continuing to volume 3!
Sex and Death Starts where we left off, with Constantine out of body and the Swamp Thing doing his mating thing… That is not a plot line I care at all about.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 1: Original Sins</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/14/hellblazer-vol.-1-original-sins/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/14/hellblazer-vol.-1-original-sins/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I really do have a thing for urban fantasy specifically dealing with demons and angels, good and evil, especially if it twists it all around. Constantine does that in spades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I watched the 2005 film well before I knew it was based on a comic (so sue me), so Keanu Reeves is forever going to be stuck in my head as the true Constantine, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also watched just about all of the new wave of DC shows, including the 2014 version of Constantine plus his appearances on Legends of Tomorrow. Not quite the same, but I still loved the character.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
