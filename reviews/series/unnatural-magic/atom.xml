&lt;p>Basically, take a struggling thief/con artist (with a tendency towards fire magic), give her a job bodyguarding a soon to be married young Lady and&amp;hellip; see what happens. There are some crazy fight scenes, a few light plot twists, a skeletal mouse that goes BONG&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and &amp;hellip; perhaps a chance to fall in love&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, man this is quite a cast. We have the Delly&amp;ndash;our protagonist thief that can light things on fire&amp;ndash;but the supporting cast are even better. Winn. A part troll illusionist/brawler&amp;ndash;with quite the accent and past. Mrs. Totham, the &lt;strike>Necromancer&lt;/strike> Body Scientist. The academic. The lady. The mother.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course Buttons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that one for you to discover, but each time I the narrator read &amp;lsquo;Buttons said, “Bong.”&amp;rsquo; I found myself grinning. It&amp;rsquo;s just weird and delightful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Settingwise, it&amp;rsquo;s quasi-Victorian, which is a lot of fun. The language is a bit weird at times, with quite a few unexpected &amp;lsquo;fucks&amp;rsquo; jumping out at you.. but apparently that&amp;rsquo;s about when the term really started to take off and branch out, so&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;her perception of egregious enfucktation in her current, present, and unfortunate familial circumstances&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun setting though, going from the cities you most often see in a Victorian style out into the country and back. I want to see more of this world!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect the &amp;lsquo;protection&amp;rsquo; mission itself to take up such relatively little of the book. It&amp;rsquo;s more an inciting incident than anything, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad for it. When we moved on from that&amp;ndash;I was not at all ready to move on from this book. It&amp;rsquo;s all fairly straight forward (I expected a late book twist that never really materialized).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, that was yet another delight of a book and if anything in this review struck your fancy&amp;ndash;well worth the read!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: This is apparently a sequel of sorts? Oops. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, it&amp;rsquo;s more set in the same world with minor crossovers. But I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to go back and read it now!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
