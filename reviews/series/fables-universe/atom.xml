It&amp;rsquo;s been an awfully long strange trip, that probably overstayed it&amp;rsquo;s welcome just a bit. But on the whole it&amp;rsquo;s been quite the story and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have read it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of neat having a page or two with the &amp;lsquo;last story&amp;rsquo; of many different fables. We get to see some like Boy Blue again, which I appreciate. Even if/especially if he (more or less) stayed dead.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fairest, Volume 5: The Clamour for Glamour</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/22/fairest-volume-5-the-clamour-for-glamour/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/22/fairest-volume-5-the-clamour-for-glamour/</guid><description>&lt;p>Of all the the ways for Fairest to end, Reynard knocking up a random mundie girl, a murder mystery among the non-human fables, and the final tale of Goldielocks was not where I expected it to go.&lt;/p>

Jack of Fables should probably have ended back with &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="6378575" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6378575.jack-of-fables-vol-6-the-big-book-of-war"> Jack of Fables, Vol. 6: The Big Book of War &lt;/a> . It wrapped up everything nicely enough. Instead it just keeps going. But here, we have a finale! Except&amp;hellip; &lt;span class="spoiler">everyone dies&lt;/span>
Not even kidding. After we&amp;rsquo;ve come to know and love all these characters, the big finale is them all getting together for one last battle &amp;hellip; and every one of them &lt;span class="spoiler">dies&lt;/span>
. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s one way to end a series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sucks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fables, Vol. 20: Camelot</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/16/fables-vol.-20-camelot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/16/fables-vol.-20-camelot/</guid><description>&lt;p>Onward and Fableward, we&amp;rsquo;re almost to the end!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this volume, we have the story of a little girl wondering about Castle Dark / the new Fabletown (cute), Rose Red growing in her position as a Paladin of Hope and refounding the Round Table (it&amp;rsquo;s weird and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the point is), and Snow White growing darker as she loses her children/at least their childhoods and husband.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fairest: In All the Land</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/06/fairest-in-all-the-land/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/06/fairest-in-all-the-land/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fairest. The story of Cinderella, this time trying to solve a murder mystery as all the &amp;lsquo;fairest in the land&amp;rsquo; (there are amusingly many of them) are dropping like flies. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a fairly decent murder mystery and while you completely expect that there will be some way (MAGIC!) to bring them back in the end, there&amp;rsquo;s still a chance that they might not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s decent, although there are better Fables stories. Better Fairest stories even.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fables, Vol. 19: Snow White</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/05/fables-vol.-19-snow-white/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/05/fables-vol.-19-snow-white/</guid><description>&lt;p>And thus, 19 stories in we have the &amp;lsquo;story of Snow White&amp;rsquo;. Which details a first husband we&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of who&amp;rsquo;s a comically bad guy and wants to ruins everyone&amp;rsquo;s day&amp;hellip; and actually does manager to &lt;span class="spoiler">kill Bigby...&lt;/span>
. Really?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, we have piles of backstory with BUFKIN THE LIBERATOR&amp;hellip; who is not really that interesting. And apparently will never actually interact with the main Fables storyline? Meh.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fables, Vol. 18: Cubs in Toyland</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/10/21/fables-vol.-18-cubs-in-toyland/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/10/21/fables-vol.-18-cubs-in-toyland/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well this was a bizarre little story.&lt;/p>

survived. And now he&amp;rsquo;s a Maharaja in a world of Indian Fables. I guess I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t really be surprised.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Storywise, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty crazy. It&amp;rsquo;s awesome to see the character growth. He&amp;rsquo;s an ass, but he&amp;rsquo;s got a lot of potential. A near death, saving the world&amp;hellip; might just do the thing?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fairest, Volume 2: The Hidden Kingdom</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/10/16/fairest-volume-2-the-hidden-kingdom/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/10/16/fairest-volume-2-the-hidden-kingdom/</guid><description>&lt;p>Back to Fairest (slightly out of order). This time we have Rapunzel in Japan, somehow or another, and another appearance of Jack&amp;ndash;isn&amp;rsquo;t he a Dragon now? Did I miss something?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the influence of Japanese Fables to the mix, this is by far one of the weirder books:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fables, Vol. 17: Inherit the Wind</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/10/15/fables-vol.-17-inherit-the-wind/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/10/15/fables-vol.-17-inherit-the-wind/</guid><description>&lt;p>And now we have the fallout from &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="10974311" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10974311.fables-vol-16-super-team">Fables, Vol. 16: Super Team&lt;/a>. North Wind sacrificed himself to defeat Mr. Dark, but in the way of these stories, there must always be a North Wind. And since there are a whole pile of direct descendents (in Bigby and Snow&amp;rsquo;s children), well, perhaps one of them will become king.&lt;/p>

Mr. Dark is on the move and the Fables have decided that in order to fight him&amp;hellip; they have to become Superheroes? You know, honestly, given that they&amp;rsquo;ve been proven to be more powerful based on how many people know their stories, it kind of works.&lt;/p>

So instead, we&amp;rsquo;re going to deal with the fall of Rose Red after the death of Boy Blue and a shock from her past strong enough to shake her out of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s worth reading just for that, a bit of exploration into depression and loss from the framework of the Fables universe. And man has Red been through a lot&amp;ndash;even before Boy Blue died.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fables, Vol. 14: Witches</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/09/14/fables-vol.-14-witches/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/09/14/fables-vol.-14-witches/</guid><description>&lt;p>Back to Fables and back to the problem of Mr. Dark! Originally I had no idea where Fables could go after the Adversary was defeated, but this works. A power vaccuum, filled by all sorts of big bads. It turns out that as dark as Geppetto went, he still arguably did some good (as all evil empires seem to do on some level). Fun times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A solid story. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting getting more insight into some of the more magical folks in Fabletown. They&amp;rsquo;re a lot less straight forward than the Fables, which I approve of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jack of Fables, Vol. 8: The Fulminate Blade</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/09/13/jack-of-fables-vol.-8-the-fulminate-blade/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/09/13/jack-of-fables-vol.-8-the-fulminate-blade/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sooo&amp;hellip; meet the new Jack, better* than the old Jack?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jack&amp;rsquo;s son (by way of the Winter Queen, many books ago) is now the Jack of the Fables and old Jack has managed to convince him that the way to great power and fulfullmet is through quests and adventures. Which&amp;hellip; sure.

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/jack-7-02.jpg" alt="Jack-7-02">&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fables, Vol. 13: The Great Fables Crossover</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/09/07/fables-vol.-13-the-great-fables-crossover/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/09/07/fables-vol.-13-the-great-fables-crossover/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oooh boy. This is a weird one. Jack and the Literals spill into the Farm, just as the Fabletown residents have been forced out by Dark problems of their own. So who comes first, the Literals or the Dark One? Well, perhaps the one that, with a stroke of the pen, can change the very nature of reality&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a crazy story, but a bit weaker than many of the Fables stories so far. I like either plot well enough, but combining the two feels weirder than I&amp;rsquo;d hoped. It is interesting to see how the cult of Boy Blue continues to take form. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where that will end up going in the long run, but I expect&amp;hellip; not well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fables, Vol. 12: The Dark Ages</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/08/15/fables-vol.-12-the-dark-ages/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/08/15/fables-vol.-12-the-dark-ages/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it ends&amp;hellip; or perhaps it only begins?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we&amp;rsquo;re really getting into the fallout of what happens when you cut the head off an evil empire&amp;hellip; and then invite him to come live with you. I get why they did it, but I have a feeling that&amp;rsquo;s going to come back to bite them at some point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jack of Fables, Vol. 6: The Big Book of War</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/08/11/jack-of-fables-vol.-6-the-big-book-of-war/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/08/11/jack-of-fables-vol.-6-the-big-book-of-war/</guid><description>&lt;p>More Jack! And this it&amp;rsquo;s the big battle schene in this universe, much like in &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="3392123" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3392123.fables-vol-11-war-and-pieces"> Fables, Vol. 11: War and Pieces &lt;/a> . Gary (the Pathetic Fallacy) really shines here:&lt;/p>

Because of course he is. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting look at the life of a fable further back in time, Jack in particular. And it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see the contrast between Bigby and Jack. Jack may be a fool, but at least he&amp;rsquo;s a passionate one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we get some more scenes back in the future where it looks like war is coming to the Jack of the Fables universe as well as the Fables series. Of course they&amp;rsquo;re both more or less at once. I still do wonder if/when the Literals are going to start crossing over to the main series. Perhaps in &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="6503780" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6503780.fables-vol-13-the-great-fables-crossover">Fables, Vol. 13: The Great Fables Crossover&lt;/a>?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cinderella, Vol. 1: From Fabletown with Love</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/08/04/cinderella-vol.-1-from-fabletown-with-love/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/08/04/cinderella-vol.-1-from-fabletown-with-love/</guid><description>&lt;p>The first in a new subseries: the tales of Cinderella, Secret Agent!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She&amp;rsquo;s another of my favorite characters (I say that a lot, but it&amp;rsquo;s true a lot).

I did not expect at all that the war with the Adversary would escalate so quickly or end before the run of the series, but here we are. We have war heros, super spies, crazy battle scenes, and sacrifices from the last characters we&amp;rsquo;d expect.&lt;/p>

More or less in publishing order, but not directly related. Mostly it&amp;rsquo;s a way to get another few on the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And oh what a weird view it is. Jack is a powerful individual and he knows it, but he&amp;rsquo;s also aboslutely terrible at making any good on that, always jumping from one hairbrained scheme to another. In , he was captured by a power that I&amp;rsquo;m still curious to see more about, now he&amp;rsquo;s on the run. But half of the story is about that time that he was also Jack Frost (and a royal ass about it then too).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fables, Vol. 10: The Good Prince</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/07/18/fables-vol.-10-the-good-prince/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/07/18/fables-vol.-10-the-good-prince/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="2147714" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2147714.fables-vol-10-the-good-prince"> Fables, Vol. 10: The Good Prince &lt;/a> .

&lt;p>In a nut shell: &lt;span class="spoiler">he finds the ghost of Lancelot (yes, that Lancelot), Excaliber (yes, that Excaliber), saves a bunch of damned Fable souls, and makes a kingdom where anyone who wants to sit out the coming war can be safe&lt;/span>

The calm before the storm. It&amp;rsquo;s a number of somewhat lighter tales (relatively speaking!) showing how both sides are preparing to strike back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We get a bit more detail on Frau Totenkinder&amp;ndash;who turns out to be even more than we thought&amp;ndash;and Ambrose/Flycatcher, who seems to have quite the backstory. And of course, the Wolf clan. They&amp;rsquo;re always a lot of fun.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fables: 1001 Nights of Snowfall</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/07/11/fables-1001-nights-of-snowfall/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/07/11/fables-1001-nights-of-snowfall/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="21322" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21322.fables-1001-nights-of-snowfall"> Fables: 1001 Nights of Snowfall &lt;/a> . &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Thousand_and_One_Nights"> One Thousand and One Nights &lt;/a> &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, if the storyteller were Snow White, captured on her way to the Arabian Fables to make a pact against the Adversary.&lt;/p>

And that&amp;rsquo;s just the first story. On top of that, we get another section in the lands of the Fables, with Boy Blue, Action Hero, keen on saving his lady love, willing to Vorpal Sword his way through anyone to get what he wants. And confirmation that the adversary is who we thought he was, plus the big How He Did It all along. Quite the crazy story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m honestly quite impressed with how awesome Boy Blue has turned out to be in this story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fables, Vol. 5: The Mean Seasons</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/06/26/fables-vol.-5-the-mean-seasons/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2020 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/06/26/fables-vol.-5-the-mean-seasons/</guid><description>&lt;p>After the intensity and depth of &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="21325" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21325.fables-vol-4-march-of-the-wooden-soldiers">Fables, Vol. 4: March of the Wooden Soldiers&lt;/a>, I fully expected &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="21330" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21330.fables-vol-5-the-mean-seasons">Fables, Vol. 5: The Mean Seasons&lt;/a> to be something of a step back, a breather. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we got.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s not to say nothing happened. There&amp;rsquo;s a backstory of Bigby wolf in the war, Snow White goes through childbirth, the election between King Cole and Prince Charming finally happens, and Bigby&amp;rsquo;s father finally gets to meet the lady who&amp;rsquo;s snared his son&amp;rsquo;s heart.

I never would have expected extortion and a heist story!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first chapter is a short that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really bear on the rest, with one of teh age old tales of tricking the Devil, capturing Death&amp;ndash;and the problems inheriant in that. It&amp;rsquo;s a great stand alone, but a bit jarring that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit with the rest. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s part of the collected format.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fables, Vol. 2: Animal Farm</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/06/19/fables-vol.-2-animal-farm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/06/19/fables-vol.-2-animal-farm/</guid><description>&lt;p>Where &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="21326" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21326.fables-vol-1-legends-in-exile">Fables, Vol. 1: Legends in Exile&lt;/a> was a murder mystery, &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="167010" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/167010.fables-vol-2-animal-farm">Fables, Vol. 2: Animal Farm&lt;/a> is all about racism, classism, and revolution!

&lt;p>In a nutshell (heh), some Fables&amp;ndash;like nearly all of those we met in Volume 1 can pass as human. But some&amp;hellip; cannot. And those all live at a farm in upstate New York.
