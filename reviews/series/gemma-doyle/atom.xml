&lt;p&gt;Shall I tell you a story? A new and terrible one? A ghost story? Are you &amp;gt; ready? Shall I begin? Once upon a time there were four girls. One was &amp;gt; pretty. One was clever. One charming, and one&amp;hellip;one was mysterious. But they &amp;gt; were all damaged, you see. Something not right about the lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was not at all what I expected. Granted, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect much. I&amp;rsquo;ve had this book on my to read list for years and decided to finally try it without looking at anything but the cover. Instead, we got a slow building paranormal boarding school / historic urban fantasy set in around the turn of the 20th century with a portal fantasy turned surprisingly dark.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
