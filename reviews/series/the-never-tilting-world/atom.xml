Start with elemental magic, nothing &lt;em>super&lt;/em> new there (although acid is always a fun one). Add in an ancient prophecy and twins where only one can rule. Still not that unusual.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then defy the prophecy and &lt;em>literally stop the world spinning&lt;/em>, leaving one side a desert scorched by a never ending noon, the other frozen in perpetual night.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We’re chasing a dying sea under an endless sun that kills us with a thousand little cuts every day. There’ll be nothing left soon. Nothing but sand and bone.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now that&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool worldbuilding, especially for a fantasy world (it&amp;rsquo;s something you see slightly more in sci-fi).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now on top of that, you have a ruler in each world, each with a daughter. Well, you can guess what probably happened and who these two are (remember those twins I mentioned?), but none of them know that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So you get a fascinating ride as each realized just how screwed up their own corner of the world is, falls in love (there is more than a touch of romance in this book)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If the choice is between me risking my life and losing you, I’d choose the first.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;and sets off on a journey to set things right.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When the dead find words, the goddess and the Devoted son will meet atop a fish not a fish, on a sea not a sea. It is she who travels to the endless Abyss, and it is he who guides her.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I quite enjoyed this book. It takes a bit of getting into and the leads are&amp;hellip; more than a touch Young Adult/&amp;lsquo;chosen one&amp;rsquo;ish, but it&amp;rsquo;s still a fun read/listen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
