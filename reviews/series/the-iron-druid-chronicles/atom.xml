&lt;p>On the downside, Staked has pretty much the same issues I&amp;rsquo;ve had with each of the previous novels. I don&amp;rsquo;t really care for the shifting points of view, either the style or the additional viewpoint characters themselves. I think the talking dogs are vastly overdone. The worldbuilding (although neat in a lot of places) is badly kitchen sinky, with literally everything thrown into the same world. And Atticus is just too strong. He&amp;rsquo;s always been too strong from the first book and never felt like he had/has to work at anything.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
