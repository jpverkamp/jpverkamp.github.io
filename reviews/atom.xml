&lt;p>Remember that reality altering meant we found last volume? Well now he’s back… and altering reality!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s one of those stories where you can never be quite sure what’s actually real. Although it was more tame than it could have been&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Decent, but could have been more. Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 16: Deadpool</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/27/ultimate-spider-man-volume-16-deadpool/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/27/ultimate-spider-man-volume-16-deadpool/</guid><description>&lt;p>Spider-Man and Kitty Pride are cute. So when Deadpool randomly shows up to kidnap the X-Men and take them back to Krakoa for that reality show hunt… Spider-Man ends up going along for the ride.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A whole lot of action here, if little in the way of any overarching plot. Fun enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not a fan of this less ambiguous, straight up evil Deadpool. We’ll see if he comes back at some point though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Ultimates 2, Volume 2: Grand Theft America</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/26/the-ultimates-2-volume-2-grand-theft-america/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/26/the-ultimates-2-volume-2-grand-theft-america/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oy. An awful lot happens in this one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have a traitor in the Ultimates. Relationship issues abound (both Cap/Wasp and Iron Man/Black Widow). Death. Destruction. Mayhem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, otherworldly invsions!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s way too much for a single volume, but man does it hit hard. The only real question(s) I have are&amp;hellip; where in the world do you go after something like this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well worth a read, especially after the build up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Wolverine Vs. Hulk</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/26/ultimate-wolverine-vs.-hulk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/26/ultimate-wolverine-vs.-hulk/</guid><description>&lt;p>Opening:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-wolverine-vs-hulk-textbundle-c180a7.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hulk got nuked. Of course it didn’t work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now it’s time to send something even more dangerous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a classic unstoppable force vs immovable object fight and pretty neat. And even then, a couple small twists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 14: Phoenix?</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/25/ultimate-x-men-vol.-14-phoenix/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/25/ultimate-x-men-vol.-14-phoenix/</guid><description>&lt;p>Split volume:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part one, everyone is going on dates and super horny. Comics yo. There’s some serious damage under the surface there though. Nightcrawler. Wolverine. Rogue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part two, some cult is looking for the Phoenix and may just have found it in Jean. Now what?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interesting enough. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/24/good-omens-the-nice-and-accurate-prophecies-of-agnes-nutter-witch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/24/good-omens-the-nice-and-accurate-prophecies-of-agnes-nutter-witch/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Well,” said Crowley, who’d been thinking about this until his head ached, “haven’t you ever wondered about it all? You know—your people and my people, Heaven and Hell, good and evil, all that sort of thing? I mean, why?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“As I recall,” said the angel, stiffly, “there was the rebellion and—”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Ah, yes. And why did it happen, eh? I mean, it didn’t have to, did it?” said Crowley, a manic look in his eye.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Anyone who could build a universe in six days isn’t going to let a little thing like that happen. Unless they want it to, of course.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Oh, come on. Be sensible,” said Aziraphale, doubtfully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“That’s not good advice,” said Crowley. “That’s not good advice at all. If you sit down and think about it sensibly, you come up with some very funny ideas. Like: why make people inquisitive, and then put some forbidden fruit where they can see it with a big neon finger flashing on and off saying THIS IS IT!?”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The ANTICHRIST is born. ARMAGEDDON is coming! And all that stands in the way (for better /and/ for worse) is an angel/demon best friend combo who happen to /like/ living here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh it&amp;rsquo;s so good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve read quite a bit of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/terry-pratchett/">Terry Pratchett&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/neil-gaiman/">Neil Gaiman&lt;/a>, so reading a co-lab between them. Plus, I actually watched the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Omens-Season-1/dp/B089XW1Z6Y">show on Amazon&lt;/a> a while back, well before reading this book. From that order at least, it&amp;rsquo;s one of the particularly faithful and well done adaptations. Both being rather enjoyable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really can&amp;rsquo;t get Michael Sheet and David Tennant out of my head though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which is not a bad thing. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun ride, political/religious in exactly that fun somewhat blasphemous irreverent sort of way. I enjoy watching the ever increasing highjinks, as more plots get involved. The hundreds of years descendent of the one truly accurate prophetess. The Witch Finder Army&amp;ndash;somewhat reduced in manpower. The Four Horsemen&amp;ndash;and the dedicated deliveryman who sets them on their way. Plus the Other Four. And of course, the Antichrist himself. All these powers&amp;ndash;and no one ever taught him how to use them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun ride. You could do far worse than giving it a go!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 15: Silver Sable</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/23/ultimate-spider-man-volume-15-silver-sable/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2023 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/23/ultimate-spider-man-volume-15-silver-sable/</guid><description>&lt;p>In doing some good, Spider-Man has attracted some new friends. Silver Sable! Some bald man in a bird costume! (Vulture). Disgruntled ex-SHIELD folks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Peter’s life just keeps getting better, worse, and more complicated all at once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate X-Men/Fantastic Four</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/23/ultimate-x-men/fantastic-four/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2023 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/23/ultimate-x-men/fantastic-four/</guid><description>&lt;p>That’s a weird one. A couple of X-Men get tricked into fighting the Fantastic Four… for a few panels and then they work together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doesn’t really mesh with anything. And the art is a bit odd.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 13: Magnetic North</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/22/ultimate-x-men-vol.-13-magnetic-north/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/22/ultimate-x-men-vol.-13-magnetic-north/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another magnetic mutant at Frost’s school loses control of her powers (or did she?)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doesn’t matter! Lock her up with Magneto!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing can possibly go wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A solid volume, with some mutants facing off, X-Men vs the Ultimates, and all sorts of trouble setting up for another day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Ultimates 2, Volume 1: Gods and Monsters</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/21/the-ultimates-2-volume-1-gods-and-monsters/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/21/the-ultimates-2-volume-1-gods-and-monsters/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh that’s good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, it comes out that Hulk is still around. After murdering hundreds. And now Thor is off the team (by choice) and it’s less clear than ever if he’s Thor—or a meta human with some serious psychiatric issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love seeing the relationships in the series. Cap and Janet are great—I’m enjoying the slightly more unhinged / human Cap. Pym and Banner as science Bros with issues. Iron Man and Black Widow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of it great.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More of this please.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Throne of Jade</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/21/throne-of-jade/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/21/throne-of-jade/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Those men want to take Laurence from me, and put him in prison, and execute him, and I will not let them, ever, and I do not care if Laurence tells me not to squash you,&amp;quot; he added, fiercely, to Lord Barham.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Laurence and the British Government may think that Temeraire was won fairly under the articles of war&amp;hellip; but the Chinese aren&amp;rsquo;t so sure. In an effort to appease them, off Temeraire and Laurence go, halfway around the world to see if they can&amp;rsquo;t convince them otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a number of parts to really like about this book: Getting to travel the world is neat. The difference of Chinese culture, especially around dragons is fun. I like the idea of basically a Napoleonic era aircraft carrier for dragons. There are other related big beasties in the world as well!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The discussions about slavery, the differences in culture between the British and Chinese, and what that might mean for dragons were fascinating. Especially having read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/">A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians&lt;/a> not &lt;em>that&lt;/em> long ago, it was interesting to see another take on the same period&amp;ndash;especially when we randomly get news that Pitt has died.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course, the aforequoted relationship between Temeraire and Laurence. That&amp;rsquo;s really a great part of the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a downside, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit less action packed than the first book. We get a couple of big fights, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, but it&amp;rsquo;s got a low slower pace. A bit jarring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Vision</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/20/ultimate-vision/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/20/ultimate-vision/</guid><description>&lt;p>The idea of Vision is pretty cool. One to remember and to warn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea that no one else has beaten Galactus is… nonsensical? Bit comics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vision… with a rather female form is an interesting choice. No reason not to choose either over the other when approaching Earth. But I expect that’s not why they (the writers/illustrators) did it…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-vision-textbundle-45ad5c.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now we get a quick aside with A.I.M. and a left behind splinter of Galactus. Neat story, if likely inconsequential to anything else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Galactus, Volume 3: Extinction</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/18/ultimate-galactus-volume-3-extinction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/18/ultimate-galactus-volume-3-extinction/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it ends. Galactus is here, ready to destroy the Earth and everything on it. It’s going to take Ultimates, Fantastic Four, and X-Men alike to save the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But at what future cost?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit sudden of an end and in prefer the setup of the previous two volumes, but it’s still solid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a number of potential far future issues laid out here. Curious what comes back to bite humanity’s collective behind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Galactus, Volume 2: Secret</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/18/ultimate-galactus-volume-2-secret/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/18/ultimate-galactus-volume-2-secret/</guid><description>&lt;p>First, we learned something was coming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we get a hint at what it’s coming to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Hint: ☠️)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s pretty cool seeing the Ultimates and Fantastic Four team up this time. No X-Men though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Galactus, Volume 1: Nightmare</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/17/ultimate-galactus-volume-1-nightmare/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/17/ultimate-galactus-volume-1-nightmare/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh my.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>100 years ago &lt;strong>something&lt;/strong> exploded over Tunguska.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few days ago, the world started dreaming of death.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now a team of Ultimates and another of X-Men are going to get some answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This can’t possibly go wrong.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 12: Hard Lessons</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/16/ultimate-x-men-vol.-12-hard-lessons/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/16/ultimate-x-men-vol.-12-hard-lessons/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quick one.

&lt;p>Bit on the name with that title’s reference, no?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, of course the X-Men have to come to the rescue… even if they’ve been explicitly told not to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A decent volume. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Weddings and Witchcraft</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/15/weddings-and-witchcraft/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Apr 2023 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/15/weddings-and-witchcraft/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>gasp&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We actually get to cycle back to a previous main character?! And not one, but two of them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, Laurel and Marigold are getting married! Yay for them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of the story deals with the stress that comes with planning and dealing with an upcoming wedding&amp;ndash;totally get that&amp;ndash;along with a mysterious and magical saboteur&amp;ndash;that was a fun twist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;re my favorites of this series&amp;rsquo; characters and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see some closure for them. I really feel books 1, 2, and 5 could have been made into a single novel, with an emphasis on the cozy on account of no &amp;lsquo;huge&amp;rsquo; big bads throughout the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, an enjoyable read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On to something bigger!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>His Majesty's Dragon</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/15/his-majestys-dragon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Apr 2023 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/15/his-majestys-dragon/</guid><description>&lt;p>TLDR: Well that&amp;rsquo;s unexpected. Originally (8 years ago), I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thrilled. Enough to DNF the series (although not the book). On a reread (+relisten?), I loved it and am looking forward to more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>8 years ago, I first read Temeraire. I thought the idea was fascinating. An alternate history set around the time of Napoleon, tied fairly closely to our own world. Only: Dragons! Cool, no? And turns out&amp;hellip; it is pretty cool!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yet somehow, I managed to find myself annoyed by the mechanics of dragons, their intelligence, and&amp;ndash;for some reason&amp;ndash;the idea that there was a &amp;lsquo;chosen one&amp;rsquo; trope going on? I feel like I must have mellowed out somewhat in age. Or decided that I like almost everything now. Or read enough &lt;em>really&lt;/em> good Naomi Novik that I wanted to give it another try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that one big difference this time was listening to the audiobook. Some books just work better that way&amp;ndash;something about the book picking you up and carrying you along, where it&amp;rsquo;s easier to just keep listening rather than having to work at it. This is definitely one of them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 14: Warriors</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/14/ultimate-spider-man-volume-14-warriors/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/14/ultimate-spider-man-volume-14-warriors/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that’s quite the cast. Hammerhead is apparently not dead and trying to elbow in on Fisk’s territory. Enemy of my enemy … is actually still a pretty bad dude?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-spider-man-v14-textbundle-9bb091.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course Moon Knight, Iron Fist, Elektra, and Black Cat get involved. Oh that’s a busy few days in New York.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fun story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data and Divination</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/14/data-and-divination/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/14/data-and-divination/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another book, another point of view. This time a bit more distant in Jasmina (and Larch), witches who&amp;rsquo;ve managed to escape a cult-like witchy family (one a long time ago and the other just now, being the main point of the story).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see a bit more of the world that Buchanan is building and the idea of Divination applying to technology / computer searches is pretty fun. But like all of the books here, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>far&lt;/em> too short to actually get into anything. I want to see more of the family they escaped from. I want to see more of the fae (introduced and problem solved in &lt;em>literally&lt;/em> a paragraph this time).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps such a short form is not for me after all. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still a decent book and it was interesting to see it tie into the Laurel&amp;rsquo;s world&amp;ndash;and how different the two are&amp;ndash;eventually. Onward to the lastward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Fantastic Four, Volume 6: Frightful</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/13/ultimate-fantastic-four-volume-6-frightful/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/13/ultimate-fantastic-four-volume-6-frightful/</guid><description>&lt;p>Time travel! That never goes well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Zombies! Also not great.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lovecraftian chest busters! Now you’re just making things up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot to put in one volume one again, but perhaps my favorite Fantastic Four thus far. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Phoenix Extravagant</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/12/phoenix-extravagant/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/12/phoenix-extravagant/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Jebi was torn between saying &amp;lsquo;You are embarrassing me&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;I am going to take up my brush and make a painting of you that they will talk about for the next 10,000 years&amp;rsquo;. They said neither.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A world chock full of the history of China/Japan/China of a hundred years and change ago. Racism, colonialism, occupation, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A major take on artists during war. Both from the main character Gyen Jebi, an artist who fails to pass the examination for the Ministry of Art&amp;ndash;and ends up the perhaps much more interesting Ministry of Armor, making magical automata for the government. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating seeing a relatively common job turned extraordinary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course, the mechanical dragon on the cover. Arazi. &lt;span class="spoiler">Who is also a philosopher and pacifist, because of course they are.&lt;/span>
. There&amp;rsquo;s always something fun about relatively non-human characters like that. Probably the coolest part of teh book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course of course, there&amp;rsquo;s love. The relationship between Jebi and their captors, Vei especially. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting seeing the people who are perhaps all the more aware of the situation at hand and their relationships with the at times amusingly clueless Jebi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, an interesting book. I like the magic of the setting and the characters. The ending felt a little weird and weak, but it did wrap up well enough I suppose.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Time travel, parallel universes, super zombies, and Atlantis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is so much to fit into a single volume. No idea what will stick, but any one of those could carry a dozen volumes if not a series of their own… and they just keep doing it. Issue after issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Slow down!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>New art. New baddie (once again fallout of the Baxter Building policies). Not the easiest story to follow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-fantastic-four-v4-ba46d0.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Instead, a body swap story with Wolverine (hilarious), getting to meet Johnny Storm who is just trying to be normal (best Fantastic Four story thus far!), and a dreamy (but in the nightmare sort of way) introduction to Doctor Strange.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All that in six issues/a single volume.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;hellip; in the same way you know perfectly well you ought to stop reading and go to bed and you’ll feel hideously groggy in the morning if you don’t, and yet you keep going.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Wow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back when I first started &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/13/a-deadly-education/">A Deadly Education&lt;/a>, all we &lt;em>really&lt;/em> knew was El and the Scholomance. A magic school that seemed to be going whole hog into the &amp;lsquo;what doesn&amp;rsquo;t kill you makes you stronger&amp;rsquo; style of teaching. El managed to not only survive, but thrive. And in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/16/the-last-graduate/">The Last Graduate&lt;/a>, things seem to actually be going &lt;em>well&lt;/em>. It all worked out. &lt;em>Everyone&lt;/em>¹ is free, half the world&amp;rsquo;s monsters are dead, El has the book that will teach her how to set up perfect independent Golden Enclaves, and the Scholomance has claimed it&amp;rsquo;s last victims.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>¹Except Orion. Stupid boy (not my words) refused to come out.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Also I hadn&amp;rsquo;t lost an ounce of the passionate desire to beat him over the head with a large stick, and surely that was a sign of true love.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And oh. There&amp;rsquo;s also some crazy dark malificer out there knocking down Enclaves left and right. The biggest monsters are coming for the wizards&amp;hellip; and only El can deal with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a lot of ways, that book did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> go ways that I expected it to. It&amp;rsquo;s so much darker and terrible and yet at the same time more &amp;lsquo;human&amp;rsquo; than I ever expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re all greedy, but children make it easier to be. We feel it&amp;rsquo;s only right to give them everything we can grab, even when you know that anything you feed your own child still comes out of someone else&amp;rsquo;s mouth.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>El, on the other hand, is &lt;em>so done&lt;/em> with all that after what she&amp;rsquo;s already been through. She&amp;rsquo;s going to save the world&amp;ndash;and &lt;em>she&lt;/em> is going to pay the price for it this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because that&amp;rsquo;s what she does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a satisfying conclusion to one of the best new series I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a long time. I&amp;rsquo;m saddened that it&amp;rsquo;s over, but it ended well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>That’s really it in a nutshell. Van Damme is back with changes of his own.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s quick, cute, and light on the action.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mostly, we get another point of view (Laurel&amp;rsquo;s cousin Mildred, the &amp;lsquo;fibre witch&amp;rsquo;). It was a bit jarring at first, I&amp;rsquo;m not always the best at similar names and really thought it was Marigold and I&amp;rsquo;d missed something big&amp;hellip; but no, it&amp;rsquo;s just a different character each time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The characterization and plot remains cozy, with fun little experiments each time. This time, we have a much more rural life with &lt;em>alpacas&lt;/em>! And of course a new neighbor to date (&lt;span class="spoiler">gay and trans this time&lt;/span>
). And a mystery to solve&amp;hellip; that doesn&amp;rsquo;t end up mattering overmuch?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, they&amp;rsquo;re nice quick reads as a palette cleanser. I miss Laurel and Marigold (they show up for a bit, but it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t count). But we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes from here!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A quick introduction to Mister Sinister… and perhaps someone even more sinister behind the curtains?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A decent story.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“You’re creating hell. And you’re putting yourself inside it.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NEMESIS-1’s tone was serene. “Hell is the optimal solution.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/21/the-outside/">The Outside&lt;/a>, humanity found something Outside of the Gods&amp;rsquo; influence and managed to tear apart a large part of the world of Jai. In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/28/the-fallen/">The Fallen&lt;/a>, they learned to live with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/the-infinite/">The Infinite&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s time to learn more about the Gods themselves&amp;ndash;what they really are and how they came to be&amp;hellip; and perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s time for the Gods&amp;rsquo; reigns to end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating story and, in my opinion, perhaps the best of the trilogy. At once, we get answers for just what lead to the world that the characters live in now&amp;ndash;while at the same time opening so many more questions. What happened in the 700 years between the earliest and latest points of view in the book? What&amp;rsquo;s going on in the rest of the universe? And what happens next?!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But so far as this single story, it&amp;rsquo;s finished and well done. I always do applaud authors able to do that.&lt;/p>

It is an odd time of year to be reading a Christmas Treasury. But &lt;em>i&lt;/em> has been insisting on stories out of this book over and over again, so I figured I might as well write it down.

&lt;p>Things have been rough for the X-Men, what with the whole Magneto thing (again) and anti-Mutant feelings running high. So of course what do we need? More mutants!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Angel. Emma Frost. Dazzler. Alex Summers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s cool to see so many new (old) faces and shake up the status quo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’ll just have to see what’s next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing particularly special about this volume but also not terrible.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The way to a man’s heart is through his chest!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Another day, another Culture novel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After how much I liked &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/26/the-player-of-games/">Player of Games&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting how much less I got into Use of Weapons. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s the setting and main character&amp;ndash;Zakalwe is closer to Horza than Gurgeh. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s the structure&amp;ndash;with one set of chapters going forward in time, one going backward, and a prologue and epilogue after either of them, it&amp;rsquo;s complicated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not a bad book. The Culture is a fascinating setting and getting into the darker corners is exactly where you learn the most about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Zakalwe, in all human societies we have ever reviewed, in every age and every state, there has seldom if ever been a shortage of eager young males prepared to kill and die to preserve the security, comfort and prejudices of their elders, and what you call heroism is just an expression of this simple fact; there is never a scarcity of idiots.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Worth reading as a continuation of the Culture, but probably not one I&amp;rsquo;ll revisit. Such is life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 10: Hollywood</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/01/ultimate-spider-man-volume-10-hollywood/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/01/ultimate-spider-man-volume-10-hollywood/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-spider-man-v10-629af4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Oh yes. That is Toney McGwire and (this real) Spider-Man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea that Octavius is on the run again and that the film crews got it all—and made to use that as footage in the Sam Raimi Spider-Man film? Oh that’s hilarious.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reed, Sue, Johnny. Ben back at school. The gangs all here!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have to admit, but a branch of the Marvel Universe I’m that familiar with. Looking forward to finding out!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course the first thing that has to happen is the accident…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a bit quick we don’t really get time to even know Reed Richards, let alone the rest of them. I expect they’ll get some time to breathe as the series goes on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise, it’s a weird mix of science and pseudo history. Pretty weird.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Huh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I expected some version of the Sinister Six, but to have it be an Ultimates/Spider-Man crossover? Pretty cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some serious mental issues at play here and only mostly on the villains side. Likewise questionable choices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the good guys all get to go home in the end, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right?&lt;/p>

Much more breathing room last year than the year before (two weeks!) and I&amp;rsquo;ve already been reading more this year, so I&amp;rsquo;m confident. Let&amp;rsquo;s do it.
As a side note, if anyone I know wants to read along on any of these, drop me a line. Love to chat about books. 😄
Rules:
Must be speculative fiction (SF, fantasy, horror with speculative elements) Limit the number of novellas (fewer than 40k words or defined by the author as such) or combine them A book of short stories counts Graphic novels/manga should be treated as novellas Web novels count (if they&amp;rsquo;re long enough) Audiobooks count Official thread</description></item><item><title>Microscopes and Magic</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/31/microscopes-and-magic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2023 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/31/microscopes-and-magic/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much more of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/03/succulents-and-spells/">Succulents and Spells&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s quick, doesn&amp;rsquo;t really go anywhere (huge), and is a fun little read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the plus side, I like seeing more of Marigold as the primary point of view. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird to swap, but I think I like her more than Laurel. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because she&amp;rsquo;s just coming into the magical world?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the downside&amp;hellip; the (a?) big bad is maginanotech bugs. And there&amp;rsquo;s really no justification for nanotech just &lt;em>existing&lt;/em> in this world. I generally only like one real &amp;lsquo;give&amp;rsquo; to a story and this is a bit much. Especially when it could totally just be magical and that would be fine. Even magical bioengineering would be better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such is life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s cute and if you liked the first, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably like this. I&amp;rsquo;m curious what in the world is next&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Adventures: One Tin Soldier</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/31/ultimate-adventures-one-tin-soldier/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2023 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/31/ultimate-adventures-one-tin-soldier/</guid><description>&lt;p>So… Hawk-Owl. Right. Big time Batman parody, no?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/one-tin-soldier-b46cd4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s an introduction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/one-tin-soldier-aa9c84.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And… that’s a backstory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He’s rich and fights crime in a winged outfit. And has an adopted boy sidekick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s cute. The big bad is so weird. The characters are one dimensional and not great people. I’m not really sure why it’s a thing other than a weird Ultimates cameo that doesn’t go anywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 8: Cats &amp; Kings</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/30/ultimate-spider-man-volume-8-cats-kings/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/30/ultimate-spider-man-volume-8-cats-kings/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whoo boy. Fisk is back and of course Spider-Man can’t let that stand. He (Spider-Man) really does need to find a way to deal with him (Kingpin) before he (Spider-Man) ends up dealt with… violently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along the way, we get a bit more humanity from Jameson, a new mysterious (ish) opponent/ally? in Black Cat, and a bit more Elektra. Good times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really do prefer these more ongoing story lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mighty Jack</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/28/mighty-jack/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/28/mighty-jack/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s just a lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kid friendly graphic novel about a young boy named Jack with a single mother working multiple jobs to keep everything afloat and a non-verbal autistic kid sister (Maddy) that he helps take care of. That&amp;rsquo;s already a bunch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we haven&amp;rsquo;t even gotten to the point where they trade the family car for some magic beans (get it? Jack?), grow a crazy magical farm, befriend homeschooled neighborhood girl Lily, and adventures ensue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a great time and I really do appreciate the increased variety of characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, well worth a read and the children enjoy it as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Fallen</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/28/the-fallen/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/28/the-fallen/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ooh boy. After &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/21/the-outside/">The Outside&lt;/a> set up the world and characters, ending with &amp;rsquo;the Outside&amp;rsquo; coming in and wrecking havoc on the planet Jai, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what was next but I surely wanted to find out&amp;hellip; I even noted in that review that there were sequels, and yet somehow I never got around to reading them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did now. This is a wonderfully weird (at times) ride into what happened next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once again, I think that one thing that the Fallen does well is dealing with all manner of diversity (particularly in the neuro- space). People are people. And it really makes you think: what if we actually could live in a society where people just expect to meet others where they are and &lt;em>that&amp;rsquo;s okay&lt;/em>. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses and things that make their skin crawl. And &lt;em>that&amp;rsquo;s okay&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see a book really dig into that, all along the backdrop of super powerful AI &amp;lsquo;Gods&amp;rsquo;, their Angels (who have issues all thier own), and monsters (who, it turns out, are sometimes people as well, just a fair bit further away from the &amp;rsquo;norm&amp;rsquo;) from outside space and time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a really solid sequel. Honestly, I loved it even more than the first book. Well, well worth a read. I really look forward to what&amp;rsquo;s next.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 7: Blockbuster</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/28/ultimate-x-men-vol.-7-blockbuster/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/28/ultimate-x-men-vol.-7-blockbuster/</guid><description>&lt;p>The one that starts digging into Logan’s issues. And oh does he have issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Best part:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-x-men-v7-c53993.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good part of the story is Spider-Man and Wolverine teaming up. That’s just wonderful. I really enjoy the contrast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-x-men-v7-fcbbf8.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Daredevil! Even if not much. Good times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like the longer stories that, while having some self contained parts, are really part of a larger story. In this case: who was Logan and where (when?) did he come from?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
