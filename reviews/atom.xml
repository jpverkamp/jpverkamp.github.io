      <description>Fortune telling, Constantine’s father, more evil demons and arguably worse angels, and of course dead soldiers who can’t find rest.
Not a standout volume, but still pretty good.
The Nature of the Beast Sure…
Reading the future is a common enough trope in this genre, but I enjoyed it.
Walking the Dog Another ghost story&amp;hellip;
…ish.
Oops. A neat twist.

      <description>I do a post each year on books, but this year I also started reviewing movies and TV shows! I have absolutely no idea how much value people get out of this (and I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you), but I enjoy doing it, so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to stop any time soon. :D
In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s been a good year for movies and TV!
Overall, I watched:
  55 movies</description>

      <title>2021 Reading Retrospective</title>
      <link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/2021-reading-retrospective/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well. That was a year. Covid, take 2. A new job. A new baby. I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite make my 200 books this year (I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite even make it to 1/2 days), but that&amp;rsquo;s okay. I still read a giant pile. :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some stats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;179 books read: 1 every 2.04 days (almost!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;47,236 pages read: roughly 130 pages/day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;29 audiobooks, 96 graphic novels, 18 children&amp;rsquo;s chapter books, 18 non-fiction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;56 unique authors (top were Hajime Isayama, Patricia Briggs, Warren Ellis, and Neil Gaiman)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;19 series (top were Attack on Titan, Mercy Thompson/Alpha &amp;amp; Omega, Sandman, and Runelords)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortest: &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/21/the-shepherds-tale/&#34;&gt;The Shepherd&amp;#39;s Tale&lt;/a&gt; with 56 pages, longest: &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/the-holy-bible-revised-standard-version-catholic-edition/&#34;&gt;The Holy Bible: Revised Standard Version, Catholic Edition&lt;/a&gt; with over 1000. That feels like cheating though, so let&amp;rsquo;s go with &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/21/rhythm-of-war/&#34;&gt;Rhythm of War&lt;/a&gt; at 1270 / &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/12/crafting-interpreters/&#34;&gt;Crafting Interpreters&lt;/a&gt; at 865. 😄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most read book I read this year was &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/23/1984/&#34;&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt; with 5 million others reading it (on Goodreads alone; I was working on my earliest backlog). Least popular: &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/26/tales-of-nezura-book-1-the-zevolra/&#34;&gt;Tales of Nezura: Book 1: The Zevolra&lt;/a&gt; with only 39. It &amp;hellip; wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad. Give it a try?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I gave 119 five-star ratings, 45 four-star, 7 three-star, and less than 10 other ratings. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the realization over the last year that I tend to like just about everything. Books in particular, they&amp;rsquo;re only on my list if I think I&amp;rsquo;d find them interesting, so of course, they&amp;rsquo;ll be rated highly&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Two big stories, a few really trippy dreams, and Constantine managing to push off damnation a bit longer. A neat collection. Critical Mass in particular is worth the read.
In Another Part of Hell Chas’ mother… quite a figure.
Warped Notions Part One: The Delicate Power of Terror Allllll right then.
Same thing.
Part Two: The Everything Virus They’re really going into the weird this time around…
Part Three: The Shout He’s figuring it out!</description>

      <description>No. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to review the Bible.
I did however, read the entire Bible this year (for the second time, first time with the additional Catholic books). This time around, guided by the excellent Bible in a Year podcast hosted by Fr. Mike Schmitz.
Over the course of the year, it goes through every single book in the Bible in a fairly well thought out order&amp;ndash;which certainly does make you realize just how much more of the Old Testament there is&amp;hellip; (For context, the OT is 3x as long as the NT.</description>

      <title>The Matrix Resurrections</title>

      <description>Whoa.
 Well that&amp;rsquo;s a blast of nostalgia, a bunch of mind-bending meta universe building, some awesome new characters, a few solid action scenes, and overall quite an action movie. I loved it.
It&amp;rsquo;s been more than 20 years. I have seen the original Matrix more times than I can easily remember and loved both sequels (even if they didn&amp;rsquo;t shine quite as bright). When they said they were making another one&amp;hellip; I had no idea how in the world they were going to make that possibly work.</description>

      <description>As much as I loved Spider-Man: Homecoming, Spider-Man: Far From Home takes what made it great and turns it up a few levels even further.
One one level, you have Spider-Man being Spider-Man. He&amp;rsquo;s a good kid, trying to make his way in life, trying to deal with the dual life of being a highschooler and being a superhero&amp;ndash;of saving the world and perhaps getting the girl.
And then you layer all the weight of the greater MCU on top of it.</description>

      <description>I was raised so damn Dominican Spanish my first language bachata a reminder of the power of my body plánto &amp;amp; salami for years before I ever tasted peanut butter &amp;amp; jelly sandwhicches. If you asked me what I was, &amp;amp; you meant in terms of culture, I&#39;d say Dominican. No hesitation, no question about it. Can you be from a place you have never been? You can find the island stamped all over me, but what would the island find if I was there?</description>

      <description>That is a truly delightful Spider-Man movie. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird seeing him introduced after the events of Captain America: Civil War and completely skipping how he became Spider-Man in the first place&amp;hellip; but it works. I really like the entire plot, dealing with the fallout of the Avengers / super-hero activity and how normal people try to live their lives around it&amp;ndash;and what happens when the powers that be step in and take that away from them.</description>

      <description>The Wheel of Time turns, and ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of time.</description>

    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/hawkeye.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed Hawkeye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;, which compared to &lt;em&gt;Wandvision&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; and really even &lt;em&gt;What If&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; is a worthwhile goal and really does a lot to show off the more human scale of superheroes. It&amp;rsquo;s never really made much sense that Hawkeye and Black Widow were Avengers&amp;hellip; and it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t. But they do it anyways. Because what Heroes do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see them building up the new &amp;lsquo;Young Avengers&amp;rsquo; and branching out as much as they are. I think Hailee Steinfeld did a great job, especially when acting against &lt;span class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;Florence Pugh&#39;s Yelena&lt;/span&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that&amp;rsquo;s music. I can only imagine hearing that on a theater scale sound system. Although my home sound bar certainly tried it&amp;rsquo;s best&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I know I&amp;rsquo;m behind the times. Better late than never?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a solid movie that tries to make some big points about everyone having value / sticking it to the people that hate you because you&amp;rsquo;re different and&amp;hellip; mostly hitting the mark? It gets even more complicated when you read up on Barnum&amp;rsquo;s actual history. Very much a serial &amp;lsquo;get rich quick&amp;rsquo;er with some questionable ethics, but there&amp;rsquo;s good parts there as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh boy. This one really dug into the darker parts of character growth. Elliot finds new ways to be even crazier, Angela is&amp;hellip; off the rails entirely, Moustache Guy (Bobby Cannavale/Irvin) is awesome, and the entire plot of Darlene, Dominque, and the FBI was fascinating to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep being pleasantly surprised with where this show keeps going. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have expected them to make it past the first season plotwise&amp;hellip; yet here we are. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to where we can go from here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, that is a really solid movie. I know a lot of people prefer Empire, but for whatever reason, I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked Return of the Jedi more. That holds true even more, although I have to say that there are a few (possibly nostalgia fueled) particulars that I like more before the special editions changed things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Where Sons of the Oak could arguably considered a continuation of the first four books, what with references and plots revolving around the Earth King and his wife and a focus on Borenson, Myrrima, and their children, now in Worldbinder we&amp;rsquo;re really getting into the changes&amp;ndash;and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m okay with that.
For one, the first real &amp;lsquo;binding of worlds&amp;rsquo; happens fairly early in the book. In a nutshell, that means that any character alive in both worlds is now a mix of memories, experiences, et al of both characters, while those only in one are initially weaker for it.</description>

      <description>Cute enough. For the most part, it&amp;rsquo;s more Pippi stories, but they do finally get out of the town and go with Pippi and her father to the South Seas island where her father is king. Which&amp;hellip; is both the best and worst part of the book. It&amp;rsquo;s zany and fun in true Pippi fashion, but it&amp;rsquo;s also horribly imperialistic/racist. It&amp;rsquo;s still a fun book, but definitely a product of the times.</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woo! Big icy battles on land in and the sky/space around Hoth, training with a real (short) Jedi Master (and they&amp;rsquo;re all supposed to be dead), meetings between old friends&amp;ndash;who may not be too thrilled about losing in cards all those years ago&amp;ndash;another confrontation between Luke and Vadar, and the big bad reveal.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that&amp;rsquo;s a truly bizarre adaptation of the Nutcracker. Or I suppose all of the other versions are bizarre, given that this is supposed to be as &amp;lsquo;close as possible&amp;rsquo; to the original Maurice Sendak version.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>There was a lot of potential in this episode, with two longer storylines&amp;ndash;one the continuation of the angels/devil storyline we&amp;rsquo;ve been dealing with for a while. But unfortunately, outside of a few very cool/trippy visuals it was a surprisingly quiet volume. A lot of human trouble, not enough supernatural craziness. Less moping at least, but without a real transition (at least in my opinion). Not terrible, but certainly one of the weaker entries in the series.</description>

      <description>Well that was delightful. One of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;m really glad for the 2021 Book Bingo. I don&amp;rsquo;t know when/if I would have found this book, if not for that, and I really quite enjoyed it. It&amp;rsquo;s got great steampunky worldbuilding (with some hints of body horror I honestly feel steampunk should probably have more of), royal/courtly intrigue, wonderful characters, and some delightful writing (with a French twist to the word choices that I don&amp;rsquo;t see much of).</description>

      <description>Another solid volume. In particular, there&amp;rsquo;s another volume about angels/demons/and the troubles they get into. It&amp;rsquo;s not quite as good as the one in Bloodlines, but still enjoyable. An interesting take on Gabriel, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure.
End of the Line Family trouble…
… of the magical kind.
Both ways:
Forty … years old and all alone. Until:
Now that’s a party. Oh my. They even got Swamp Thing.</description>

      <description>You know, I was actually pleasantly surprised by Bambi II (later retitled). And not only because they got Patrick Stewart of all people to voice Bambi&amp;rsquo;s dad (who now has to step up and be a single father). It&amp;rsquo;s as cute a story as Bambi was&amp;ndash;which the kids&#39; appreciated&amp;ndash;but with just a bit more depth&amp;ndash;which I did. It&amp;rsquo;s still certainly not high cinema, but it&amp;rsquo;s not terrible either.
Onward!</description>

      <description>A very solid issue. A couple of great longer storylines with long term consequences (Guys &amp;amp; Dolls was great) and a few shorter one offs (Lord of the Dance in particular I enjoyed). Could have been longer, but there’s still potentially more story to be told there.
I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying seeing Constantine and Kit&amp;rsquo;s relationship evolve. It gives a nice human element to contrast the horror. I only hope that doesn&amp;rsquo;t go too badly for her in the long run&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>You know, I&amp;rsquo;m always up for a good &amp;lsquo;writing an interpreter&amp;rsquo; book. Making programming languages is a thing I&amp;rsquo;ve done a number of times before and really have been itching to get back into again. Add to that a desire to pick up a bit more Go syntax&amp;hellip; well, perhaps this book is just about perfect.
In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;lsquo;writing an interpreter&amp;rsquo; book. They go through lexing, parsing, and evaluating.</description>

      <description>ONCE UPON A TIME, in a land that was called Britain, these things happened.
 This is an odd one to review. It&amp;rsquo;s well written, decently paced (although I found it slow in general), and&amp;ndash;so far as I know&amp;ndash;well researched for the time period. On the other hand, I tend strongly to prefer fantasy and science fiction (which this is not, despite all the hints at the contrary) and a little more action.</description>

      <description>Bambi is a surprisingly tricky movie to review, mostly since it relies on who&amp;rsquo;s doing the reviewing. From my perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s cute enough, but there&amp;rsquo;s next to nothing there. It&amp;rsquo;s just a bunch of cute animated animals running around for an hour. From my kids&#39; perspectives though&amp;hellip; they loved it. They were laughing out loud at the cartoon antics and cuddled right in during the storm and hunt scenes.</description>

      <description>Weird, slow, and dark at first but then we get the Deadly Habits storyline. That’s one of the core Constantine storylines so far as I know and for good reason.
The Bogeyman Oh Constantine. What is going on with you. Dark and depressing and little happening. Sets up a story I suppose.
Dead-Boy’s Heart That’s a great issue. Took me a bit to realize it was typing Constantine. So he’s always been … a little different.</description>

      <description>All leaves must fall in time, she had said. The lives we lived fall away from us, but something remains, something that is part of the tree.
 That one actually took me rather a while to get through. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, the worldbuilding is still facinating, the action is top notch, and we still get more than a bunch of all the main characters. But somehow&amp;ndash;it seems to have lost it&amp;rsquo;s focus.</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lady Jessica Atreides: I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings obliteration. I will face my fear and I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past&amp;hellip; I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. That&amp;rsquo;s a movie with &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; a sense of scale and granduer. The ships are huge, the worms are huge, the armies are huge, the Duke is honorable, the Fremen are pious, the Baron is gross, everything is spectacular. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a bummer that we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to wait a few years for Part 2, but I think it really did need the space to breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worldbuilding and visuals are what really makes this movie. I watched it on HBOMax, rather than in theaters, but I do have a wall sized projected screen and that really does help. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a visually stunning movie. If they re-run Part 1 in theaters, I may have to check it out next time around&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I actually liked this story a lot more than the first Pippi. It&amp;rsquo;s still basically the same idea: girl who is unusually strong and lives on her own gets up to hijinks, but I think that the stories this time around fit a little bit&amp;ndash;and we actually get to meet Pippi&#39;s dad--turns out he&#39;s not dead after all .
Worth continuing on. Going to have to check out the third now.</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Season 1 wrapped up, where do you even go from there? They finished their big goal. Dealing with the fallout is the obvious answer&amp;hellip; or ramping things up even further. We get a bit of both in Season 2, mostly with even more big twists from Elliot&amp;rsquo;s entirely confusing mind but also a plot that is both deeper and more terrifying than I would have thought at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not quite as solid as Season 1, in most part because it&amp;rsquo;s not quite as new and fresh. But it&amp;rsquo;s still very good and well worth the watch. Whatever shall we learn in Season 3?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sons of the Oak is an odd one. After saving the world in Lair of Bones, Gaborn and Iome are loaded with enough metabolism to curse them to die in the next few years&amp;ndash;which ends up happening relatively early on. That of course leaves a power vacuum. There are those who would love to see the Earth King&amp;rsquo;s son take the crown&amp;ndash;and just as many who&amp;rsquo;d rather see him dead and take power of their on. On top of that, there&amp;rsquo;s a whole new level of darkness in the world. From Loci to strengi-saats, it&amp;rsquo;s an ever darkening world, with the Torch of Humanity having been passed down to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve actually finished this book before. The time skip made it hard to read and I just moved on. But this time around, I&amp;rsquo;ve actually really enjoyed it. We&amp;rsquo;ll have to see how it continues. I think reading it as an audiobook has helped. It just keeps going unless you actually stop rather than stopping unless you push on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There it is. A New Hope. The Star Wars I grew up on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man that&amp;rsquo;s a great opening. The scale of the Star Destroyer, dumping us in on the &amp;lsquo;everyman&amp;rsquo; droids, and that Vadar scene. Spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenge of the Sith is a somewhat fascinating story. It feels by far the darkest and most &amp;lsquo;adult&amp;rsquo; of the prequel trilogy, probably best matching the feel of A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back, but at the same time, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more humor in the early parts at least, with some truly weird and silly moments with R2 and the Battle Droids. You know&amp;hellip; I just don&amp;rsquo;t understand the droids. I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to that in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is just delightful&amp;ndash;and a blast of nostalgia on top of that. I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to actually watch all of the Disney classic growing up (still haven&amp;rsquo;t), but I definiately watched this one. And now, after reading many of the stories to my children, it&amp;rsquo;s a delight to be able to share the video form with them as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like the style of these stories. It&amp;rsquo;s a mix of animated world with the real storybook characters (Pooh et al), but also obviously in a book, as they hob from page to page. It&amp;rsquo;s not the story of style you&amp;rsquo;d always expect to work, but it really works here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The things that I remember most about Attack of the Clones are the atmosphere of Kamino, the final battle on Genosis (mostly from the game Star Wars Battlefront), and some rather cringey burgeoning relationship dialog from Anakin and Padme.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The Lair of Bones
David Farland   The Lair of Bones is an epic and fitting conclusion1 to the Runeslords saga. It takes the story of Gaborn and Raj Ahten, of Runelords and reavers, of elemental powers and far darker things, and brings it all together in a series of rather epic journeys and battles, culminating with an epic&amp;ndash;if bittersweet&amp;ndash;victory of light over dark, of good over evil.

      <description>Pippi Longstocking&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an odd character. On one hand, she&amp;rsquo;s a fun loving young girl who happens to have super strength (for some reason). She&amp;rsquo;s lived a pretty crazy life and has stories from all over the world along with a tendency to get herself into (and back out of) wacky adventures and always seems to have a lot of fun doing so.
On the other hand, she&amp;rsquo;s a young girl living on her own.</description>

      <description>Luca is something of an odd beast. It&amp;rsquo;s a cute little movie about two young sea monster boys who journey out onto land&amp;ndash;where so long as they don&amp;rsquo;t get wet, they transform to look like humans. Wacky hijinks ensue, there&amp;rsquo;s a meetcute with a young girl, a big race scenes, some quickly resolved drama, and everyone lives happily ever after.
It&amp;rsquo;s not the most thrilling movie, which isn&amp;rsquo;t really something that you expect to see from Pixar&amp;ndash;if it had come from any other studio it would have been pretty impressive.</description>

      <description>Not terrible, but also not great. It starts very slowly with a hippie commune and takes a few issues to get going and gets downright weird at a few points. But enjoyable enough after that.
Onward!
Issue specific reviews, spoilers:
Touching the Earth Oh boy.
And then it goes all weird hippy commune. Sure? I don’t really get it. Imagine paying for this as a single issue…

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;60 years ago. Dang. And you know? It holds up. The action is solid and story aren&amp;rsquo;t overly complicated but enjoyable, the animation really works (despite/because of the limitations of the time), and the villains are unambiguous and scary but not overly so. Perhaps best of all, it&amp;rsquo;s the story of an absolute pile of talking dogs. What&amp;rsquo;s not to love?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, that opening score. The title crawl. That&amp;rsquo;s a blast of nostalgia right there. I&amp;rsquo;m too young to have seen the original trilogy in theaters, but I watched the VHS tapes what felt like a million times. When The Phantom Menace came out, that was &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; in my wheelhouse. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how many times I saw that movie in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? It&amp;rsquo;s not as bad as it&amp;rsquo;s often rated. Granted, if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t leaning so heavily on the rest of the Star Wars franchise, well&amp;hellip; it would probably be about that bad. But I disagree that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t disserve a place in the core &amp;lsquo;Skywalker Saga&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a fun action movie wrapped around the rise of dark powers and corruption in the guise of&amp;ndash;a trade war and senatorial discourse of all things. It&amp;rsquo;s weird, but I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to accept it at least?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obi-Wan: You were right about one thing master. The negotiations were short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s my favorite Star Wars movie so far&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and only a hint of things to come!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Elliott: I&amp;rsquo;m sorry this is an open and shut case of suicide and quite frankly Benny we are getting to the point where I have to ask you what we&amp;rsquo;re doing here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benoit Blanc: The method? Throat slit? Typical for a suicide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Elliott: Yes, I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s dramatic, but look around. I mean, the guy practical lives in a Clue board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that was a surprising yet great fun movie. In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s a murder mystery. Heir of the family is found dead&amp;ndash;apparent suicide. But things quickly become more complicated, with a detective (Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc with a hilarious southern drawl that still somehow works&amp;hellip;) anonymously hired to &amp;lsquo;get to the truth&amp;rsquo;. The family is a nightmare, everyone has a reason to have offed the old man&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding Nemo is a delightful children&amp;rsquo;s movie. It&amp;rsquo;s the story of a worrying dad (Marlin), a son (Nemo) trying to grow into his own self, the trouble that causes, and the lengths family can go through for one another.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hellblazer, Vol. 2: The Devil You Know</title>

      <description>Well that’s a ride. The continuation of the Swamp Thing sexy times storyline, some more backstory on how Constantine got to be how he is, Constantine all Arthurian (for some reason), and a straight up horror story.
Weaker than volume 1 but worth continuing to volume 3!
Sex and Death Starts where we left off, with Constantine out of body and the Swamp Thing doing his mating thing… That is not a plot line I care at all about.</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NONA GREY RAISES her head and regards her foe through midnight eyes. Perhaps
it is just the reflection of the torchlight but somewhere in their darkness
a red flame seems to burn. “I am my own cage.” She lifts her sword. “And I
have opened the door.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;35530652&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35530652.grey-sister&#34;&gt;Grey Sister&lt;/a&gt; takes the fantasy world&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with a magical school full of battle nuns that we started with in &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;25895524&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25895524.red-sister&#34;&gt;Red Sister&lt;/a&gt; and turns things up a notch. Nona isn&amp;rsquo;t hiding any more just how much she can do, which is causing just about as many problems as it solves. And halfway through the books, things really escalate once again, with politics and problems outside of the convent itself coming to bear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was not really what I expected. On one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s got the heart of a super hero origin story, with Billy Batson gaining powers, learning to use them (and not lose himself or his friends/family while doing so), and fighting the big bad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
