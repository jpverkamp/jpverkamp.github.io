Both Raiders of the lost Ark and The Last Crusade are far better films. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say Temple of Doom is bad, just lesser.
Actionwise, there&amp;rsquo;s a ton. Gun fights, bailing out a plane, tons of bugs, several fights in a mine, and a giant drop? There is barely time to breathe.
Real world ethicswise&amp;hellip; this is even worse than Raiders, which is saying something.</description></item><item><title>Orconomics</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/orconomics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/orconomics/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Not all who wander are lost; some are on quests.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That was a very strange book. More than anything, it felt like &amp;lsquo;what if all of the more &lt;em>game&lt;/em> parts of Dungeons and Dragons were real, what would that change about the world?&amp;rsquo;. Oh, and dig into the economics of it along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We literally have an adventuring industry with heroes funded by corporate interests buying stakes in the eventual loot. Some sort of &amp;rsquo;level&amp;rsquo; system where you can turn in records of kills for advancement. Noncombat Paper Carries (NPCs).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a D&amp;amp;D satire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the biggest weakness to me was more one of expectations. I actually expected it to go even more into the economics (that don&amp;rsquo;t really make &lt;em>any&lt;/em> sense) of a adventuring based society. It&amp;rsquo;s there, but it could have been so much more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, I did enjoy the book, it was a fun read and the sense of humor was on point. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to check out the sequels at some point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Robogenesis</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/robogenesis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/robogenesis/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And now the story begins for the last time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So. That hint that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t all over? That was just the beginning.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We are all expressions of our own minds, projected onto the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The idea that the AI that lead to the end of the world wasn&amp;rsquo;t a unique event&amp;ndash;just one that happened to go particularly sideways is a fascinating one. The story of people trying to rebuild in the ruins&amp;ndash;only for another war to sweep over what&amp;rsquo;s left is terrifying. And the &amp;lsquo;what comes next&amp;rsquo; of animal like machines, augmented humans, and self-aware / free robots is a fascinating basis for a story.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What is a mind, but a pattern? My mind or yours. Man or machine. Simply an arrangement of atoms. Each of us, a unique expression of the mind of the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Honestly, I still think that &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/27/robopocalypse/">Robopocalypse&lt;/a> could stand as it&amp;rsquo;s own&amp;ndash;and was the stronger book. But if it had to have a sequel, this was an interesting one. Now that we have it (and that I&amp;rsquo;ve read it!) I feel like we&amp;rsquo;re going to need at least one more. There are just so many ideas here, we need to go another step further!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But instead of the end, I’m pretty sure I found myself at the start of something.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hanging Tree</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/28/the-hanging-tree/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/28/the-hanging-tree/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Jeremy Beaumont-Jones had been lucky enough to be born rich. He wasn’t in the mad oligarch class but once you’re past a certain point, the sheer weight of your money sucks in wealth like a financial singularity. If you’re sensible enough not to blow it on race horses, cocaine or musical theatre, then it becomes a perpetual-motion money making machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The power of money&amp;ndash;and those with power of their own, which tends to lead to money in it&amp;rsquo;s own ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Peter getting caught right up to it, a favor called in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a whole mess of the posh/upper class world of London and all the problems that come with this&amp;ndash;and how much they expect to be able to pay their way out of anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It took the Fire Brigade a day and a half to secure the remains of the house enough to recover Crew Cut’s body, which was described by Dr Jennifer Vaughan as ‘suffering from crush trauma’ and by Dr Walid as ‘mostly flat’.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well. Almost anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoy seeing more of Guleed, both in her role as a cop but also her getting more into the magical world&amp;ndash;at least by proxy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see more of Lesley. That&amp;rsquo;s such a mess throughout all of these books&amp;ndash;and I really don&amp;rsquo;t know where we&amp;rsquo;re going from there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And to finally face off more literally face to face with the Faceless Man? Awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The plots and sudden resolutions continue in this book. At this point, I&amp;rsquo;m mostly used to it&amp;hellip; but only mostly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Once the telephone had been invented, it was only a matter of time before the police got in on the new technology and, first in Glasgow and then in London, the police box was born. Here a police officer in need of assistance could find a telephone link to Scotland Yard, a dry space to do “paperwork” and, in certain extreme cases, a life of adventure through space and time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s delightful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Robopocalypse</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/27/robopocalypse/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/27/robopocalypse/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I can only give you words. Nothing fancy. But this will have to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you&amp;rsquo;re reading it a year from now or a hundred years from now. By the end of the chronicle you will know that humanity carried the flame of knowledge into the terrible blackness of the unknown, to the very brink of annihilation. And we carried it back.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In the near future, thinking machines are even slightly more everywhere than they are now. Take it one step further along the road to true general AI&amp;hellip; and suddenly you go outright Skynet on the world. Robot Apocalypse. Get it?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The true knowledge is not &lt;em>in&lt;/em> the things, but in finding the connections &lt;em>between&lt;/em> the things.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This &amp;hellip; was perhaps not the best time to read this book, with the ever increasing advances in LLMs and chatbots leading to upheaval in all manner of fields of work, along with the current instability (to put it mildly) in the United States. I think I need more stability in books right now.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>To survive, humans will work together. Accept each other. For a moment, we are all equal. Backs against the wall, human beings are at their finest.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That being said, it was a fascinatingly structured book. From the very first chapter, we know humanity (or what&amp;rsquo;s left of it) eventually wins the war. Each chapter, we have comments like &amp;rsquo;this is the last record of X&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Y had a part to play yet&amp;rsquo; And as we go, the various plots cross and come together, sketching out the end of the world and what comes after.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I will murder you by the billions to give you immortality. I will set fire to your civilization to light your way forward. But know this: My species is not defined by your dying, but by your living.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating book and I think well worth the read&amp;hellip; and I&amp;rsquo;m curious where exactly the sequel can possibly go next without more of the same.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alcatraz Versus the Shattered Lens</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/26/alcatraz-versus-the-shattered-lens/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/26/alcatraz-versus-the-shattered-lens/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Impossible things are really rough to do, you know.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And man, Alcatraz does all manner of impossible things this time around. There&amp;rsquo;s wacky tech (like Teddy bear grenades and giant flying bats (not made of glass)), wacky situations (Alcatraz getting a major (temporary) promotion (of sorts)), and powers (a Talent for Being Bad at Math). Pretty much exactly what you&amp;rsquo;d expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And all along, we&amp;rsquo;re getting more about the world building, one thing that I always enjoy in Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s books. There definitely seems to be a connection between it all&amp;ndash;but exactly how it all works together and how that can make things go wrong&amp;hellip; well, that&amp;rsquo;s the story, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Structurally, my kids were absolutely thrilled by the chapter numbering. The books are terribly meta, referring to chapters that don&amp;rsquo;t exist (because of skipping numbers) and with notes and comments going back and forth. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to read and honestly kind of impressive that we&amp;rsquo;ve gone this far&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Boys, welcome to the wonderful world of talking to women about their feelings. As a handy primer, here are a few things you should know:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Women have feelings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will spend the next seventy years or so trying to guess what they&amp;rsquo;re feeling and why.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will be wrong most of the time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I like French Fries.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Alcatraz continues to fall for Bastille.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>She was absolutely beautiful. She had long blonde hair, kind of the shade of a bowl of mac and cheese. She was smiling a wide, genuine smile—which was rather the shape of a macaroni and cheese noodle. She seemed to radiate light, much like a bowl of mac and cheese might if you stuffed a lightbulb into it. Her skin was soft and squishy, like— Okay. Maybe I’m too hungry to be writing right now.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In a very Alcatraz sort of way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun book and quite an ending. Of all the things to Break&amp;hellip; Here we go, one more book from Alcatraz&amp;rsquo;s perspective / in the original series. We&amp;rsquo;ll have to see where it can possible go from here!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/24/indiana-jones-and-the-raiders-of-the-lost-ark/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/24/indiana-jones-and-the-raiders-of-the-lost-ark/</guid><description>&lt;p>It has been a long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve watched these movies, but man do they actually hold up. From the moment the score first hits, through all the adventure and action scenes, right up to that face melting(ly awesome!) conclusion? There&amp;rsquo;s a ton of nostalgia, granted, but I still think it holds up even so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an introduction, we have it all!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tomb robbing!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>[Indiana needs his bullwhip to swing across a chasm]&lt;br>
Indiana: Give me the whip.&lt;br>
Satipo: Throw me the idol.&lt;br>
[they both see a stone door closing]&lt;br>
Satipo: No time to argue! Throw me the idol, I&amp;rsquo;ll throw you the whip!&lt;br>
Indiana: [throws the idol] Give me the whip!&lt;br>
Satipo: [drops the whip] Adiós, señor.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A fear of snakes!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>[Upon opening the Well of the Souls and peering down]&lt;br>
Sallah: Indy, why does the floor move?&lt;br>
Indiana: Give me your torch.&lt;br>
[Indy takes the torch and drops it in, revealing hundreds of snakes all over floor of the Well of Souls]&lt;br>
Indiana: Snakes. Why&amp;rsquo;d it have to be snakes?&lt;br>
Sallah: Asps&amp;hellip; very dangerous. You go first.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A mostly grounded world (if larger than life), before edging into the fantastical!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Indiana: The Ark of the Covenant, the chest that the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments.&lt;br>
Major Eaton: What, you mean &lt;em>the&lt;/em> Ten Commandments?&lt;br>
Indiana: Yes, the actual Ten Commandments, the original stone tablets that Moses brought down from Mt. Horeb and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing&amp;hellip;&lt;br>
[the officers stare at him blankly]&lt;br>
Indiana: Didn&amp;rsquo;t any of you guys ever go to Sunday school?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Characterwise, Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones really makes the movie, but Karen Allens&amp;rsquo; Marion and John Rhys-Davies&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> are great supporting cast and man Ronald Lacey makes quite the villain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s a pulpy adventure film. The plot is about as clearly good guys (even if Indy is totally looting) versus bad guys, loaded with some awesome action scenes along the way, and a solid ending where the good guys win. And sometimes, that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what you want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a great fun movie. I&amp;rsquo;m going to rewatch them all now! (The original trilogy. I suppose I&amp;rsquo;ll have to watch the new ones too? We&amp;rsquo;ll see.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exhalation</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/22/exhalation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/22/exhalation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two years, two bingos, two &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/30/stories-of-your-life-and-others/">Five SFF Shorts&lt;/a>, both by Ted Chiang.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man I love his shorts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This one goes more scifi and deals more with time travel and parallel realities than the other (which had more scifi interacting with religion), but I love them both.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In particular, I &lt;em>The Merchant and the Alchemist&amp;rsquo;s Gate&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom&lt;/em> were my favorites. The eponymous &lt;em>Exhalation&lt;/em> was an interesting look at entropy. And &lt;em>The Lifestyle of Software Objects&lt;/em>, by far the longest, had the time to go even more through the development of the idea over years (in universe).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, I think that especially from this book, I find that I enjoy scifi more in shorts&amp;ndash;you have time to explore many more &lt;em>ideas&lt;/em> there&amp;ndash;and longer form in fantasy&amp;ndash;really digging into the worlds and characters more than the ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr></description></item><item><title>Agatha All Along</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/21/agatha-all-along/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/21/agatha-all-along/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh that was a delight. Take Agatha (and the general fallout of her created world) from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/19/wandavision/">WandaVision&lt;/a>, turn up the witchiness, and go on a magical mystical, somewhat terrifying adventure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating story and, honestly, if you would have left out a few scenes it would have worked perfectly well completely outside of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well. And at this point, that&amp;rsquo;s a strong point in its favor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man Kathryn Hawn does great in this. I loved the supporting witch cast, especially Aubrey Plaza. She does unsettling and off kilter so well. And Teen&amp;ndash;he was an interesting counterpoint. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about the worldbuilding around either Rio (Plaza) or Teen (Locke), those parts felt weird, but the actors were awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course&amp;hellip; &lt;strong>the song&lt;/strong> (I don&amp;rsquo;t see this version as spoilers, but some might).&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VnjYeJ5blxo" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Man that song has been stuck in my head for weeks now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I personally would have dropped the last half of the last episode, the penultimate really works better as a conclusion. This really doesn&amp;rsquo;t need a sequel (although apparently there will be a third show as a &amp;lsquo;TV trilogy&amp;rsquo; sort of thing?), but so it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr></description></item><item><title>Persephone Station</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/16/persephone-station/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/16/persephone-station/</guid><description>&lt;p>Space opera set on a backwater, mostly ignored planet with all sorts of secrets and corporate exploitation. Add in a cast of criminals and mercenaries and all sorts of characters that don&amp;rsquo;t get overmuch representation in the Sci-Fi of old (Lesbian, bi, and non-binary, oh my. And honestly, a cast of entirely women in the first place). And more than a touch of an exploration of Artificial General Intelligence&amp;ndash;possible even more relevant with the current scope and expansion of LLMs&amp;ndash;and you have quite a story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed it. It&amp;rsquo;s a mix of older tropes and newer characters. For the most part, the story went as I was expecting, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a bad thing. And it was a fun listen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think my biggest pain point is that if anything, Persephone Station tries to do too much. I particularly like books exploring truly alien aliens and machine minds&amp;ndash;and comparing and contrasting how they think and how we think about them thinking. There are hints of that here, but it could have been so much more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, I enjoyed it and think it worth a listen. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/11/the-southern-book-clubs-guide-to-slaying-vampires/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/11/the-southern-book-clubs-guide-to-slaying-vampires/</guid><description>&lt;p>If I had a nickel for every book I&amp;rsquo;d read recently where I went into it not really knowing much more than the cover and title and suddenly &lt;em>horror novel&lt;/em>, I&amp;rsquo;d have two nickels. Which isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot, but it&amp;rsquo;s weird that it happened twice.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Fried Green Tomatoes&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Steel Magnolias&lt;/em> meet &lt;em>Dracula&lt;/em> in this Southern-flavored supernatural thriller set in the &amp;rsquo;90s about a women&amp;rsquo;s book club that must protect its suburban community from a mysterious and handsome stranger who turns out to be a blood-sucking fiend.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Which probably should have clued me in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating story that starts out fairly tame. A southern woman settled into a life of housewife&amp;ndash;a life of long days, unthanked by her family.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Why do you pretend what we do is nothing?” she asked. “Every day, all the chaos and messiness of life happens and every day we clean it all up. Without us, they would just wallow in filth and disorder and nothing of any consequence would ever get done. Who taught you to sneer at that? I’ll tell you who. Someone who took their mother for granted.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And to brighten her days&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sometimes she craved a little danger. And that was why she had book club.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That is, until a strange man moves in next door. With a mysterious aversion to sunlight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Uh huh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At some point, the book really gets into that &amp;lsquo;runaway freight train&amp;rsquo; feeling. There are some serious body horror scenes in this book and it gets increasingly dark. I mean, it started with biting an ear off, but it goes quite a bit further than that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yeah, definitely a horror novel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I enjoyed it. The American South housewife theme isn&amp;rsquo;t something I read overly much and it it&amp;rsquo;s interesting counterpoint to the vampiric horror. They&amp;rsquo;re both great examples of &amp;lsquo;pretty and polite on the surface&amp;ndash;and absolutely &lt;em>not&lt;/em> underneath&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read, I&amp;rsquo;d say.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Foxglove Summer</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/09/foxglove-summer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/09/foxglove-summer/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We trooped off behind her into waist high bracken, down something that was not so much a path as a statistical variation in the density of the undergrowth.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Tne one where Peter goes to the country.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I wondered just when I’d become “the starling” and why everyone who was anyone in the supernatural community had such a problem with proper nouns.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And he&amp;rsquo;s so out of his element.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two children missing and it just so happens that one of Nightingale&amp;rsquo;s former colleagues is in the area. So of course Peter has to go check in on him&amp;hellip; and gets entirely too involved in what does (of course) end up being something in the Folly&amp;rsquo;s department.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“What the hell is that?” he asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“It’s a magic spell,” I said, and Beverley snorted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Show off,” she said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I said I was going to do magic,” I said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“But . . .” Dominic floundered around for a bit before pointing at me accusingly. “You said that there’s weird shit, but it normally turns out to have a rational explanation.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“It does,” said Beverley. “The explanation is a wizard did it.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“That’s my line,” I said.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I do like the &amp;lsquo;half in the open&amp;rsquo; stance that this series takes to magic. Most people don&amp;rsquo;t know or care that magic is real, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that Peter can&amp;rsquo;t occasionally show off and actually use his tools for what they are&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There’s nothing quite like Latin for disguising the fact that you’re making it up as you go along.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Such as they are.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, I really do like seeing Beverly again. She totally has a point that Peter basically ignored her for a book&amp;hellip; well, not this time around. And there are going to be reprecussions of that, just you wait.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But not for the moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we do get is a mystery wrapped up in even more slowly extending worldbuilding. Now we know a bit more about the Rivers and more than the very little we knew about the Fae. And of all the things&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>Didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/charles-stross/">Charles Stross&lt;/a> go a similar route in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/05/equoid/">Equoid&lt;/a> (spoilers)? There&amp;rsquo;s about a year between the two.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I enjoyed the story, it was a neat way to expand the setting. The ending was &amp;hellip; weak. It felt like things just suddenly wrapped up right when they were getting interesting, which is a bit annoying.

Created by the Michael Schur (who also did the Good Place, check it out!) and with many overlapping cast members from the Good Place, I had high hopes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I learned that it was about a man learning to live in an assisted living center, I &amp;hellip; wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure. Was there a supernatural element?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then when it dropped (in the first episode and all the promotional materials, so I don&amp;rsquo;t see it as a spoiler) that he&amp;rsquo;s going in to assisted living as a SPY! Well, I&amp;rsquo;m intriuged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun show, hilarious at times (especially with just how &lt;em>bad&lt;/em> Charles is at all this) and sad at others (it&amp;rsquo;s about old folks. Death, loneliness, and memory loss are just part of it). But it&amp;rsquo;s quite the ride all the way through.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do love the cast, Ted Danson as Charles is amazing. I enjoyed Mary Elizabeth Ellis
as his daughter Emily, even if her family troubles were a weird B plot. Lilah Richcreek Estrada as Julie did &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to solve this problem whatever it takes&amp;rsquo; wonderfully, and it was fascinating to see Stephanie Beatriz as head of staff Didi. I really need to watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine at some point&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then all of the old folks inhabiting those halls&amp;hellip; Man those were some performances. I honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t recognize any of them from other roles but I expect there are some well known names in there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful show and goes by quick. Well worth the watch!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exposure</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/05/exposure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/05/exposure/</guid><description>&lt;p>Of course I had to read the sequel!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s another story of Rita Todacheene, but this time getting into the absolute &lt;em>trauma&lt;/em> of the first book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s hard enough (I imagine) being a crime scene photography. Constantly exposed to all that fairly grisly death. But add to that ghosts only you can see screaming at you about solving their murders, but when few enough of your coworkers and bosses believe you&amp;ndash;to the point of thinking you&amp;rsquo;ve lost your mind?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So Rita is done. Heading back home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except this time&amp;hellip; the ghosts are coming with her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time, rather than backstory the second plot being Rita&amp;rsquo;s past, we have another point of view&amp;ndash;who we quicly learn is a serial killer caught up in his own paranoid worldview and bringing it violently to those around him. It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating contrast to the first book and I really liked it. It reminded me a lot of various thrillers I read years and years ago, mostly by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/dean-koontz/">Dean Koontz&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a solid sequel and I so wish the best and better for Rita. Oh I&amp;rsquo;m curious to see if there will be another! Where do you go from here?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shutter</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/02/shutter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/02/shutter/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Grandma always said to me that you never do things for people to get something in return. That is the white man’s way of living. You do it because they need you. You do it because if you don’t, no one else will.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s quite a book!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a word, it&amp;rsquo;s an urban fantasy about a Diné (Navajo) forensic photographer that can see ghosts. But it&amp;rsquo;s so much more than that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I love the main character: Rita Todacheene. Someone that can see ghosts and a cop (or cop adjacent) is something I&amp;rsquo;ve seen before, but it being a forensic photographer gave a particular poignancy to the whole thing. And the Diné angle was fascinating&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a bit of it in other urban fantasy books, but they have a particular way of looking at death which really plays interestingly against someone that can see ghosts!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a bit of setting, the attention to detail on the cameras and the craft of photography was a really interesting touch. Rita, growing up poor but from a whole line of photographers. You really get the feeling she knows and loves everything about it which really gives a certain feel to the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Content warning though: We do get a number of descriptions of what exactly she&amp;rsquo;s photographing. And some of those are &lt;em>grisly&lt;/em>. At least we don&amp;rsquo;t get the pictures? (I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know for sure, I listened to this on audiobook&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Structurally, the book alternates between the present day&amp;ndash;Rita trying to solve crimes and stay mostly sane with ghosts hounding here&amp;ndash;and the past: Rita&amp;rsquo;s time growing up with her grandmother on a reservation, first coming to terms with life, death, and all it means to her specifically. It&amp;rsquo;s a really nice contrast, pulling the two stories together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s not the most complicated of mysteries. You mostly have enough clues to figure out where this is going, but oh the ride to get there. It&amp;rsquo;s still well worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I learned early that no amount of prayer or smoke or love was ever going to change the fact that these lights wanted to talk to me. Even at three years old, I knew it was something that deeply terrified my grandma and our medicine man. It was something that I was going to have to hide from them. As I got older, I taught myself how to look beyond the ghosts and mute their voices.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When a government ceases to protect its people, it becomes necessary to overthrow it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s how you end a trilogy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Revolution on revolution, coup on coup. Love and hate, betrayal and double/triple/who even knows crossing. And death. Oh the deaths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we get a conclusion (for now) of the revolution we were first introduced to in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/30/fireborne/">Fireborne&lt;/a>. And the government in exile of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/12/flamefall/">Flamefall&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The characters are still a large driving factor here, especially (but not only!) Annie and Lee. We finally get an answer to the whole &amp;lsquo;will they / won&amp;rsquo;t they&amp;rsquo; which I expect we all saw coming, but it&amp;rsquo;s all in &lt;em>how&lt;/em> it happened&amp;hellip; and what came next. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of sweet here&amp;ndash;and more than a helpful of bittersweet as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that Griff is a fascinating point here. He got everything he wanted in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/12/flamefall/">Flamefall&lt;/a> and a few things that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t bear. So for half the book, he&amp;rsquo;s the hero&amp;ndash;and drowning himself in his sorrows. But add in Delo as an actual point of view this time around? A plot well worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the antagonists side, we have Ixion. Oh we love to hate them. Being the last book, they have to fall, but it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a long painful trip to get there. The (re)introduction of the Bassileans, their princess, and their gargantuan dragon. I think that&amp;rsquo;s a sort of difference in dragon breeds and hints at a larger world that I could do with more of. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to realize that for all the chaos we&amp;rsquo;ve been through with these books, they&amp;rsquo;re only a tiny part of the larger world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then there&amp;rsquo;s Power. He is very much the most complicated character in these books, thoroughly in the morally gray category. Oh Power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I loved these books. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to see what else &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/rosaria-munda/">Rosaria Munda&lt;/a> has done! Onward!&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s Toy Story nearly a century before Toy Story (I wonder just how old &amp;rsquo;toys come alive&amp;rsquo; stories are?), with a doll and her friends waking up and getting into all sorts of delightfully weird and cute trouble.

&lt;p>Books are not fish sticks.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now, we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em>really&lt;/em> in the Free Kingdoms. We spent a book learning that there&amp;rsquo;s a hidden world and another mostly underground (in the Library of Alexandria!), so it&amp;rsquo;s nice to get something really &amp;lsquo;hidden world&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And man, the Free Kingdoms are strange. But that&amp;rsquo;s probably just the Librarian brainwashing coming through. Castles. Glass pigs. More castles. Kings. Councils. And even more Smedrys!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Farting barf-faced poop!” a voice exclaimed from inside the pig’s butt.&lt;br>
(Sigh. Sorry. At least that’s another great paragraph to try working into a random conversation.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Exactly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the hilarious (from our point of view) issues that comes up this book is Alcatraz coming to his &amp;lsquo;Harry Potter&amp;rsquo; moment. A world where he knows next to nothing, but everyone knows who he is. Apparently via the in-universe Alcatraz books, which is an extra level of weirdly meta.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Fame is like a cheeseburger. It might not be the best or most healthy thing to have, but it will still fill you up. You don’t really care how healthy something is when you’ve been without for so long. Like a cheeseburger, fame fills a need, and it tastes so good going down. It isn’t until years later that you realize what it has done to your heart.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There are just so many book/other geeky media references. I love them.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>For example, take this story: “Once there was a furry-footed British guy who had to go throw his uncle’s ring into a hole in the ground.” Sounds dumb, doesn’t it?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Nothing is sacred!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“That’s bad,” Folsom said.&lt;br>
“She Who Cannot Be Named?” I asked. “Why can’t we say her name? Because it might draw the attention of evil powers? Because we’re afraid of her? Because her name has become a curse upon the world?”&lt;br>
“Don’t be silly,” Himalaya said. “We don’t say her name because nobody can pronounce it.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Exactly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s more Alcatraz. You have a fun plot, wacky characters, and &lt;em>just&lt;/em> on the edge of too much meta commentary on writing/being a work of &amp;lsquo;fiction&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m still quite enjoying it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And this is only halfway.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s a police mantra that all members of the public are guilty of something, but some members of the public are more guilty than others.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The more things change&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, we have both Peter and Leslie as apprentices at the Folly, learning how to do magic things&amp;ndash;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I’d love to stick some high vestigia material into a mass spectrometer, but first I’d have to get myself a mass spectrometer and then I’d have to learn enough physics to interpret the bloody results.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ndash;and use those abilities to investigate those &lt;em>stranger&lt;/em> cases in London.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The key is unlikely juxtapositions. Lots of people read books about the occult, but if you find them alongside books by or about Isaac Newton, especially the long boring ones, then hackles are raised, flags hoisted and, more importantly, notes made in my notebook.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;the more they remain the same&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then they find a body sans face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Attend a peace summit between Rivers/Fae. (I actually really do enjoy how fuzzy and ill defined Fae apparently are in this world. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting and feels somehow more &amp;lsquo;Fae&amp;rsquo; than you often see.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Move into an estate (British for project housing).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Peter,” she said. “When you threaten people it’s usually more effective if they don’t have to spend five minutes working out what you just said first.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a strange book.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;until quite suddenly things &lt;em>aren&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> the same anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oof.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a brutal ending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave it at that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And immediately go start the next book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doctor Who: Season 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/25/doctor-who-season-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/25/doctor-who-season-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m still re-watching Doctor Who in fits and starts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, after all that was great with Eccleston/Nine in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/02/doctor-who-season-1/">season 1&lt;/a>, how we get Tennant/Ten. Oh, I do enjoy his take on the doctor. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect mix of a whimsical seeing what he can get away with&amp;ndash;with the absolute feel of sadness and age that a being like the Doctor really should be feeling&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And all with Rose along for the ride. Rose gets a lot of hate at times, but I really think she was a pretty good first nu-Who companion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this season, we a fair few two parters, a bunch of great episodes. &lt;a href="#4-the-girl-in-the-fireplace">The Girl in the Fireplace&lt;/a> is a great take on &amp;rsquo;the Time Travelers wife&amp;rsquo; sort of thing. &lt;a href="#5-rise-of-the-cybermen">Rise of the Cybermen&lt;/a>/&lt;a href="#6-age-of-steel">Age of Steel&lt;/a> introduces us to some old foes. &lt;a href="#8-the-impossible-planet">The Impossible Planet&lt;/a>/&lt;a href="#9-satan-pit">Satan Pit&lt;/a> &lt;em>really&lt;/em> start getting into Doctor Who as sci-fi/horror (and I love it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="#10-love--monsters">Love &amp;amp; Monsters&lt;/a>. That&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; actually not that bad? It&amp;rsquo;s definitely one of the &amp;lsquo;Doctor-lite&amp;rsquo; episodes, which are always something interesting to try. The ending is crass and kind of terrifying to really think about&amp;ndash;rather than the laughs you might think they were going for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a solid season!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And &lt;a href="#special-the-runaway-bride">the special&lt;/a> introduces Donna! Even if she won&amp;rsquo;t be back for a bit, she&amp;rsquo;s certainly a contender for my favorite companion.&lt;/p>

I absolutely loved [[Arcane: Season 1]]. I still loved Season 2&amp;hellip; but I think they may have reached just a &lt;em>bit&lt;/em> too far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The art style is still amazing. We still have the same main steampunk/magitech/brightly colored visuals (Jink&amp;rsquo;s chaotic spraypunk style in particular), but there are also more scenes this time, with different styles matching the feel. Chaotic black slashes when a monster hunts, childhood crayon feeling drawings for memories, and SPACE for&amp;hellip; well, spoilers. And oh, the glitching. Weird, but quite the style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The characters&amp;hellip; I think at it&amp;rsquo;s heart, this show is about Vi and Jinx and man do they go through a lot in this season. I already felt for Jinx&amp;ndash;even if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure she could ever be redeemed in season 1&amp;ndash;and they just turn it up. On top of that, you have Jayce/Viktor, which&amp;hellip; man that one hurt this season. Plus Vi/Cait (go them!), and Mel/her mother (this one didn&amp;rsquo;t get nearly as much time as it needed), and Ekko (this could have been a whole season&amp;hellip; or left out entirely).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mostly, I think this was the biggest problem with this season. It&amp;rsquo;s only 9 episodes, mostly short of 45 minutes. That is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> enough time to fit everything that they tried to put in this show. I could have easily watched an entire season focussing on any one of those plots above&amp;hellip; and they tried to fit it all in. We get some resolutions&amp;hellip; but so much is left undone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently there won&amp;rsquo;t be an Arcane Season 3; instead, we&amp;rsquo;ll get one or more spinoff shows in the same universe but with other stories/settings/characters. This is absolutely for the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of feel, the first season did a good job of feeling real/grounded. It was a story of class warfare and the introduction of magic into a steampunk world. It all &amp;lsquo;fit&amp;rsquo;. Here, we get quite a bit more of the more &amp;lsquo;cosmic&amp;rsquo; side of what&amp;rsquo;s apparently also kicking around in this world. I liked it, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, but it felt so much bigger and weirder than the first season that they didn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit together&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall? I still quite enjoyed Season 2. It is absolutely worth watching Season 1 and once you have&amp;hellip; well, you have to go on, right? I&amp;rsquo;ll totally check out any spin-offs that we get.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Taskmaster: Series 18</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/20/taskmaster-series-18/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/20/taskmaster-series-18/</guid><description>&lt;p>I &amp;hellip; managed to miss [[todo:Taskmaster: Series 17]] somehow. Anyways!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another delightful season. This was a fun cast. Baba was full of chaos, Rosie got away with so much crap (sometimes literally) and her team tasks with Jack were such chaos. Andy has serious mad professor vibes (mostly the hair I suppose). Emma&amp;hellip; Emma was my favorite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rosie having cerebral palsy certainly started out with a different flavor to the season. But man she has a sense of humor about the whole thing. I think it took Greg and the other contestants a minute to feel out how far to go (&amp;ldquo;Is it too early in the series to mention I DON&amp;rsquo;T have cerebral palsy?&amp;rdquo; - Emma)&amp;hellip; but once they did, that was a lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>As you can tell by the way I talk, I suffer from being Northern. &amp;ndash; Rosie&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Revenge doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to begin with a knife. It can begin with a well-delivered speech.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The cracks were already showing in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/30/fireborne/">Fireborne&lt;/a>. There may have been a Revolution, dealing away with the Dragonlords of old&amp;hellip; but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that whatever comes next is going to be any better. So much so that you start to see those with the feeling that &amp;lsquo;maybe things weren&amp;rsquo;t so bad under the Dragonlords after all&amp;rsquo;. And it just so happens that there&amp;rsquo;s more than one cousin in exile&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really enjoy seeing Annie come into her own in this book, taking her place in charge of the dragon riders after Lee stepped down. And then dealing with all that comes from having to make all those hard decisions at the top. Dealing with Lee and the government and the other riders and her own past. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Lee, actually coming out into the open&amp;ndash;while dealing with the trauma at the end of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/30/fireborne/">Fireborne&lt;/a>. Complicated that. I kept expecting him to snap&amp;ndash;and hoping that he won&amp;rsquo;t, that he &lt;em>will actually be better&lt;/em>. I&amp;rsquo;m rooting for you!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then we have newcomer Griff. Another peasant dragon rider from a &lt;em>very&lt;/em> different set of circumstances. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to introduce a new main character in the second book, but I really do think it was done well. Man, the New Pythians are &lt;em>twisted&lt;/em>, almost comically evil. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make them any less dangerous to those in teh story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oy there&amp;rsquo;s just so much in this book.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Tonight I&amp;rsquo;m full of confidence, like a dragon riding a gale. I am done letting these tendrils of shame tie me to the ground. No shadow is so great that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t shrink when viewed from the air.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how it ends from here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oppenheimer</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/12/oppenheimer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/12/oppenheimer/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/11/barbie/">Barbenheimer&lt;/a>!&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Oppenheimer: Albert? When I came to you with those calculations, we thought we might start a chain reaction that would destroy the entire world&amp;hellip;&lt;br>
Einstein: I remember it well. What of it?&lt;br>
Oppenheimer: I believe we did.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That is a long, dense film.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s complicated and there are &lt;em>long&lt;/em> stretches with little going on by talking and setting. But&amp;hellip; man, is it thematic talking and setting?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s all about the story of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%20Robert%20Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer&lt;/a>, the so called &amp;lsquo;father of the atomic bomb&amp;rsquo; and&amp;hellip; well, how he earned that title. I knew bits and pieces of the story, but having watched this, bits and pieces were apparently all I knew. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of amazing how many of the names I recognize from physics classes were involved in either the project or Oppenheimer&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was at times difficult to follow, there are a ton of jumps (mostly stylistically) and it makes me wander just how much of that was actually problems in Oppenheimer&amp;rsquo;s mind and how much was style. That&amp;rsquo;s not really clear, even by the end of the movie. I certainly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised though if he was having issues like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Einstein: When they&amp;rsquo;ve punished you enough, they&amp;rsquo;ll serve you salmon and potato salad, make speeches, give you a medal, and pat you in the back telling all is forgiven. Just remember, it won&amp;rsquo;t be for you&amp;hellip; it would be for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I think the cast was another impressive part of this film. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t speak to just how perfectly accurate it was, but I think Cillian Murphy was an excellent casting for Oppenheimer. He&amp;rsquo;s got just the right amount of strange charisma to really pull you into the film.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr. were solid roles, enough to actually remind me why they&amp;rsquo;re considered solid actors&amp;ndash;and not just playing themselves as some do. Alden Ehrenreich I thought looked familiar, but had to look up where I&amp;rsquo;d seen him recently (Solo and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/02/17/beautiful-creatures/">Beautiful Creatures&lt;/a> (that&amp;rsquo;s been a while)). There are just a bunch of people I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in other things before&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, quite the solid movie. I think I learned something and enjoyed the process of doing something, which is something always worth saying. It&amp;rsquo;s long, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth a watch!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Personally, I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s any reason to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/11/barbie/">Barbenheimer&lt;/a> it though, although it is amusing.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last note:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Oppenheimer: Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The first time he says it&amp;hellip; was surprising and kind of weird. I expect they were going with &amp;rsquo;everyone is waiting for him to say the line&amp;hellip; psyche!&amp;rsquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave it at that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Barbie</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/11/barbie/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/11/barbie/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/12/oppenheimer/">Barbenheimer&lt;/a>!&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Barbie is quite a movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An entire world populated entirely by every single variant of Barbie and Ken&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. All named Barbie and Ken, all living their lives in the most &amp;lsquo;we&amp;rsquo;re sort of toys and sort of real&amp;rsquo; way possible. Drinking your morning coffee? Tip the empty cup to your mouth. Need to get out of the second floor? Just jump down! And of course&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ken: I thought I might stay over tonight.&lt;br>
Barbie: Why?&lt;br>
Ken: Because we&amp;rsquo;re girfriend and boyfriend.&lt;br>
Barbie: To do what?&lt;br>
[pause]&lt;br>
Ken: I&amp;rsquo;m actually not sure.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh this movie is weirdly(ly on point) at times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we get the &amp;rsquo;toy in the real world and DOESN&amp;rsquo;T UNDERSTAND THINGS&amp;rsquo; scenes. I feel like a lot of those were dialed up &lt;em>just&lt;/em> to the edge of over-parody, but really, it somehow just works? Barbie is so out of sorts and just doesn&amp;rsquo;t realize it&amp;hellip; until she does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things go wrong&amp;hellip; and suddenly the movie isn&amp;rsquo;t just the Barbie movie anymore. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s all about Ken. And the PATRIARCHY.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ken: To be honest, when I found out the patriarchy wasn&amp;rsquo;t just about horses, I lost interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I knew that we were going to have some major conflict there, in a world (almost) entirely populated by Barbies and Kens&amp;hellip; who else is there? But it&amp;rsquo;s kind of weird. I feel like Ken honestly has more of a story arc for a lot of the movie does than Barbie. Which&amp;hellip; feels kind of against the entire point of the movie?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It works though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course, we have the big Mattel in the room. Of &lt;em>course&lt;/em> we have to have a dig about companies making toys for girls run by powerful men. But man, did they dial that one up to 11 on a rediculous scale. A bicycle built for&amp;hellip; a boardroom. That is all. Will Ferrell is a delight as the CEO. After Lord Business in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/02/15/the-lego-movie/">The Lego Movie&lt;/a>&amp;hellip; this is a weird role to be typecast as, but it really works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of casting, I did love Margot Robbie as Barbie&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Barbie: [in tears] I&amp;rsquo;m not pretty anymore!&lt;br>
Gloria: What? You&amp;rsquo;re so pretty!&lt;br>
Barbie: I&amp;rsquo;m not stereotypical Barbie pretty!&lt;br>
Narrator: Note to the filmmakers: Margot Robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>She just &amp;hellip; epitomizes Barbieness in the movie? I don&amp;rsquo;t know who esle could possibly have carried that role quite as well. Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie was great as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Ryan Gosling as Ken&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. This one I think could have been differently cast with less issue, but he still did a wonderful job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing that stood out was how at times uncomfortably on point Barbie managed to be on various social commentary issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sasha: You&amp;rsquo;re a fascist!&lt;br>
Barbie: How can I be a fascist?&lt;br>
[through tears]&lt;br>
Barbie: I don&amp;rsquo;t control the railways or the flow of commerce&amp;hellip;&lt;br>
[cries]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh this movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it was a movie better than it had any right to be and far better than I expected, even with generally positive reviews going on. Worth watching. Not sure it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/12/oppenheimer/">Barbenheimer&lt;/a> it though&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Toasting Marshmallows: Camping Poems</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/10/toasting-marshmallows-camping-poems/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/10/toasting-marshmallows-camping-poems/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of those &amp;lsquo;read to the children over a few evenings, so I should count it&amp;rsquo; sort of books.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s one of those stories you expect to know what happens even before you read it. Frankenstein&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> creates LIFE in a form stitched together from dead bodies. But it&amp;rsquo;s super ugly, so he drives his creation off. Said creation isn&amp;rsquo;t a huge fan of this and goes on a murderous rampage. The end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yet, that&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em>entirely&lt;/em> right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an oddly formatted story to a much more modern reader. It&amp;rsquo;s epistolary (told in letters and journals), which reminds me a lot of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/29/dracula/">Dracula&lt;/a> and nested. We have letters from a sea captain, the account of Victor Frankenstein, and then finally &lt;span class="spoiler">the monster himself&lt;/span>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat style, but I think a bit more could have been done with it. And it&amp;rsquo;s never really a great sign when one of the main viewpoints (Frankenstein himself) is just hard to read. He&amp;rsquo;s not likeable and depressed a lot of the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions, seems still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; yet, when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Which again, I get it. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make for a thrilling read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s billed as one of the earlier examples of science fiction, but it&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em>really&lt;/em> science fiction. It does deal with the idea of bringing life&amp;ndash;but never really gets into it. It&amp;rsquo;s setting as much as anything, something to set the story in motion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alternatively, it&amp;rsquo;s also called early modern Horror, but &amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s not really horror in either the jump scare or thriller or cosmic senses of the word. There&amp;rsquo;s some sense of inevitability&amp;ndash;the creation is coming!&amp;ndash;but it never really amounts to much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth having read mostly in a completionist sense. And really, I&amp;rsquo;m glad I listened to this one on audiobook&amp;ndash;they have a way of just keeping you going when you might otherwise get stuck and put the book down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2024 Year in Reviews</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/31/2024-year-in-reviews/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 23:59:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/31/2024-year-in-reviews/</guid><description>&lt;p>11 years. 1300 book reviews. 170 movies. 100 seasons of TV shows.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Luck is a fairy tale we use to make people feel better about the world being unfair as shit.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Man this book has come a ways since &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/07/05/the-city-of-brass/">The City of Brass&lt;/a>. At first we had a fairly straight forward portal fantasy: normal human girl goes through a portal (ish) to another world, discovers magic, and has adventures (again; ish). Then things escalate. Political intrigue. Old enemies. Revolution. War.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now&amp;hellip; Daevabad has fallen. Nahri and Ali are on the run, trying desperately first to survive and then&amp;hellip; maybe, to come back and save the day. And perhaps learn all those dirty little secrets those (formerly) in power tried hard to hide all these years.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I do not believe ambitious men who say the only route to peace and prosperity lies in giving them more power—particularly when they do it with lands and people who are not theirs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I love the characters. Especially Dara, but the whole Nahri and Ali journey was great to read. And I even foundmyself rooting for Muntadhir, which after the previous books&amp;hellip; I did not expect). Manizheh&amp;hellip; I think Ghassan was a better villain overall, and it&amp;rsquo;s interesting that she made it as far as she did, but so it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I still love the worldbuilding&amp;ndash;even if I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em>still after 3 books&lt;/em> not 100% sure what is a subset of what and who is a when. But I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s the point. Reality is messy. But it&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating world and I&amp;rsquo;m sad to be leaving it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall it&amp;rsquo;s a solid conclusion to a great series. I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to read more in this world, but I&amp;rsquo;m always glad to see a series actually get it&amp;rsquo;s own small end, rather than just fading out as many do.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Find your happiness, little thief. Steal it and do not ever let it go.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Iron Council</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/30/iron-council/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/30/iron-council/</guid><description>&lt;p>[[Perdido Street Station|One in a city]], [[The Scar|one on a boat]]&amp;hellip; and now one based around an entire civilization built around a &amp;lsquo;perpetual train&amp;rsquo;, putting down rails as it goes (and at times, tearing them up behind it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/china-mi%C3%A9ville/">China Miéville&lt;/a> has some bonkers worldbuilding ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I mean course you want a change, we want a change, but if a change ain’t godsdamn coming, then the next thing I wish is that I didn’t care.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Beyond that, we have a whole book about political oppression and xenophobia (the Iron Council is initially founded by the remade working on the train). It&amp;rsquo;s about the tension of a revolution that feels inevitable. We have a story about gender differences (in a world where sexual dimorphism is a huge deal for some species) and love and longing. And a story about future history. The messy way of how one ends up getting history books written about them.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“History&amp;hellip;” Jacobs spoke with terse authority. Brought Ori to a hush. “Is all full. And dripping. With the corpses. Of them who trusted the incorruptible.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also interesting to see the fallout of the &amp;lsquo;Contruct Uprising&amp;rsquo;. A direct consequence of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/04/perdido-street-station/">Perdido Street Station&lt;/a>. And now instead, we have &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golems">golems&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;which in this world can be made by animating any sorts of bits of innanimate matter and giving them life/instructions. It&amp;rsquo;s cool!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, I think this may be the weakest of the three. Despite how cool an idea a &amp;lsquo;perpetual train&amp;rsquo; is, I think the story spends too much time on other people/places/things. It&amp;rsquo;s all building up, but when one of the things I love the most (and always start by describing) is left wanting? That&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a bummer. It&amp;rsquo;s still fascinating and there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of it&amp;hellip; but I wanted more!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Whispers Under Ground</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/29/whispers-under-ground/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/29/whispers-under-ground/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ghosts! Goblins! Murder! The FBI (in London)! The LONDON UNDERGROUND!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do continue to really love the feel of these books. It &lt;em>feels&lt;/em> like a British cop show with a combination of magical elements and the science of magic, which are all delightful things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly the same, although this time around, we get a lot more of Lesley stepping up to learn magic again, which is something I was hoping would happen. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how those two grow together.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That was Seawoll,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Stephanopoulos is on her way down and you’re not to do anything stupid until she gets here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You burn down one central London tourist attraction, I thought, and they never let you forget it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also interesting seeing the bits of London as a city built on people from all manners, histories, and walks of life.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My mum translated this in her head to &amp;ldquo;witchfinder,&amp;rdquo; which was good because like most West Africans, she considered witchfinding a more respectable profession than policeman.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worldbuildingwise, I like seeing ever more of teh magical world of London. There really is a feel of &amp;rsquo;this &lt;em>could&lt;/em> be&amp;rsquo; that urban fantasy doesn&amp;rsquo;t always get right. And I enjoy finding out that even the magical folks don&amp;rsquo;t know how a lot of what they do works, but our main character is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> going to let that stand.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is why magic is worse even than quantum physics. Because, while both spit in the eye of common sense, I&amp;rsquo;ve never yet had a Higgs bosun turn up and try to have a conversation with me.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s fun to see even more of the magical underground (literally). It&amp;rsquo;s neat to see how different authors play with old stories (and make up their own!)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“My dad was a fairy,&amp;quot; said Zach. &amp;ldquo;And by that I don&amp;rsquo;t mean he dressed well and enjoyed musical theatre.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>One oddity: There are a ton of Lord of the Rings references throughout this book, some blatent and some more subtle. I was really fully expecting that to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s%20gun">Chekhov&amp;#39;s gun&lt;/a>&amp;hellip; but they were just references all along? That seems weird to me and I can&amp;rsquo;t quite my finger on why.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I loved it and am looking forward to the next one! Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alcatraz Versus the Scrivener's Bones</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/20/alcatraz-versus-the-scriveners-bones/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/20/alcatraz-versus-the-scriveners-bones/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Once there was a bunny. This bunny had a birthday party. It was the bestest birthday party ever. Because that was the day the bunny got a bazooka.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bunny loved his bazooka. He blew up all sorts of things on the farm. He blew up the stable of Henrietta the Horse. He blew up the pen of Pugsly the Pig. He blew up the coop of Chuck the Chicken.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I have the bestest bazooka ever,&amp;rdquo; the bunny said. Then the farm friends proceeded to beat him senseless and steal his bazooka. It was the happiest day of his life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Epilogue: Pugsly the Pig, now without a pen, was quite annoyed. When none of the others were looking, he stole the bazooka. He tied a bandana on his head and swore vengeance for what had been done to him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;From this day on,&amp;rdquo; he whispered, raising the bazooka, &amp;ldquo;I shall be known as Hambo.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>(Hushlanders, it might be noted, aren’t very imaginative with their idioms. Personally, I say, “Out of the frying pan and into the deadly pit filled with sharks who are wielding chainsaws with killer kittens stapled to them.” However, that one’s having a rough time catching on.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Essentially, the entire book is an adventure where Alcatraz and co (Bastille, but also newcomers Australia&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and Kaz) are on a mission to mention a recently missing Grandpa Smedry.

&lt;p>Ready Player One is a very pretty movie (I seem to be saying that [a lot]) recently) and absolutely chock full of pop culture references&amp;hellip; which honestly felt rather overdone.

For episodes at a time, we may not see elves. Or dwarves. Or Gandalf-but-still-not-Gandalf. I keep getting to the start of an episode and thinking &amp;lsquo;oh hey, we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen them in a while&amp;rsquo;. But the interesting thing is that I got to the end of the episodes!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s what we saw in the first season, but even more so. There are so many different threads and events&amp;ndash;things separated by decades if not centuries in the original works all crammed together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But on the other hand, we get more rings! (Up from zero 😄) We get bigger battles! (Not quite Helm&amp;rsquo;s Deep, but close) More Tom Bombadil! (You&amp;rsquo;ll just have to watch to see if you think I&amp;rsquo;m making that one up) And we get more &amp;hellip; humanized orcs with families and children? I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;hellip; not entirely sure what to think about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall&amp;hellip; it mostly reminds me just &lt;em>good&lt;/em> the Peter Jackson movies were. But it&amp;rsquo;s certainly watchable and I&amp;rsquo;ll catch whatever season(s) come next. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alita: Battle Angel</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/13/alita-battle-angel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/13/alita-battle-angel/</guid><description>&lt;p>That is a very pretty movie. The city had a great aesthetic. I loved the variety of cyborgs, many just trying to live their lives (in the background) or&amp;hellip; becoming ridiculously overdone weapons platforms. And I especially loved Motorball!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, Rosa Salazar as Alita really carried the show. I actually really enjoyed the oversized eyes (true to the manga apparently?) and her whole way of interacting with the world, the way she fights, the way she &lt;em>moves&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating combination of innocence and excellence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than that&amp;hellip; I wanted to like Christoph Walz&amp;rsquo;s Dr. Ido more than I did&amp;ndash;he&amp;rsquo;s generally a wonderful actor, but I feel he just didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to do. Likwise, Jennifer Connelly&amp;rsquo;s Chiren. I did enjoy Mahershala Alis&amp;rsquo; Vector and most of the evil cyborgs. They did a good job of evil/menacing!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise? Straight forward. And the ending&amp;hellip; really is asking for a sequel that so far as I know isn&amp;rsquo;t coming. It&amp;rsquo;d be neat! But you can&amp;rsquo;t just end a movie like that! Really leaves a poor taste on an otherwise quiet enjoyable movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/02/deadpool-wolverine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/02/deadpool-wolverine/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so here it is, (almost) the entire reason I rewatched &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/26/deadpool/">Deadpool&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/28/deadpool-2/">Deadpool 2&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much exactly what you get if you took the (crass) humor of Deadpool, jammed in as many cameos as you could, and shoved it into the modern &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/marvel-cinematic-universe/">MCU&lt;/a>, multiverse, TVA, and all&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Deadpool: Welcome to the MCU. You&amp;rsquo;re joining at a bit of a low point.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m still not &lt;em>actually&lt;/em> sure if that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wonderland</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/02/wonderland/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/02/wonderland/</guid><description>&lt;p>I actually picked up this book the day I voted in the election. A three hour line at the local library where you&amp;rsquo;ve run out of podcasts will do that to you. 😄 Mostly, the cover looked neat, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give it a chance. Which makes this only the second physical (non-children&amp;rsquo;s) book I&amp;rsquo;ve read in probably a decade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For better or (and) for worse, the book is billed as &amp;lsquo;if &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/shirley-jackson/">Shirley Jackson&lt;/a> wrote The Shining&amp;rsquo;, which&amp;hellip; this is not. It does have a family moved out deep into the wilderness, away from the city they&amp;rsquo;ve always loved, thrown into land where somehow you can get &amp;hellip; feet of unexpected snow? And a tree that may or may not be talking to you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mostly, I think it feels not quite finished. There are some decently creepy scenes in the book, but it never quite ramped up for me. The hallucinations the family goes through are certainly disconcerting but, barring one, they don&amp;rsquo;t really seem to be all that dangerous. I did like that it was never entirely clear what was hallucination and what was &lt;em>real&lt;/em> though, that was a nice touch. Then, by the time things really start falling apart, we have sudden violence/death that doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>really&lt;/em> land and an ending that wrapped up all too suddenly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will say that I did enjoy the descriptions of the mountain wilderness and their new home. I would have liked to explore that more. It felt &lt;em>wild&lt;/em>, which I appreciated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, being only the second physical book I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a &lt;em>long&lt;/em> while and a hardcover at that, it really did have a nice tactile feel to it and I was enjoying the book enough to read it all the way through, so I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly come across worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deadpool 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/28/deadpool-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/28/deadpool-2/</guid><description>language warning (duh?)
Well that certainly started with a bang.
After the surprsing (to some I suppose) success of Deadpool, of course they&amp;rsquo;re going to make another. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; pretty much exactly what you&amp;rsquo;d expect if you took Deadpool and turned it up to, well, as far as Cable&amp;rsquo;s gun goes. 😄

&lt;p>I really love seeing Grant exploring the magic of the world. He&amp;rsquo;s doing &lt;em>science&lt;/em> to &lt;strong>magic&lt;/strong>. I do enjoy books that do that. (Plus, it&amp;rsquo;s funny!)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I had jokingly developed my own scale for vestigia based on the amount of noise Toby made when he interacted with any residual magic. I called it a yap, one yap being enough vestigia to be apparent even when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The yap would be an SI unit, of course, and thus the standard background ambience of a Central London pub was 0.2 of a yap (0.2Y) or 200 milliyaps (200mY).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Also, more worldbuilding about what the &amp;lsquo;Rivers&amp;rsquo; are (fae? or at least fae adjacent). More talk about vampires. And of course&amp;hellip; What&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;em>deal&lt;/em> with Nightingale?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“What&amp;rsquo;s the biggest thing you&amp;rsquo;ve zapped with a fireball?&amp;rsquo; I asked.&lt;br>
&amp;lsquo;That would be a tiger,&amp;lsquo;said Nightingale.&lt;br>
&amp;lsquo;Well don&amp;rsquo;t tell Greenpeace,&amp;rsquo; I said. &amp;lsquo;They&amp;rsquo;re an endagered species.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br>
&amp;lsquo;Not that sort of tiger,&amp;rsquo; said Nightingale. &amp;lsquo;A Panzer-kampfwagen sechs Ausf E.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br>
I stared at him. &amp;lsquo;You knocked out a Tiger tank with a fireball?&amp;rsquo;&lt;br>
&amp;lsquo;Actually I knocked out two,&amp;rsquo; said Nightingale. &amp;lsquo;I have to admit that the first one took three shots, one to disable the tracks, one through the driver&amp;rsquo;s eye slot and one down the commander&amp;rsquo;s hatch - brewed up rather nicely.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Plus, we get piles more London, this time around digging into the musical/jazz scenes. I managed to go through the first book entirely expecting Grant&amp;rsquo;s parents to be out of the picture (that&amp;rsquo;s just the way urban fantasy always seems to go), so it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see them on page and actually playing interesting roles in the story!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My Dad says that being a Londoner has nothing to do with where you&amp;rsquo;re born. He says that there are people who get off a jumbo jet at Heathrow, go through immigration waving any kind of passport, hop on the tube and by the time the train&amp;rsquo;s pulled into Piccadilly Circus they&amp;rsquo;ve become a Londoner.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Weirdest change of this series: Grant falls quickly and &lt;em>deeply&lt;/em> in ~love~ lust with someone (from a case!) and there are a number of decently explicit on screen sex scenes. I didn&amp;rsquo;t necessary see that one coming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also plotwise, I was &amp;hellip; surprised by the ending. Not in who the big bad ended up being, more more what happened after that. It felt sudden and perhaps unearned, like we&amp;rsquo;d reached the end of the book and had to warp things up. I&amp;rsquo;m curious if we&amp;rsquo;ll get any fallout of that in future books, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really expect to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did really like the scenes with Leslie though (from the first book), especially&amp;ndash;and counter to my first point&amp;ndash;her ending. That&amp;hellip; now &lt;strong>that&lt;/strong> has some interesting potential for the series.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deadpool</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/26/deadpool/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/26/deadpool/</guid><description>language warning (duh?)

&lt;p>Scars are not injuries, Tanner Sack. A scar is a healing. After injury, a scar is what makes you whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Okay, I really thought that &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/04/perdido-street-station/">Perdido Street Station&lt;/a> was one of a kind. A dark, twisted magical world, full of strange creatures, stranger magic, and some truly weird and terrible things lurking just under the surface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, &lt;em>The Scar&lt;/em> manged to do quite the job proving me wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First off, we have the setting. In Perdido Street Station, the city of New Crobuzon itself was as much as a character in the stories as any of the, well, characters. So imagine my surprise where the city is only barely mentioned this time around: instead, we have Armada, a mighty floating city built on the back of untold years of captured (and otherwise) ships lashed all together.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Vessels knocked together for hour upon hour, like bones, like someone infinitely stupid and patient at the door of an empty house.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And deep under this city? Mile long chains, designed to harness&amp;hellip; &lt;em>something&lt;/em> to the city.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>So many truths have been kept from me. This violent, pointless voyage has been sopping with blood. I feel thick and sick with it. And that is all: contingent and brutal without meaning. There is nothing to be learnt here. No ecstatic forgetting. There is no redemption in the sea.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s not even getting into dead languages, weapsons and fighting styles that harness Possibility itself, a race of deadly mosquito people, and all the other terrors one might find on (and under) the ocean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then the characters. Bellis Coldwine, a linguist of all things (I love linguistics). An acquaintances of Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin&amp;rsquo;s (I love that name) on the run after the whole Slakemoth thing. Stuck on Armada, just looking for a way home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Silas Fennec. A traveler and so much more from New Crobuzon, with his fingers (and tongue (you&amp;rsquo;ll see)) in just about everything going on one way or another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tanner Sack. A Remade, fully adapted to life on&amp;ndash;and in&amp;ndash;the sea around Armada.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Uther Doul. A mysterious figure with truly &lt;em>weird&lt;/em> sword.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lovers. Rulers of Armada. Referred to in text as &amp;lsquo;The Lover&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;The Lover&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just love how strange and &lt;em>different&lt;/em> Miéville manages to write characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the deepest places, where physical norms collapse under the crushing water, bodies still fall softly through the dark, days after their vessels have capsized. They decay on their long journey down. Nothing will hit the black sand at the bottom of the world but algae-covered bones.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Overall, if anything I like &lt;em>The Scar&lt;/em> even &lt;strong>more&lt;/strong> than I did &lt;em>Perdido Street Station&lt;/em>. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what&amp;rsquo;s next!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Gwen, Vol. 2: Weapon of Choice</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/20/spider-gwen-vol.-2-weapon-of-choice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/20/spider-gwen-vol.-2-weapon-of-choice/</guid><description>&lt;p>And&amp;hellip; after &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/18/spider-women/">Spider-Women&lt;/a>, we&amp;rsquo;re back!&lt;/p>

Coming soon to an Earth-65 near you.
Also, that’s certainly an art style. It’s jarring in most crossovers but even more so in this one for some reason.
Anyways.
The idea of Jessica Drew’s alternate Agent Drew being a man is somewhat amusing, given her Ultimate version.
It’s fascinating to see someone so potentially character defining to Spider-Gwen—like losing her powers! —be in a crossover story.
I missed this as I was first planning&amp;hellip; Glad I went back and caught it, kind of important that one.</description></item><item><title>Spider-Gwen, Vol. 1: Greater Power</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/17/spider-gwen-vol.-1-greater-power/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/17/spider-gwen-vol.-1-greater-power/</guid><description>&lt;p>When worlds collide…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/spider-gwen-2015-v1-textbundle-eeebab.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this universe, Peter Parker wanted to be a hero and got killed for it. So… why is the Lizard apparently still running around?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, the Green Goblin!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much in this world built around a the severe ‘not what it looks like’ of Peter’s death. Strains incredulity… but that’s comics. And it (so far) is working for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The introduction of this world’s Captain America was fun. I appreciate the quick backstory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Likewise Harry Osborne. Dungeons and Dragons nerds unite!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m enjoying this series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Gwen, Vol. 0: Most Wanted?</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/16/spider-gwen-vol.-0-most-wanted/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/16/spider-gwen-vol.-0-most-wanted/</guid><description>&lt;p>It’s been a minute. Let’s read some Spider-Gwen. A Reddit post has a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpiderGwen/s/F0Ml2g31iH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reading order&lt;/a>. Man comics are complicated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here we have Spider-Gwen. An alternate Spider Gwen Stacy! Her dad’s a cop (hunting her) and life is complicated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have a small pile of villains—mostly a Vulture, but also Kingpin, Frank Castle, and Matt Murdoch. Ambiguous at both. I’m curious where it goes from here!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit of a chaotic start, but I’m looking forward to it!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
