&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not the best Urban Fantasy I&amp;rsquo;ve read, but it&amp;rsquo;s really not bad. The world-alongside-our-world of the Fae is fairly standard, the romance is mostly predictable, and there are few enough action scenes. But on the other hand, the world feels real enough, I liked Aislinn more than I had any right to, and I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued what happens next. And that&amp;rsquo;s more enough for a quick read in my opinion!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics: Iron Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/ultimate-comics-iron-man/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 17:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/ultimate-comics-iron-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>So much continues to change in the Post-Wave world&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead let’s introduce some new foe in the Mandarin. Hacking in and taking over Stark Tech. The Iron Man suit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neat idea but feels incomplete. Both in what I expected post Ultimatum and in the resolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics: X-Men, by Brian Wood, Volume 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/09/ultimate-comics-x-men-by-brian-wood-volume-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/09/ultimate-comics-x-men-by-brian-wood-volume-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Utopia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out, pretending the Sentient Seed died out lasted… not at all. Now there’s a new Mutant homeland in America…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-x-men-wood-2-textbundle-475838.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s actually really cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course Tian isn’t thrilled by the competition. It’s kind of amazing that after so long, Jean is still around. This has potential… but she’s starting with lies. I’m sure it will go well. Especially if she’s both hiding and going by her original name. Wat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it’s a neat story. If I didn’t know the Ultimate line was nearly over, I’d be intrigued. So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Downton Abbey: Season 4</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/downton-abbey-season-4/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 23:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/downton-abbey-season-4/</guid><description>Oy. After all the death and craziness of Season 3 (especially that finale&amp;hellip;), the family is all off kilter now. It takes a bit to settle, and then of course we&amp;rsquo;re on for all the more trouble.
Highlights:
Rose brings a touch of chaos Sybil never could. I&amp;rsquo;m glad they didn&amp;rsquo;t clone her. Rose is fun.
Man, Anna and Bates just don&amp;rsquo;t get an easy life, do they&amp;hellip;
Tom is in such a weird situation&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m liking his role as a sort of inbetween, of both worlds and neither.</description></item><item><title>House of Suns</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/house-of-suns/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/house-of-suns/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Everything came and went, everything was new and bright with promise once and old and worn out later, and everything left a small, diminishing stain on eternity, a mark that time would eventually erase.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>House of Suns is what really great sci-fi tries to be: it takes some fascinating ideas (generally technological), sprinkles in interesting characters (although some authors seem to find that optional), and goes from there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hercules</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/hercules/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/hercules/</guid><description>&lt;p>I somehow managed to never watch Hercules growing up. It just wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of the Disney movies we ever had.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which is a bit of a bummer, since that&amp;rsquo;s quite a good time! Better late than never though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Wolverine: Legacies</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/ultimate-comics-wolverine-legacies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/ultimate-comics-wolverine-legacies/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jimmy gets a hidden message in that hidden message with his father.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enough to reveal a tiny bit of Wolverine’s past, how Jimmy came to be (almost graphically), and who his mother/family is…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why does everyone have to be related?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a one off, meh. In the greater storyline, too late.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skip-able, unless you’re going for completion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics: X-Men, by Brian Wood, Volume 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/05/ultimate-comics-x-men-by-brian-wood-volume-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/05/ultimate-comics-x-men-by-brian-wood-volume-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>So here we go again again (again?). Another Volume 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It could have been an interesting story. The Mutant Cure. The last 20 or so mutants (in the US/public). Divisions even among them. A Mutant Seed that can cure world hunger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it’s all moving so fast I barely even have a chance to get to know anyone we didn’t already know. And those left feel different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this has been the start of Ultimate X-Men, opening with Ultimatum? That would have been cool. As it is? Meh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost to the end. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Werewolf by Night</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/05/werewolf-by-night/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/05/werewolf-by-night/</guid><description>&lt;p>I managed to skip by this last fall, much to my now dismay. It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;ndash;only sort of an MCU special; focused on the monster/&amp;lsquo;horror&amp;rsquo; side of Marvel comics rather than the super-hero business. They do open with a sillouette of the heroes we know and love&amp;hellip; before all color drains out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What comes next? An introduction to a monster hunting family/society and a competition to win the mysterious &amp;lsquo;Bloodstone&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;which gives you a sort of power over/against monsters. And then&amp;ndash;the HUNT/BATTLE ROYALE!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wakanda Forever</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/wakanda-forever/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/wakanda-forever/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How?&lt;br>
How is never as important as why.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So. How do you fill the giant Chadwick Boseman shaped hole in the MCU?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently&amp;hellip; with funeral services, Atlantis (but not), mer-Hermes (the first self described mutant in the MCU), and&amp;ndash;eventually&amp;ndash;someone new to take up the mantle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; fine?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were certainly some pretty spectacular action scenes. The under water scenes are pretty&amp;ndash;even if they only sort of make sense. The character and costume design continues to impress. And there are giant piles of funeral services and mourning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, the sudden introduction of an entire (large) underwater civilization feels&amp;hellip; weird. And as we&amp;rsquo;ve had before with the Marvel movies, some of the big battle set pieces don&amp;rsquo;t make that much sense. They&amp;rsquo;re going out on a boat to fight water people. All to&amp;hellip; limit how many fighters they have to film? And then all but like ten people die and we&amp;rsquo;re just okay with that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s about the middle of the road so far as Marvel movies go for me. Pretty good, decent action, but there have been better entries. Pretty high up for 2023, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably more because I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen that many movies this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Ultimates by Sam Humphries, Vol. 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/ultimate-comics-ultimates-by-sam-humphries-vol.-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/ultimate-comics-ultimates-by-sam-humphries-vol.-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>President Cap. Hydra. Fury doing Fury things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s certainly a jam packed volume… but for all that happens, what has actually changed?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feels like they’re trying to reboot a reboot while holding together entirely too much damage they (the writers) have done to this version of the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall: it’s fine, but I’m not surprised that this line doesn’t last long. Being yet another Volume 1 doesn’t help. Onward!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: Cap is a terrible President. 😃&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Winnie the Pooh: A Very Merry Pooh Year</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/winnie-the-pooh-a-very-merry-pooh-year/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/winnie-the-pooh-a-very-merry-pooh-year/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s Winnie the Pooh&amp;ndash;but now at Christmas time! Not sure how much else there is to say.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I so remember the old Winnie the Pooh &amp;amp; Christmas Too (from 1991). Man the nostalgia when the bugs (and their Napoleabug leader) sound the charge. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know when I would have watched it, but I remember that part!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s cute. The kids enjoyed it. It&amp;rsquo;s probably not something I&amp;rsquo;d ever choose to watch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Spider-Man by Brian Michael Bendis, Volume 4</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/30/ultimate-comics-spider-man-by-brian-michael-bendis-volume-4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/30/ultimate-comics-spider-man-by-brian-michael-bendis-volume-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Miles is new on the job—and already too many people know (or suspect that he’s Spider-Man).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-spider-man-4-textbundle-258b1c.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do like this Jameson.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, that list includes Venom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now we’ve got to deal with the tragic origin part of Spider-Man stories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Spider-Man by Brian Michael Bendis, Volume 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/29/ultimate-comics-spider-man-by-brian-michael-bendis-volume-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/29/ultimate-comics-spider-man-by-brian-michael-bendis-volume-3/</guid><description>Unless I misread something, this is included as 1/3 of Ultimate Comics: Divided We Fall, United We Stand, for the most part overlapping with that story: the fall and rise of America in this crazy Ultimate Universe.
But here, we also get a lot more of the story of Miles and Uncle Aaron. Which is a bit more violent and brutal (and quick) than in Into the Spider-Verse (I think? I might be misremembering), since he&amp;rsquo;s the main protagonist.</description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics: Divided We Fall, United We Stand</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/29/ultimate-comics-divided-we-fall-united-we-stand/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/29/ultimate-comics-divided-we-fall-united-we-stand/</guid><description>&lt;p>Things are … slightly more broken then I realized.&lt;/p>

Spider-Man. ♫&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/spider-men-textbundle-3d6beb.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we have TWO Spider-Men.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s another part of what became Into the Spider-Verse, with another Peter Parker getting shot across dimensions and meeting Miles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s good fun all around. I’m glad to see the two get a chance to meet. And I’m going to have to check out some main universe Spider-Man at some point!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I do wonder… what’s Fury going to do now that he knows about parallel realities… or apparently what Stark might do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics: X-Men, Volume 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/28/ultimate-comics-x-men-volume-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/28/ultimate-comics-x-men-volume-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Flooded New York. Blew up DC. Wiped out large chucks of Europe. Sentinels on the loose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel like it’s just so much diverging, so many deaths… at some point it just doesn’t land any more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I suppose we’re building up to another big event, but at this point, I’m mostly waiting to see how it all ends.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Ultimates by Jonathan Hickman, Vol. 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/25/ultimate-comics-ultimates-by-jonathan-hickman-vol.-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/25/ultimate-comics-ultimates-by-jonathan-hickman-vol.-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-ultimates-2-textbundle-87e0ba.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well that escalated again’ly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given the number of sudden super powered threats, it’s not over surprising. But in a world reeling… I’m doubtful we’ll get the gravitas this deserves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot certainly happens, but I find it hard to be invested in any of it. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Dead Town</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/24/the-dead-town/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/24/the-dead-town/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it ends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A direct sequel to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/09/lost-souls/">Lost Souls&lt;/a>, we finish up with Victor (etc) and his nanomachine replacements out in Montana.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of cool seeing the rugged, individual, hyper-&amp;ldquo;American&amp;rdquo; characters fight back. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit much at times, but I enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a conclusion to even two books, let alone five&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s fine? It does tie up most of the threats. But on the other hand, it&amp;rsquo;s all build up and &amp;hellip; just ends. I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of that. And barely any of the monsters/big bads from the first three books come back&amp;hellip; Just Erika and Jocko. Of all the things to keep&amp;hellip; why Jocko?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth finishing once I&amp;rsquo;d come that far, but it really is the sort of series you could probably finish at the first book and not miss mutch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Witch's Heart</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/23/the-witchs-heart/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/23/the-witchs-heart/</guid><description>&lt;p>It seems no matter the culture, myths and legends get weird. Norse mythology is &lt;em>absolutely&lt;/em> no exception to that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this story, we have a novelization of the story of Angrboda. Wife of Loki. Mother of monsters. She&amp;rsquo;s been around a while (it&amp;rsquo;s mythology, even she doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how long) and she just wants to be left alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like seeing a slightly more &amp;lsquo;raw&amp;rsquo; Norse mythology, especially than you get from (for example) the Marvel universe(s).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a bonkers story. You never know what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen. Being built on myths, the world is flexible at best. Rules are made to be broken. And that&amp;rsquo;s before you have gods et al with the ability to rewrite reality / see the future / move from world to world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed it. Worth a read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, Volume 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/22/ultimate-comics-spider-man-volume-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/22/ultimate-comics-spider-man-volume-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Miles coming into his own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Old enemies are &lt;strong>thrilled&lt;/strong> to have Spider-Man back. Wisecracks and all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New ones? More of a mixed bag. I’m enjoying this Prowler even more than the Intro the Spider-Verse version.&lt;/p>

So mutants? Not in a great place after Magneto’s wave.
The ones that are left are on the run and there are more than a few factions teeing to hunt them down.
And as if that weren’t enough, add in the new forces in SEAR. And others.
Oh it’s a wonderful mess. Dark. But it has potential.

&lt;p>He’s been around this whole time… and only sort of in the spotlight. Which I suppose us par for the course for him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s interesting getting a bit more about what else was going on right when Reed came back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-hawkeye-textbundle-7e7e94.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-ultimates-textbundle-ece1a9.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>… and things are going very. very sideways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because there’s a new* villain in town.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-ultimates-textbundle-a83ac9.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I did not realize that he originally came from the Ultimates universe. So this is actually a new origin story!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pretty cool. It’s interesting seeing what made it into Into the Spider-Verse—and what didn’t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do wish we’d had a chance to see Peter and Miles interact more, but I think this will work out. It’s got a lot of potential.&lt;/p>

If you visit a world where another you is still alive, you die.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why have I survived? Because I am a creature more devious than all the other mes put together. Because I saw myself bleeding out and instead of checking for a pulse, I began collecting her things. I survive the desert like a coyote survives, like all tricksters do.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating premise, especially when you dig just a bit deeper: Who are the people most likely able to jump? Who&amp;rsquo;s the most likely to have died on other worlds?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a story about privilege. About a world built for the rich and powerful&amp;ndash;by those who have nothing or less; those that pay everything and get nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Cara is stuck right in the middle of it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Logan</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/17/logan/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/17/logan/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I finally got to watch Logan.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Laura: You are dying. You want to die.&lt;br>
Logan: How do you know?&lt;br>
Laura: Charles told me.&lt;br>
Logan: What else did he tell you?&lt;br>
Laura: To not let you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a gritty, brutal sort of R rating that really lets you see the darker side of what a world with superpowers could be&amp;ndash;without the twisted sort of humor that Deadpool has to take the edge off. The action is quick. It&amp;rsquo;s bloody. And they &amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t hold back. It&amp;rsquo;s not the sort of superhero movie that you may always want to see, but I think that it&amp;rsquo;s one worth watching. At least once.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Cartographers</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/16/the-cartographers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/16/the-cartographers/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Cartography, at its heart, was about defining one&amp;rsquo;s place in the world by creating charts and measurements. Nell had lived her life by that idea, that everything could be mapped according to references and thereby understood. But she could see now that she had been paying attention to the wrong references.&lt;br>
It was not a map alone that made a place real.&lt;br>
It was the people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a tricky one to review. It&amp;rsquo;ll take some minor spoilers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell (if you want to completely avoid spoilers), it&amp;rsquo;s a decent book with a fascinating premise that could have done so much more for the actual execution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Spider-Man: Death of Spider-Man Fallout</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/14/ultimate-comics-spider-man-death-of-spider-man-fallout/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/14/ultimate-comics-spider-man-death-of-spider-man-fallout/</guid><description>&lt;p>I feel like we’ve &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/16/ultimatum-requiem/">been here before&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But this time around, as much as it is about endings… it’s also about new beginnings (see below, spoilers). Which is kind of a bummer. We really needed more time to breath and process, but this all feels like setting up whatever comes next.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Zeroes, not Heroes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That was fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s the story of six American teenagers who discover they have superpowers. And fairly atypical ones too. A Voice that says exactly what needs to be said&amp;ndash;for better or for worse. Being immediately forgotten. Crashing electronics all around you. Controlling mobs. Leadership (somehow different from mobs). Seeing through others&amp;rsquo; eyes.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Maybe Flicker&amp;rsquo;s power made her think differently than most people. She saw the world from so many perspectives, and seeing was half of enlightenment.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So. Is he finally going to hang up the mask for good? (again) A metaphorical sort of death?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or, given that it&amp;rsquo;s the Ultimate Marvel Universe&amp;hellip; is Peter Parker himself the next on chopping block?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of all the Ultimate Marvel titles, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/ultimate-spider-man/">Ultimate Spider-Man&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/ultimate-comics-spider-man-2009/">continued&lt;/a>) has been by far the most consistently good.

&lt;p>Pride can become arrogance. Arrogance is the father of cruelty. But in the beginning, there was also an idealism, a hope that he could change the human condition.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; fine. It&amp;rsquo;s got all the bits you&amp;rsquo;d need for a thriller, but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel the villains as much. And there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>not really and ending&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s very much part 1 of 2. At this point, you could easily stop at book 3&amp;hellip; or read on to finish book 5.

&lt;p>Take the extremist end of the American Protestant religious right. Give them everything they want (plus some) over the span of years (if not months).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Men have taken absolute power. In a world with (dramatically) declining birth rates, women are owned by the state. Their bodies are nothing more than a vessel for their wombs. They can&amp;rsquo;t travel alone, can&amp;rsquo;t be seen, can&amp;rsquo;t own property.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like any good story of this sort, it takes a potential problem&amp;ndash;an idea&amp;ndash;and turns it up to eleven. It goes steps further than anything we&amp;rsquo;ve seen in modern times&amp;ndash;or at least differently. The closest analogue I&amp;rsquo;m aware of is probably the events around the Iranian Revolution in 1979. By 1981, hijab were mandatory (there&amp;rsquo;s more to the history there; even before, hijab were seen as a method of protest against Westernization). Given this book was released in 1985, it seems&amp;hellip; potentially related.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; terrifying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the more so, for all those men (often in positions of power) that even today see it less as a cautionary tale and more something to aspire to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Stories always begin the same way: There was and there was not. There is possibility in those words, the chance for hope or despair.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

Not with a bang, nor with a whimper, but with a roar. Mostly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, we get the end of Napolean and the wars that have engulfed Europe and a good chunk of the world. Dragons from all over, thousands of them, fighting in the air and on the ground. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty epic and what I had hoped the series would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, we don&amp;rsquo;t actually get a number of those big moments. There is plenty of dragon conflict, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, but there&amp;rsquo;s also a lot missing. Lien. There&amp;rsquo;s an ending, but how did we get there? No big speeches, no dragon generals squaring off, no big final battle. Just fait accompli.

I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there&amp;rsquo;s a series that&amp;rsquo;s had a serious amnesia storyline I actually liked and this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the exception.

&lt;p>Today, Peter is dating Gwen Stacy instead of Mary Jane and working at a mall food court instead of the now defunct Daily Bugle. Mutants are outlawed and the growing threat of the mysterious Mysterio takes the life of the once untouchable Kingpin of crime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All that and after all these months, Johnny Storm, aka the Human Torch, reappears at Peter&amp;rsquo;s doorstep, exhausted and homeless.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that’s a switch. Especially considering at first everyone thought him dead… but I suppose in this case at least we never actually saw the body.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, I’m aware of the irony, given for example Gwen.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“They are ours,” he said, “although not properly the sailors: they are only along because we would not leave them to drown, and ought to be more grateful for it than they are. Laurence,” he said, turning, “this is Palta, and that man is called Taruca: Iskierka snatched him, and I cannot find she asked him in the least.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s an interesting one. On one hand, I&amp;rsquo;m glad they&amp;rsquo;re out of Australia. Instead, they&amp;rsquo;re off across the Pacific&amp;hellip; to Brazil and the Portuguese royal family. Of course things don&amp;rsquo;t go as expected. Crossing the Pacific is one mess and meeting up with the Inca and how they deal with dragons was pretty fascinating&amp;ndash;they&amp;rsquo;re still a power to be reckoned with in this world, mostly on the backs of their local dragons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s still not up to the strengths of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/13/victory-of-eagles/">Victory of Eagles&lt;/a>, mostly because the travels and exploration was never the original draw of the series&amp;ndash;the Napoleon but &lt;em>dragons&lt;/em> was, and we&amp;rsquo;ve scant little of that.

A hard one to rate at that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, we get a conclusion of sorts of Victor Helios né Frankenstein&amp;rsquo;s mad plan to take over New Orleans (and then the world!) and replace all us flawed Old Race with his New Race&amp;hellip; and various other critters. It&amp;rsquo;s a story that&amp;rsquo;s been quite building up for three books now and it&amp;rsquo;s great to see it come to a head of sorts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Really, these should all have been one giant omnibus. Cut out a few plotlines and it works. At it was, they only sort of end, up until now. And even that is generous&amp;ndash;there are an awful many plotlines still unresolved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, an awful lot of this book really seemed to get away from Victor&amp;rsquo;s master plan and dig more into all of the weird things that have been going wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We get Harker&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; baby? of sorts! And it&amp;rsquo;s played more for laughs than anything, which I did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> expect. Takes a bit away from the previous scenes, IMO. We get the continuation of security man turns chimera, which is still pretty cool and terrifying, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t really go where I&amp;rsquo;d hope. There&amp;rsquo;s some chameleon monster. Again, cool but really underused. And we get a trash dump monster. They&amp;rsquo;ve been dumping all of these horrors&amp;ndash;and they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em>designed&lt;/em> to survive. So this makes sense. But I&amp;rsquo;m not at all happy with how it went. As it was, that plot alone needed an entire book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, the &amp;lsquo;good guys&amp;rsquo; seem much less impactful than I&amp;rsquo;d like. Deucalion&amp;rsquo;s bouncing around causing Victor trouble, but without any &lt;em>really&lt;/em> satisfying pay off (in my opinion). Carson and Michael and still delightful with the banter&amp;ndash;and totally outclassed&amp;ndash;but again, it only sort of goes anywhere.&lt;/p>
