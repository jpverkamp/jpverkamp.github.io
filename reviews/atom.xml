      <title>Still Life</title>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there&amp;rsquo;s that. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit out of genre for me&amp;ndash;read by group choice, so I really don&amp;rsquo;t know how it compares to it&amp;rsquo;s peer books, but I enjoyed it well enough. It was certainly fascinating to read at the same time as &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;28962996&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28962996.six-wakes&#34;&gt;Six Wakes&lt;/a&gt; (which, to be honest, I enjoyed rather more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the plot is fine. It&amp;rsquo;s a murder mystery. There are a few decent bits of interesting world building. It&amp;rsquo;s a small town with what seems to me an unusually large art scene and number of bow hunters. There are some witchy bits which really made me wish this was actually subtle urban fantasy. And a few twists and turns along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Sopranos: Season 2</title>
      <link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/27/the-sopranos-season-2/</link>

      <description>Man this show just keeps going.
They actually lowered the amount of nudity a bit from Season 1 (as HBO tends to do), but the violence is still going strong… It’s fascinating (and solid writing) to see the fall out from the big events of season 1, along with entirely new plotlines with Janice (Tony’s brother), Richard Aprile (who’s got crazy eyes), Christopher really getting into (and out of) writing, and drama with the entire Soprano family/children.</description>

      <title>The Sweet Far Thing</title>

                &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;127459&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127459.the-sweet-far-thing&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/the-sweet-far-thing.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a sigh, I resign myself to combing through it page by page, though 502
pages is so many to wade through, and I curse authors who write such lengthy
books when a few neat pages of prose would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Roughly halfway through a nearly 1000 page book&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Six Wakes</title>
      <link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/19/six-wakes/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;figure class=&#34;cover-image&#34;&gt;
                &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;28962996&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28962996.six-wakes&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/six-wakes.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;28962996&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28962996.six-wakes&#34;&gt;Six Wakes&lt;/a&gt; is a closed room murder mystery in SPACE! With clones! What that gives us is an absolutely wonderful variation on the tropes. Because of cloning technology, you can very well have a murder mystery where the cast wake up to the gruesome (zero gee) murder of &amp;hellip; the entire cast. And because it&amp;rsquo;s a generation ship in deep space, you very well know that one of the cast absolutely has to have been the muderer&amp;hellip; Unless it was more than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite parts of the worldbuilding all really revolve around technology of cloning and how that can change the world in fascinating ways. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon for attendees at certain parties to end murdered. They&amp;rsquo;ll wake up in the morning, restored from a backup the day before with little more than a feeling of &amp;lsquo;that must have been one hell of a party&amp;rsquo; plus some potential embarrassment and go about their lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;54493401&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401.project-hail-mary&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/project-hail-mary.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh that&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful book. If your read and enjoyed &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;18007564&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564.the-martian&#34;&gt; The Martian &lt;/a&gt; , you&amp;rsquo;ll almost certainly love &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;54493401&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401.project-hail-mary&#34;&gt; Project Hail Mary &lt;/a&gt; . The sense of humor mixed with scientific/engineering problem solving is the main strength in both. Great fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s got a wonderful sense of humor:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Monsters in the Dark: The Making of X-COM: UFO Defense</title>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X-COM holds a special place in my life. It was one of if not the very first computer games I bought. I played the heck out of that game; I bought the strategy guide (and got one for Apocalypse, even though I didn’t yet own it) and still fire up an emulator to give it a try every year or three. It’s just a wonderful tactics game, the like of which I’ve never really managed to find again—at least to my tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I saw the Kickstarter for a Monsters in the Dark, I knew I had to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Crafting Interpreters</title>
      <link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/12/crafting-interpreters/</link>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming languages are something of a hobby of mine. Going as far back as undergrad, I’ve written a fair few interpreters and compilers over the years. I’ve never really gotten beyond a strong basic level, but I’ve always wanted to. Crafting Interpreters is a great book for exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book essentially walks you through two styles of interpreter of the same language: just an AST walking style written in Java (the sort I’ve done a few times) and then a much more optimized one based on bytecode. There was something to learn on both sections though, since the the introduced language (lox) includes higher order functions and closures—certainly more interesting bits of languages to implement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reviews of &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;53152636&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53152636.mexican-gothic&#34;&gt; Mexican Gothic &lt;/a&gt; are &amp;hellip; divided to say the least. There&amp;rsquo;s more than a handfull of glowing five star reviews and a smaller but still significant number that just didn&amp;rsquo;t get what the fuss was about. Halfway through&amp;hellip; I totally get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the main problem is the absolute tonal shift that happens about halfway through the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Rounding out the first 8 series that are available directly on YouTube in the US, finally Series 7!
Man this was a season. Man those are some characters. James Acaster has a barely contained rage beneath his humor (sometimes now so barely). Jessica Knappett, hilarious with some crazy outfits. Kerry Godliman: a wonderfully direct way to solving tasks. Phil Wang (and Phil Wang&amp;rsquo;s wang). That outfit&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s certainly a thing.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Continuing the story of the greater world, bringing everything together. Hatred and lies all aimed at eliminating Paradis and the people there&amp;hellip; and only a small group from Paradis to try to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps more&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>After the crazy violence and nudity of Watchmen, you&amp;rsquo;d think perhaps we&amp;rsquo;d go for something a little more &amp;hellip; safe for next time around.
Nah.
The Sopranos.
It&amp;rsquo;s one of the best rated TV shows of all time (on IMDb, only Breaking Bad (which I watched just before I started reviewing TV series), Avatar: The Last Airbender (it&amp;rsquo;s great), and Game of Thrones (pre Season 8) are rated higher among fiction).</description>

      <title>The Borrowers Afloat</title>
      <link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/03/the-borrowers-afloat/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/03/the-borrowers-afloat/</guid>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a cute little addition to the Borrower’s world. After being ousted from their first home to live out of doors for a book, the Borrowers get another chance at ‘civilization’, this time even with family around! But alas, all is soon to end and off they go on another adventure, trying to find another life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fun story, full of tiny adventures. While again, the ending and the frame story are by far the weakest parts of these books, they’re still great fun and well worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh this extended world. The idea that there is a race of people (the Eldians) with a special power unique to their people which makes them makes them hated and feared, relegated to a suppressed class. Except a minor few that are brain washed and weaponized. It&amp;rsquo;s a story we&amp;rsquo;ve heard time and time again, even going back throughout history, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s a bad story. It&amp;rsquo;s one that really needs to be told.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two in a row! It&amp;rsquo;s like Christmas! If Christmas was chuck full of creepy uberpowerful fae&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major plot threads is dealing with the fallout of &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;25026912&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25026912.storm-cursed&#34;&gt; Storm Cursed &lt;/a&gt; . Mercy and co may have won the day, but in doing so they managed to tick off a great number of very powerful beings, lost a strong ally, and may have caused some permanent harm to Adam and Mercy&amp;rsquo;s relationship. I really hated this at first&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve loved how solid the relationships of the main characters are in these books, letting them deal with huge problems together&amp;ndash;but by the end I&amp;rsquo;m at least willing to see where this goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fascinating change of scope. After so long on what we thought of as the entire world (although of course we&amp;rsquo;d guessed it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case), now we have an entire much larger world, more advanced in a lot of ways both in science and knowing about Titans. Crazy times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus a bit more backstory of Reiner and a handful of new characters that purposely are training to be Titans, all to willingly take on the Titans for only 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last re-read/listen through the Mercy Thompson books. I had forgotten just host much things had been changing on a larger world building scale in the last few books: since Mercy put herself and her pack on the line defending the people and territory of the Columbia Basin, things have gotten complicated. And dark. And did I mention complicated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating world building.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have hated words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As grim and depressing as a book set around Nazi Germany narrated by death can be, I actually quite enjoyed this story. Zusak certainly has quite a way with words and the story is alternatively terrifying (in a way that makes you think) and touching (likewise).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that&amp;rsquo;s a switch. We have a notebook talking about Eren&amp;rsquo;s father&amp;rsquo;s life outside of the walls, just how large the rest of the world is, and how the Attack Titan came to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what in the world are they going to do?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>And so it begins again.
While Stargate SG-1 really has a solid place in my heart, in a way I like Atlantis even better. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it could have been what it is without SG-1, but with it, it&amp;rsquo;s made even better.
You have a generally optimistic can do attitude, backed up by McKay quite often saving the day (which is crazy coming off SG-1, I forgot how annoying he is and just how much he grows throughout the seasons of Atlantis).</description>

      <description>From one of the weakest MCU movies to one of the strongest. I loved the first solo entry of Captain American and the second is even better. Much like last time, I very much enjoyed this movie.
It&amp;rsquo;s a solid contrast against the first Captain America (blind optimistic patriotism versus a darker world, where even your friends&amp;hellip; might not be). It&amp;rsquo;s made all the better having already seen the future of Sam and Bucky/The Winter Soldier now.</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So close and yet so far. So many are dead, trying to (did they succeed after all) to take down the Beast Titan. And now they have a choice. Theoretically, they can steal one of the Titan&amp;rsquo;s abilities and save one of their own&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Finally back to where it all began. We have a bit of trying to find the show&amp;rsquo;s footing. I think Romesh Ranganathan was my favorite this series.
Favorite task:
 Episode 1, Task 2: Eat as much watermelon as possible in one minute. HULK SMASH! Also, totally throwing up.  It&amp;rsquo;s probably the weakest season, but it more than gets a pass for all the wonderful things that came to be later.</description>

      <description>I really like most of the people in this season. Alice Levine seems straight laced and perhaps sweet until she throws something at you out of left field. Asim Chaudhry hit the &amp;lsquo;you&amp;rsquo;re going to lose now&amp;rsquo;, although didn&amp;rsquo;t actually end up coming in last. Tim Vine though&amp;hellip; oh Tim Vine. There always has to be one in a crazy outfit and he performs most of the tasks in some sort of safari outfit and hat.</description>

      <description>Oh Noel Fielding. You&amp;rsquo;re &amp;hellip; a class all your own. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many other people that had so very many 1 and 5 point tasks with little in between. Having Mel Giedroyc there as well (also from the Great British Bake Off) was extra amusing. Another favorite of mine though was Hugh Dennis. So very British sense of humor.
Favorite tasks:
 Episode 1, Task 1: Most unusual autograph on the most unusual vegetable.</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, Fire Touched manages to back down from the scale of the previous two books. We&amp;rsquo;re no longer fighting primordial spirits or gods, but rather &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; the Fae. Of course, as we see through the course of the book, there are some Fae who might as well be gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, this book as many as any that came before will really change the shape of the future of the universe that Briggs is building. In a nutshell, the wolves are going politically toe to toe with the Fae. Anything more than that would be even more a spoiler, but it&amp;rsquo;s still another interesting bit of worldbuilding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Take the wall! Fight fight Titan fight! Crazy new technology to level the playing field. Fun times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the more fascinating bits is finding out even more crazy things that the Human/Titans can do with their powers. It remains believable but insane levels of power. You do sort of get why they view ‘normal’ humanity as something less to be eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>One problem that comic book universes in general and the MCU in specific have always had is that of scale. How in the world do you have a man in a suit, a literal &amp;lsquo;god&amp;rsquo;, a rage monster, a super soldier, and a couple &amp;hellip; regular people ever interact on the same scale? For the most part, it&amp;rsquo;s hand waved away. Everyone is paired up with an opponent of roughly the same power level and we move on with our lives.</description>

      <description>Back one more!
Richard Osman is just wonderful in this season. He can really give Greg Davies a run for his money. But I think even better is Katherine Ryan. She&amp;rsquo;s snarky and hilarious. I wish they had more than one woman on the earlier seasons, but if you only have one, she was a good one!

      <description>Oof. On one hand, Watchmen is a very HBO show. Violence all over the place, blood spraying, nudity (both male and female), language.
On another hand, it&amp;rsquo;s Watchmen. At first, it feels like a completely new story set in the same world. There are vague comments relating to the series, but where the graphic novel (I need to reread that) and movie were set decades ago closer to where Watchmen&amp;rsquo;s Alternate Reality splits, this show starts and mostly stays in the world of the 2010s America.</description>

      <description>Further back! Season 3!
I don&amp;rsquo;t have as much to say about the contestants this time around, except for Paul Chowdhry. Such a resting emotionless face&amp;hellip; unless he&amp;rsquo;s full of a deep rage. It makes it hilarious. And he got robbed&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s starting to seem kinda racist. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s just my own viewing order?
A few favorite moments:

      <description>For some reason, I Iron Man 3 as a fairly week entry, but looking back to when I last watched it in theaters&amp;hellip; I actually liked it about as much then I do now.
On one hand, I really do still think they absolutely nailed Robert Downey Jr. as Iron man. He can do both funny and broken pretty well and has more than a few chances for each this time around.</description>

Contestants:
 Aisling Bea: Irish names are kind of crazy looking sometimes. And so is Aisling Bea. She has a wonderful sort of manic energy throughout the show. Bob Mortimer: He has some of the most bananas ways of solving tasks. Great fun. Mark Watson: A wonderfully dry sense of humor. You can never quite be sure if he&amp;rsquo;s serious or messing with you.</description>

      <description>Shang Tsung: FINISH THEM!
 Mortal Kombat is an odd sort of movie. With 2 dozen games, 2 previous live action and 2 animated films, and all manner of other references and media, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of backstory going on. But really, it all comes down to some sort of otherworldly nasties coming to conquer the Earth, but they can only do so if they defeat Earth&amp;rsquo;s champion(s). Other than that, it&amp;rsquo;s really a vehicle for hand to hand combat of the most violent sort.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Things continue to heat up (heh). Attack by a crawling mess of a Titan on the wall versus Eren and a bundle of explosives. Historia ascending. The Beast Titan. It’s a crazy story.&lt;/p&gt;

In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s the most historical account of Corrie ten Boom&amp;ndash;a older, unmarried devoutly Christian woman who lived in Holland before, during, and a bit after World War II. It tells the story of how she became the center of one group hiding and getting Jews out of the city and eventually paid the price for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s (unfortunately) not a story we haven&amp;rsquo;t heard before, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read one from the perspective of a devout Christian. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how her religion drives her decisions, giving her the strength and hope to overcome all manner of problems throughout her life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Man it just keeps getting crazier and crazier. On one hand, we have more and more human on human violence in a giant underground columns set piece, perfect for their vertical maneuvering equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello! You must be Maximilian! Your uncle here is delighted to be hosting you.” The teeth on the skull curved up. “The name’s Conner, in case you were wondering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They can talk?” I whispered to my uncle.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, that all comes to an end at the end of book 1, sending them off into the great outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</title>

      <description>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier basically takes place where Avengers: Endgame left off. Steve Rogers as Captain America has stepped down, leaving his shield to Sam Wilson/The Falcon/the (rumored) future Captain America. And on a superficial level, that&amp;rsquo;s about where it ends: Sam Wilson has the shield and is expected to take up the mantle of Captain America.
But, oh the story it tells along the way.
On one hand, you have the dynamic between titular Falcon and Winter Soldier.</description>

      <description>That was a far better movie (in my opinion) than The Ark of Truth. It basically felt like a slightly higher budget two part episode (although those already tended to be good) of the series and actually gave a chance to say goodbye to a few more people: In particularly Ba&amp;rsquo;al (RIP) and O&amp;rsquo;Neill, who really needed it. Not to mention a callback to the real villains of the show: The Goa&amp;rsquo;uld.</description>

      <description>You know, that was more enjoyable than I think it had any right to be. It&amp;rsquo;s the sort of movie that would have been far more spectacular on a big screen, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been to the theaters in a while, so I&amp;rsquo;ll take smaller.
All around, it&amp;rsquo;s a visual delight. Transporting Kong is hilarious looking. The Hollow Earth is an insane idea, but it&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful world and all of those big beasties to fight are a lot of fun to see.</description>

      <description>Stargate: The Ark of Truth is the first of two direct-to-video sequels to SG-1. This one picks up after the SG-1 series finale and concludes the Ori arc and throws in a number of other callbacks along the way.
 Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell: It&#39;s kind of weird not having a big bad guy to fight anymore. Lt. Colonel Samantha Carter: Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s how we felt when we defeated the Goa&amp;rsquo;uld.</description>

      <description>The Good Place is an absolute gem of a show. It&amp;rsquo;s hilarious, it&amp;rsquo;s touching, and it even manages to make you think.
I watched the first three seasons a year or more ago, before the 4th season was out (let alone on Netflix), so it&amp;rsquo;s a bit out of order, but from the beginning or jumping in on season 4, it&amp;rsquo;s a show well worth watching.
In a nutshell, the main characters die and end up in the afterlife: The Good Place.</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the &amp;gt; shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you &amp;gt; could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices… &amp;gt; Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your &amp;gt; regrets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that&amp;rsquo;s a surprisingly wonderful story. It&amp;rsquo;s something of a mix of It&amp;rsquo;s a Wonderful Life and Borges&#39; The Library of Babel. Nora Seed finds herself in a dark place, between life and death&amp;ndash;and that place just happens to look to her like a library. A library with a book for every life she could have lived, every choice she could have made.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Whoo boy. And so it ends. It&amp;rsquo;s a different sort of excellent from the peak of early SG-1, but the new team is really gelling, the Ori are a decent new threat, and it&amp;rsquo;s quite a ride to go out on. Not all shows end so well. I&amp;rsquo;m happy with this.
Excellent episodes: The Pegasus Project, crossover with Atlantis! 200, the best parody episode ever. The Quest: Part 1/2, a big team up with SG-1, Ba&amp;rsquo;al, and even eventually Adria, off to find a magic doodad&amp;ndash;plus, a dragon!</description>
