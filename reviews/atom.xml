&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Well that was quite a continuation. Out of one apocalypse and right into another. This time in the 1960s!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat concept and gives the characters a bit more time to grow&amp;ndash;while at the same time the viewers know there&amp;rsquo;s quite the timeline. And with time travel&amp;hellip; you can kill people off and still have to deal with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also instead of Hazel and Cha-Chat, you have three Swedish brothers (less amusing, far more terrifying).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I quite enjoyed it. And there&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;em>plenty&lt;/em> of room left for Season 3. A quick search shows February 2022&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m going to go with a probably not on that. But still soon!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Schitt's Creek: Season 4</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/20/schitts-creek-season-4/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/20/schitts-creek-season-4/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/schitts-creek-season-4.jpg"/>

&lt;p>Death pregnancy; the Rose children growing up, Johnny finally has something to do, and Moira is&amp;hellip; Moira. Oy&amp;ndash;ra.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a bit amused that we got the pregnancy storyline &lt;span class="spoiler">without Jocelyn's actress even being pregnant IRL; I feel like that's the more common reason to work in something like this. It works though!&lt;/span>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fun season. Onward we barrel towards the end.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Umbrella Academy: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/17/the-umbrella-academy-season-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/17/the-umbrella-academy-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/umbrella-academy-1.jpg"/>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>On the 12th hour of the first day of October 1989, 43 women around the world gave birth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was unusual only in the fact that none of these women had been pregnant when the day first began.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sir Reginald Hargreeves, eccentric billionaire and adventurer, resolved to locate and adopt as many of the children as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh that&amp;rsquo;s quite a show. After &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/23/the-umbrella-academy-vol.-1-the-apocalypse-suite/">reading through the graphic novels&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s a rather different experience. The core is the same, even if details are a bit different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Colm Feore as Reginald Hargreeves is my favorite casting. He reminds me as Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym in Ant-Man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward to season 2!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Encanto</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/13/encanto/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/13/encanto/</guid><description>Disney has really been doing quite well the last 12 years. Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6, Moana, and now Encanto? (I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen Raya yet) All really solid films. Encanto specifically, I really enjoyed. It&amp;rsquo;s got great songs, fun characters, beautiful animation, and a lovely story. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to see a story based on yet another culture&amp;ndash;Columbia this time&amp;ndash;Disney is really doing that well. Overall, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t quite put it to the level of Moana, but it&amp;rsquo;s just about there.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 15: Highwater</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/13/hellblazer-vol.-15-highwater/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/13/hellblazer-vol.-15-highwater/</guid><description>It’s… fine? I enjoyed the first two longer stories well enough but the latter one was all kinds of weird. And not in a way I cared for?
Onward! Maybe to something new?
Individual thoughts (spoilers):
Lapdogs and Englishmen That’s what I was looking for. Great art style, interesting story. Bit of magic (ish), bits of fate.
Oh Constantine. It fits though. 5
And then suddenly young punk Constantine.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 14: Good Intentions</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/11/hellblazer-vol.-14-good-intentions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/11/hellblazer-vol.-14-good-intentions/</guid><description>That’s a few hard hitting stories. Hard Times is about Constantine in prison. Weird art style and hard to read. Good Intentions is the aftermath… people are terrible. Freezes Over it’s a pretty good locked room mystery with just the possibility of something more.
Overall, good but not the best Constantine. Needs more out and out unambiguous supernatural IMO.
Onwards!

I&amp;rsquo;ve long been interested in alife, artificial evolution, simulated creatures, etc, and have been looking to add back in more non-fiction so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d go ahead and give it a whirl.
Overal though, it seems&amp;hellip; rather lackluster. I guess if you&amp;rsquo;re just getting into the field, it&amp;rsquo;s a good summary of what all is involved, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get more than a page into detail about absolutely anything.</description></item><item><title>Schitt's Creek: Season 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/08/schitts-creek-season-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/08/schitts-creek-season-3/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/schitts-creek-season-3.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s really picking up now! I&amp;rsquo;m actually starting to really enjoy the relationships between the characters. David is still my favorite, but Alexis ia really growing on me. And I still don&amp;rsquo;t care much for Moira.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The entire idea of David not having a (valid) driver&amp;rsquo;s license or Alexis never having graduated High School because rich/reasons&amp;hellip; actually makes a lot of sense. But Alexis actually &lt;em>going&lt;/em> to High School? In what universe would that happen&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s what GEDs are for. Really pulled me out of the plotline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than that, an enjoyable enough season. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how quickly shows with shorter episodes go by&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Labyrinth of Scions and Sorcery</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/04/a-labyrinth-of-scions-and-sorcery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/04/a-labyrinth-of-scions-and-sorcery/</guid><description>An Alchemy of Masques and Mirrors was a delightful surprise of a book, with unique/excellent worldbuilding, fun characters, great wordsmithing, and a solid mystery of a plot. A Labyrinth of Scions and Sorcery has all three once again, although we mostly lose the mystery of the of first book and get a bunch of politics instead. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, it&amp;rsquo;s still great, it just took me a bit to get into the tonal shift.</description></item><item><title>The Wyrmling Horde</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/04/the-wyrmling-horde/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/04/the-wyrmling-horde/</guid><description>I think that for the most part The Wyrmling Horde takes everything I mentioned in Worldbinder and does a bit more of that. There are some really fascinating worldbuilding ideas being explored here, although I miss the smaller scope of just the Endowments and possibly the wizards of the early books. The characters are cool&amp;ndash;and I do actually find the inversions of several of them fascinating&amp;ndash;but we&amp;rsquo;re also missing a few faces that I really wish we would see more of.</description></item><item><title>Brothers of War The Iron Brigade at Gettysburg</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/03/brothers-of-war-the-iron-brigade-at-gettysburg/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/03/brothers-of-war-the-iron-brigade-at-gettysburg/</guid><description>“But at a great cost,” Williams continued, looking at the men and pointing in the direction where the Nineteenth suffered so horrendously. “The cost will be felt in hundreds of homes, factories, and farms back in Indiana…not only now, but for generations.

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Much better than season 1! It&amp;rsquo;s still cringe, but at least David is trying, Alexis is failing, and their parents are&amp;hellip; surviving?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I appreciate about this season is how the rest of the cast is getting slightly less caricaturish. Roland is still full on Roland, but Jocelyn is really growing into a good person who&amp;rsquo;s still perfectly fine at snarking at the Rose&amp;rsquo;s. Even Bob is starting to fire back. Makes the town council &amp;lsquo;main plot&amp;rsquo; amusing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still a very quick watch. Onward to season 3.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Schitt's Creek: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/24/schitts-creek-season-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/24/schitts-creek-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/schitts-creek-season-1.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Tonally&amp;hellip; &lt;em>very&lt;/em> different from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/18/mr.-robot-season-4/">Mr. Robot&lt;/a>. Bit of whiplash from that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, a rich family loses everything&amp;hellip; but the town they bought for a joke (see? rich). Now they have to go live there, with the overblown locals. A whole new way of life to learn and all the hilarious complications that come from that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not the kind of show that I usually like, since it&amp;rsquo;s just so &amp;hellip; cringey/awkward. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to watch people lose everything and just seem so &amp;hellip; bad at being human. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know anyone in that income bracket or especially anyone that&amp;rsquo;s lost so much. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it any easier to believe. They&amp;rsquo;re each quick watches at around 20 minutes though. That&amp;rsquo;s something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, there are a number of really funny moments in there. David is great, Stevie is great. Johnny&amp;ndash;I can&amp;rsquo;t get American Pie out of my head. Alexis and especially Moira aren&amp;rsquo;t great, but so it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth giving a few episodes a try. It gets better throughout the season.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Arcane</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/23/arcane/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/23/arcane/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/arcane.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>That is an absolutely beautiful delight of a show. I love the asthetic/worldbuilding, with a mix of steampunk/magic plus a major cyberpunk visual style. It&amp;rsquo;s something that I really could do with some more of and the animated style &lt;em>really&lt;/em> lends itself nicely to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, there&amp;rsquo;s a mix of a few different plots (family troubles, class war, magic versus tech, corruption in politics / power corrupts) that each work by themselves, but are particularly good when you get crossovers. Class war and politics complicated by magic versus tech. (Found and blood) family troubles through it all. Good times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the worst part of it all? It ended! And now I have to wait for Season 2!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well worth a watch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mr. Robot: Season 4</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/18/mr.-robot-season-4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/18/mr.-robot-season-4/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/mr.robot-season-4.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Wow. That really went quite a fascinating direction. I was wondering where they were going for the last few seasons, but really digging into the aftermath of the season 1 hacks + another big target + dealing with the fallout of the Dark Army + digging deeper into Elliot&amp;rsquo;s troubles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man. Quite a season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had my doubts in the run up to the final few episodes, but I think they really stuck the landing. This was quite a show, through and through. Well worth the watch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/17/harry-potter-20th-anniversary-return-to-hogwarts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/17/harry-potter-20th-anniversary-return-to-hogwarts/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/movies/harry-potter-20th-anniversary-return-to-hogwarts.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>You know&amp;hellip; I should really re-watch those movies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I expect is the case for many in roughly my age bracket, Harry Potter was a huge part of my life growing up. I think I got into it with the release of the 3rd or 4th book (can&amp;rsquo;t quite remember) and absolutely devoured each book after that the night it came out. I watched all of the movies a number of times. It was absolutely fascinating watching the characters in this other world basically growing up with me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now&amp;hellip; 20 years later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/15/star-wars-episode-ix-the-rise-of-skywalker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/15/star-wars-episode-ix-the-rise-of-skywalker/</guid><description>Given the internet&amp;rsquo;s backlast, I exepcted a lot worse. At least to me, The Rise of Skywalker did a pretty decent job of closing the loop on the saga that began a long time ago with the rise of Palpatine and the fall of Anakin Skywalker. Really, that&amp;rsquo;s the entire story, and you get that here in spades.

It&amp;rsquo;s the Nativity story told from the point of view of various animals, voiced by a few famous people (Kris Kristofferson as &amp;lsquo;Old Donkey&amp;rsquo; was pretty awesome&amp;hellip; also Oprah apparently?).

That was a year. Covid, take 2. A new job. A new baby. I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite make my 200 books this year (I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite even make it to 1/2 days), but that&amp;rsquo;s okay. I still read a giant pile. :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some stats:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>179 books read: 1 every 2.04 days (almost!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>47,236 pages read: roughly 130 pages/day&lt;/li>
&lt;li>29 audiobooks, 96 graphic novels, 18 children&amp;rsquo;s chapter books, 18 non-fiction&lt;/li>
&lt;li>56 unique authors (top were Hajime Isayama, Patricia Briggs, Warren Ellis, and Neil Gaiman)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>19 series (top were Attack on Titan, Mercy Thompson/Alpha &amp;amp; Omega, Sandman, and Runelords)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Shortest: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/21/the-shepherds-tale/">The Shepherd&amp;#39;s Tale&lt;/a> with 56 pages, longest: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/the-holy-bible-revised-standard-version-catholic-edition/">The Holy Bible: Revised Standard Version, Catholic Edition&lt;/a> with over 1000. That feels like cheating though, so let&amp;rsquo;s go with &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/21/rhythm-of-war/">Rhythm of War&lt;/a> at 1270 / &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/12/crafting-interpreters/">Crafting Interpreters&lt;/a> at 865. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most read book I read this year was &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/23/1984/">1984&lt;/a> with 5 million others reading it (on Goodreads alone; I was working on my earliest backlog). Least popular: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/26/tales-of-nezura-book-1-the-zevolra/">Tales of Nezura: Book 1: The Zevolra&lt;/a> with only 39. It &amp;hellip; wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad. Give it a try?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I gave 119 five-star ratings, 45 four-star, 7 three-star, and less than 10 other ratings. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the realization over the last year that I tend to like just about everything. Books in particular, they&amp;rsquo;re only on my list if I think I&amp;rsquo;d find them interesting, so of course, they&amp;rsquo;ll be rated highly&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not bad.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 9: Critical Mass</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/hellblazer-vol.-9-critical-mass/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/hellblazer-vol.-9-critical-mass/</guid><description>Two big stories, a few really trippy dreams, and Constantine managing to push off damnation a bit longer.

I did however, read the entire Bible this year (for the second time, first time with the additional Catholic books). This time around, guided by the excellent Bible in a Year podcast hosted by Fr. Mike Schmitz.
Over the course of the year, it goes through every single book in the Bible in a fairly well thought out order&amp;ndash;which certainly does make you realize just how much more of the Old Testament there is&amp;hellip; (For context, the OT is 3x as long as the NT.</description></item><item><title>The Matrix Resurrections</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/30/the-matrix-resurrections/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 00:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/30/the-matrix-resurrections/</guid><description>Whoa.
Well that&amp;rsquo;s a blast of nostalgia, a bunch of mind-bending meta universe building, some awesome new characters, a few solid action scenes, and overall quite an action movie. I loved it.
It&amp;rsquo;s been more than 20 years. I have seen the original Matrix more times than I can easily remember and loved both sequels (even if they didn&amp;rsquo;t shine quite as bright). When they said they were making another one&amp;hellip; I had no idea how in the world they were going to make that possibly work.</description></item><item><title>Spider-Man: Far From Home</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/30/spider-man-far-from-home/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/30/spider-man-far-from-home/</guid><description>As much as I loved Spider-Man: Homecoming, Spider-Man: Far From Home takes what made it great and turns it up a few levels even further.
One one level, you have Spider-Man being Spider-Man. He&amp;rsquo;s a good kid, trying to make his way in life, trying to deal with the dual life of being a highschooler and being a superhero&amp;ndash;of saving the world and perhaps getting the girl.
And then you layer all the weight of the greater MCU on top of it.</description></item><item><title>Clap When You Land</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/29/clap-when-you-land/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/29/clap-when-you-land/</guid><description>I was raised so damn Dominican Spanish my first language bachata a reminder of the power of my body plánto &amp;amp; salami for years before I ever tasted peanut butter &amp;amp; jelly sandwhicches.

It&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird seeing him introduced after the events of Captain America: Civil War and completely skipping how he became Spider-Man in the first place&amp;hellip; but it works. I really like the entire plot, dealing with the fallout of the Avengers / super-hero activity and how normal people try to live their lives around it&amp;ndash;and what happens when the powers that be step in and take that away from them.</description></item><item><title>The Wheel of Time: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/23/the-wheel-of-time-season-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/23/the-wheel-of-time-season-1/</guid><description>The Wheel of Time turns, and ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of time.</description></item><item><title>Hawkeye</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/22/hawkeye/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/22/hawkeye/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/hawkeye.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed Hawkeye.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;em>fun&lt;/em>, which compared to &lt;em>Wandvision&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Loki&lt;/em> and really even &lt;em>What If&amp;hellip;&lt;/em> is a worthwhile goal and really does a lot to show off the more human scale of superheroes. It&amp;rsquo;s never really made much sense that Hawkeye and Black Widow were Avengers&amp;hellip; and it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t. But they do it anyways. Because what Heroes do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see them building up the new &amp;lsquo;Young Avengers&amp;rsquo; and branching out as much as they are. I think Hailee Steinfeld did a great job, especially when acting against &lt;span class="spoiler">Florence Pugh's Yelena&lt;/span>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Greatest Showman</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/21/the-greatest-showman/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/21/the-greatest-showman/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/movies/the-greatest-showman.jpg"/>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Now that&amp;rsquo;s music. I can only imagine hearing that on a theater scale sound system. Although my home sound bar certainly tried it&amp;rsquo;s best&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, I know I&amp;rsquo;m behind the times. Better late than never?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a solid movie that tries to make some big points about everyone having value / sticking it to the people that hate you because you&amp;rsquo;re different and&amp;hellip; mostly hitting the mark? It gets even more complicated when you read up on Barnum&amp;rsquo;s actual history. Very much a serial &amp;lsquo;get rich quick&amp;rsquo;er with some questionable ethics, but there&amp;rsquo;s good parts there as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mr. Robot: Season 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/20/mr.-robot-season-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/20/mr.-robot-season-3/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/mr.robot-season-3.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Oh boy. This one really dug into the darker parts of character growth. Elliot finds new ways to be even crazier, Angela is&amp;hellip; off the rails entirely, Moustache Guy (Bobby Cannavale/Irvin) is awesome, and the entire plot of Darlene, Dominque, and the FBI was fascinating to watch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I keep being pleasantly surprised with where this show keeps going. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have expected them to make it past the first season plotwise&amp;hellip; yet here we are. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to where we can go from here!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/19/star-wars-episode-vi-return-of-the-jedi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/19/star-wars-episode-vi-return-of-the-jedi/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/movies/star-wars-episode-vi---return-of-the-jedi.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>You know, that is a really solid movie. I know a lot of people prefer Empire, but for whatever reason, I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked Return of the Jedi more. That holds true even more, although I have to say that there are a few (possibly nostalgia fueled) particulars that I like more before the special editions changed things.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Worldbinder</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/14/worldbinder/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 00:00:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/14/worldbinder/</guid><description>Where Sons of the Oak could arguably considered a continuation of the first four books, what with references and plots revolving around the Earth King and his wife and a focus on Borenson, Myrrima, and their children, now in Worldbinder we&amp;rsquo;re really getting into the changes&amp;ndash;and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m okay with that.
For one, the first real &amp;lsquo;binding of worlds&amp;rsquo; happens fairly early in the book. In a nutshell, that means that any character alive in both worlds is now a mix of memories, experiences, et al of both characters, while those only in one are initially weaker for it.</description></item><item><title>Pippi in the South Seas</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/12/pippi-in-the-south-seas/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/12/pippi-in-the-south-seas/</guid><description>Cute enough. For the most part, it&amp;rsquo;s more Pippi stories, but they do finally get out of the town and go with Pippi and her father to the South Seas island where her father is king. Which&amp;hellip; is both the best and worst part of the book. It&amp;rsquo;s zany and fun in true Pippi fashion, but it&amp;rsquo;s also horribly imperialistic/racist. It&amp;rsquo;s still a fun book, but definitely a product of the times.</description></item><item><title>Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/11/star-wars-episode-v-the-empire-strikes-back/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/11/star-wars-episode-v-the-empire-strikes-back/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/movies/star-wars-episode-v---the-empire-strikes-back.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Woo! Big icy battles on land in and the sky/space around Hoth, training with a real (short) Jedi Master (and they&amp;rsquo;re all supposed to be dead), meetings between old friends&amp;ndash;who may not be too thrilled about losing in cards all those years ago&amp;ndash;another confrontation between Luke and Vadar, and the big bad reveal. Which&amp;hellip; seriously. His name is literally &lt;span class="spoiler">Dark Father&lt;/span>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a truly bizarre adaptation of the Nutcracker. Or I suppose all of the other versions are bizarre, given that this is supposed to be as &amp;lsquo;close as possible&amp;rsquo; to the original Maurice Sendak version.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 8: Rake at the Gates of Hell</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/09/hellblazer-vol.-8-rake-at-the-gates-of-hell/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/09/hellblazer-vol.-8-rake-at-the-gates-of-hell/</guid><description>There was a lot of potential in this episode, with two longer storylines&amp;ndash;one the continuation of the angels/devil storyline we&amp;rsquo;ve been dealing with for a while. But unfortunately, outside of a few very cool/trippy visuals it was a surprisingly quiet volume. A lot of human trouble, not enough supernatural craziness. Less moping at least, but without a real transition (at least in my opinion). Not terrible, but certainly one of the weaker entries in the series.</description></item><item><title>An Alchemy of Masques and Mirrors</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/08/an-alchemy-of-masques-and-mirrors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/08/an-alchemy-of-masques-and-mirrors/</guid><description>Well that was delightful. One of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;m really glad for the 2021 Book Bingo. I don&amp;rsquo;t know when/if I would have found this book, if not for that, and I really quite enjoyed it. It&amp;rsquo;s got great steampunky worldbuilding (with some hints of body horror I honestly feel steampunk should probably have more of), royal/courtly intrigue, wonderful characters, and some delightful writing (with a French twist to the word choices that I don&amp;rsquo;t see much of).</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 7: Tainted Love</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/07/hellblazer-vol.-7-tainted-love/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/07/hellblazer-vol.-7-tainted-love/</guid><description>Another solid volume. In particular, there&amp;rsquo;s another volume about angels/demons/and the troubles they get into. It&amp;rsquo;s not quite as good as the one in Bloodlines, but still enjoyable. An interesting take on Gabriel, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure.

And not only because they got Patrick Stewart of all people to voice Bambi&amp;rsquo;s dad (who now has to step up and be a single father). It&amp;rsquo;s as cute a story as Bambi was&amp;ndash;which the kids' appreciated&amp;ndash;but with just a bit more depth&amp;ndash;which I did. It&amp;rsquo;s still certainly not high cinema, but it&amp;rsquo;s not terrible either.

A couple of great longer storylines with long term consequences (Guys &amp;amp; Dolls was great) and a few shorter one offs (Lord of the Dance in particular I enjoyed). Could have been longer, but there’s still potentially more story to be told there.
