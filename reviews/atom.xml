&lt;p>A huge step up from Volume 3.

I already missed Luci and now barely any Laura, just flashbacks. I keep expecting the Gods to do the God thing and be no-longer-dead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We do get some neat backstory and introductions though!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/20/alices-adventures-in-wonderland/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/20/alices-adventures-in-wonderland/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How puzzling all these changes are! I&amp;rsquo;m never sure what I&amp;rsquo;m going to be, from one minute to another.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a weird book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ve read it before and I know I&amp;rsquo;ve at least seen the Disney version, but apparently I haven&amp;rsquo;t reviewed it, so here we go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a weird book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Wicked + The Divine, Vol. 2: Fandemonium</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/20/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-2-fandemonium/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/20/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-2-fandemonium/</guid><description>&lt;p>A fiery start and an even more bonkers escalation. I love the idea behind the worlds so much, especially as we learn more. The art is fantastic, especially that party scene. Pages and pages odd of colors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Wicked + The Divine, Vol. 1: The Faust Act</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/17/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-1-the-faust-act/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/17/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-1-the-faust-act/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful start.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Radical Act of Free Magic</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/10/a-radical-act-of-free-magic/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/10/a-radical-act-of-free-magic/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>A Radical Act of Free Magic&lt;/em> takes place right where &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/">A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians&lt;/a> leaves off. The French Revolution is well underway, Britain might very well be next, slaves are revolting, and there&amp;rsquo;s this mysterious shadow operating behind the scenes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add to that: Napoleon! Even more magic! Magical beasties a la &lt;span class="spoiler">a kraken and a dragon!&lt;/span>

&lt;p>No one ever has the right to take the life of another.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But perhaps, sometimes, you do have the responsibility to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that&amp;hellip; was certainly a show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an absolutely fascinating combination of weird anime sci-fi and more than a touch of weird western. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a few memorable characters (some perhaps&amp;hellip; too memorable), some weirdly wonderful worldbuilding and setting moments, and all sorts of gunfights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I can really recommend it. It started out weird, took a while to make any particular sense, and just when I felt it was getting there&amp;hellip; it ended. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly interesting, I&amp;rsquo;ll give it that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few question I still have after the show (spoilers):&lt;/p>
&lt;span class="spoiler">Where in the world did the names Vash and Millions Knives even come from? They're so different.&lt;/span>
&lt;p>And:&lt;/p>
&lt;span class="spoiler">Who (or what) were the Gung-Ho Guns? Literal demons? Natives? Weird humanity? What's with the vastly differently sized people.&lt;/span></description></item><item><title>Foundryside</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/06/foundryside/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/06/foundryside/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Every innovation—technological, sociological, or otherwise—begins as a crusade, organizes itself into a practical business, and then, over time, degrades into common exploitation. This is simply the life cycle of how human ingenuity manifests in the material world. What goes forgotten, though, is that those who partake in this system undergo a similar transformation: people begin as comrades and fellow citizens, then become labor resources and assets, and then, as their utility shifts or degrades, transmute into liabilities, and thus must be appropriately managed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that was delightful. It&amp;rsquo;s been on my list for a while, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give it a chance and I&amp;rsquo;m so very glad I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I highly recommend the book, with the disclaimer that there are some dark scenes, bits (sorry) of body horror, and quite a lot of (made up fantasy) swearing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Lost Metal</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/27/the-lost-metal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/27/the-lost-metal/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mate, it ain&amp;rsquo;t violence if it&amp;rsquo;s religion.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so it ends. The second era of one of the more ambitious ideas in fantasy: take a fantasy world with a hard/scientific magic system (or three), tell a crazy story in that world, and then advance a few hundred years so that the first story becomes the myths and religions of the world. Not only that, but (specifically in the Lost Metal), take that same idea and expand it across a shared universe of fantasy worlds, each with their own feel and magic and start really bringing things in from other worlds, mashing them together and seeing just what sort of madness pops out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/12/snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/12/snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs/</guid><description>&lt;p>An almost 100 year old movie, based on a story likely at least a century older, combining aspects of stories who knows how old, animated for the modern (of the time) movie going audience. It&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of a truely delightful era&amp;ndash;that of the Disney animated classics. While they&amp;rsquo;ve certainly got their problems (the rather traditional gender roles and Disney&amp;rsquo;s ongoing copyright battles to name a pair), they&amp;rsquo;re still something elegant and innocent about them and Snow White is no exception.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 11: Apocalypse</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/12/the-unwritten-vol.-11-apocalypse/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/12/the-unwritten-vol.-11-apocalypse/</guid><description>&lt;p>It all comes together in the end. Pullman. Madame Puppeteer. Tom and Tommy. Savoy, Wilson, Lizzie. The Rabbit. Everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course, for the biggest story: the Grail (and the other stories based on it and based upon it). Or is it a drum? A trumpet? The Trumpet?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And&amp;hellip; the End.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/unwritten-11-6820cf.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/unwritten-11-8fd281.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a weird conclusion to a weird story. Fitting that way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth the read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 10: War Stories</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/06/the-unwritten-vol.-10-war-stories/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/06/the-unwritten-vol.-10-war-stories/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the beginning&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/unwritten-10-ef6c92.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it only gets weirder from there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/unwritten-10-381f87.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good choice of story though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/unwritten-10-01d658.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yup. That&amp;rsquo;s Aslan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course it&amp;rsquo;s going to take quite a story to get back to the &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; world from Fables&amp;hellip; But in a good way. I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see a few older characters and more Levithan. Feels like things are really finishing off.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nettle &amp; Bone</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/01/nettle-bone/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/01/nettle-bone/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The trees were full of crows and the woods were full of madmen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pit was full of bones and her hands were full of wires.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that was a delightful surprise&amp;ndash;in a dark fairytale kind of way. I&amp;rsquo;ve not read any T. Kingfisher before, but I&amp;rsquo;ll have to remedy that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, Nettle &amp;amp; Bone takes the idea of a fairy godmother&amp;rsquo;s blessing at birth and twists it, bringing in the politics of unequal neighboring kingdoms; fae, their bargains, and all the twists that go with that; and a touch of demons and death magic. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun world to build a foundation on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, it&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful cast of characters. I love seeing Marra, third-born princess, sent to a religious order (sort of), and originally on her own to solve the world&amp;rsquo;s problems. Only for her to collect a motley band of strange and wonderful allies, each in their own ways: a witch, a reluctant godmother, a night, a dog made of bones, and a demon made of chicken. (It makes sense). They&amp;rsquo;re all great and I love the found family dynamic as they&amp;rsquo;re off to save the world&amp;ndash;or at least some tiny corner of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As if that weren&amp;rsquo;t enough, I love the prose and wordplay. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>written&lt;/em> like a fairytale writ large. It just fits the story so well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, One of the best books I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year and more than worth giving it a try.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 9: The Unwritten Fables</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/24/the-unwritten-vol.-9-the-unwritten-fables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/24/the-unwritten-vol.-9-the-unwritten-fables/</guid><description>&lt;p>Wait&amp;hellip; &lt;em>that&lt;/em> Fables. Confused for a bit. Those people all sounded familiar&amp;hellip; but not from Unwritten.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/unwritten-9-8c2e37.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not at all what I expected, but most appreciated. It&amp;rsquo;s great to see a number of old faces again, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I read Fables. They fit together about as strangely as you&amp;rsquo;d imagine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s fascinating bit of historical fantasy. Take revolutionary era France, introduce various relatively &amp;lsquo;common&amp;rsquo; classes of magicians (fire, water, weather, mind control, etc), and see what shakes out. It&amp;rsquo;s an era of history I&amp;rsquo;m probably not as familiar with as I should be and, while with the introduction of magic things are slightly different, the events actually shake out more or less the same way (as I looked up later). It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to read about people such as William Pitt and Maximilien Robespierre &amp;hellip; and then read about them again in real history.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Call of the Bone Ships</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/call-of-the-bone-ships/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/call-of-the-bone-ships/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/03/the-bone-ships/">The Bone Ships&lt;/a>&lt;/em> introduced us to the world&amp;ndash;where the bones of gigantic sea dragons once provided the building materials for ships, with hints of something even darker and more interesting going on in the background.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Call of the Bones Ships&lt;/em> takes up that up another level, really digging more into the often twisted politics and future of the world. It manages to give us quite a bit more insight into Joron Twiner, who is forced rather handedly to come into his own&amp;ndash;with whatever that ends up meaning&amp;ndash;and torturing him rather much along the way. We also get a lot of more of the gullaime (and the Gullaime specifically). There&amp;rsquo;s still a lot more to unpack there, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking for the third.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It ends up being rather a darker book, which fits even better as the successor to the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, wonderful worldbuilding, a darker tone, fascinating characters, and worth the re-read. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 8: Orpheus in the Underworld</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/22/the-unwritten-vol.-8-orpheus-in-the-underworld/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/22/the-unwritten-vol.-8-orpheus-in-the-underworld/</guid><description>&lt;p>A journey to Hell&amp;hellip; and a few faces we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in a while.

At times, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s going on, which makes me feel bad for the characters. :D It&amp;rsquo;s still a wonderful fever top of a story though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>She-Hulk: Attorney at Law</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/14/she-hulk-attorney-at-law/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/14/she-hulk-attorney-at-law/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not easy being green.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a strange one. She&amp;rsquo;s the Hulk&amp;rsquo;s cousin. One things lead to another, and she gets all Hulked out&amp;hellip; but without any of the downsides?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The contrast between being a Hulk and being a lawyer (and being a big green lawyer) is pretty cool, Tatiana Maslany does a wonderful job in the titular role, and it was great fun to see Tim Roth&amp;rsquo;s Abomination again, not to mention Charlie Cox&amp;rsquo;s Daredevil. Fun casting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s a really weird show. And they&amp;rsquo;re rather solidly into the whoe 4th wall breaking thing, which is kind of amusing. Weird. But amusing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I enjoyed the show. Not my favorite of the MCU TV shows, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have watched it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Boys: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/09/the-boys-season-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/09/the-boys-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve previously watched the first season and read the comics, but with season 3 out now (and I haven’t reviewed the show previously), let’s watch it again. Should be interesting seeing what’s different this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wow that&amp;rsquo;s violent. Just as bad if not worse than the comics, since you get to see it all on screen. But in a way that actually has some solid visuals and crazy scenes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Up</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/08/up/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/08/up/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whelp. That&amp;rsquo;s one major tear jerker of an intro. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even need words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest of the movie is a pretty fun romp of an adventure as well. The old man, too old for this crap / young boy just trying so very hard to do the right thing is great; the talking collars and how dogs think is hilarious; and the adventurey bits are solid and almost too exciting (depending on the age of the viewers).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A solid Pixar, well worth watching.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Free Guy</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/07/free-guy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/07/free-guy/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Guy: I know this world is just a game, but this place, these people, that&amp;rsquo;s all I have. So I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna be the good guy. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be a great guy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Molotov Girl: [inhales] Wow, enjoy your lifetime supply of virginity.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds playing a guy named Guy in a game&amp;ndash;but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t realize it. It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a lot of fun. Once you get the basic idea, you&amp;rsquo;ve got pretty much the entire plot, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun and well done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/movies/attachments/free-guy-62ba5c.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a watch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Starless Sea</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-starless-sea/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-starless-sea/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Far beneath the surface of the earth, hidden from the sun and the moon, upon the shores of the Starless Sea, there is a labyrinthine collection of tunnels and rooms filled with stories. Stories written in books and sealed in jars and painted on walls. Odes inscribed onto skin and pressed into rose petals. Tales laid in tiles upon the floors, bits of plot worn away by passing feet. Legends carved in crystal and hung from chandeliers. Stories catalogued and cared for and revered. Old stories preserved while new stories spring up around them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The Starless Sea&lt;/em> is an unfortunate sort of book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, the prose is beautiful. There are some really wonderful passages and smaller stories that really sing on the pages. On top of that, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of delightful visuals described from the book. Often times, I don&amp;rsquo;t really picture what&amp;rsquo;s going on in a lot of stories, I more&amp;hellip; absorb them. But this, this really needs and thrives on the visuals. Especially leaning on the sights and smells of books and libraries and doors, it&amp;rsquo;s the sort of book a physical book lover (not a lover of stories, one of the actual physical books themselves) could really get into.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand&amp;hellip; even after reading through the entire book, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what in the world was going on / what the point of anything was. A book doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to have a point&amp;ndash;I do love a good slice of life story&amp;ndash;but this felt like it was trying to go for something. But with the absolute pile of characters (major, minor, versions of the same) jumping around all the time, it was hard to figure anything out. The prose and settings almost do enough to overcome that&amp;hellip; but not quite enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s a book that was almost really really good&amp;hellip; but didn&amp;rsquo;t quite stick the landing for me. It&amp;rsquo;s probably worth a try, but if you bounce off the first few chapters, consider that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really change that much before the end.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 6: Tommy Taylor and the War of Words</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-unwritten-vol.-6-tommy-taylor-and-the-war-of-words/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-unwritten-vol.-6-tommy-taylor-and-the-war-of-words/</guid><description>&lt;p>The story is going now.

&lt;p>Saints become martyrs before they get to be heroes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure what to expect. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t actually read the books (although now I really wanted to) and for the first episode or two, I really thought it was some sort of cheesy YA fantasy, a la Hunger Games and the ilk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But a few episodes in&amp;hellip; and it really started to grow on me. The world building is fascinating, primarily the basis on a broad Asian setting, but with an emphasis on Russian roots, with some influences (in other nations) from China and India. The magic system is a bit cheesey and somewhat unexplained (so far), but at the very least it&amp;rsquo;s pretty?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, you have absolutely wonderful characters/actors. Jessie Mei Li nails it as lead Alina Starkov, Ben Barnes as General Kirigan&amp;ndash;plays his character rather well (&lt;span class="spoiler">he actually has the gravitas of old, powerful, and twisted, which not everyone can pull off&lt;/span>
). But the ones that really shine are the Crows (I don&amp;rsquo;t think they&amp;rsquo;re referred to as such in the show?): Freddy Carter as Kaz, Amita Suman as Inej and Kit Young as Jesper. There are rumors that they might get their own show and that would be &lt;strong>awesome&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, worth a watch. And we&amp;rsquo;re getting Season 2, hopefully sometime next year? Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Soul Taken</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/05/soul-taken/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/05/soul-taken/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This frail cloth, a gift to the person he had once been, was his touchstone, a reminder that once he had been whole. Once there had been joy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a crazy book for backstory. We get more backstory of Wulfe and Sherwood (big answers there), a bit more about Zee (he&amp;rsquo;s terrifying, but still a good guy), and even more escalations / variations on what it means that Mercy&amp;rsquo;s Coyote-magic is based around boundaries and death. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting variation, a complicated book, and well worth reading.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars: Visions</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/05/star-wars-visions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/05/star-wars-visions/</guid><description>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating expirment. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure who got that made, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad they did. Take Star Wars, give it to a bunch of different Japanese (or Japanese inspired) animators, and make sure that nothing in this will be canon (so you can tell all sorts of stories). There aren&amp;rsquo;t any particularly deep, they&amp;rsquo;re too short for that. But beautiful, oh this series has that in spades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a watch!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Bone Ships</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/03/the-bone-ships/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/03/the-bone-ships/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating bit of worldbuilding. In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s a world (or at least story) dominated by naval superiority&amp;ndash;brought about by ships built on the literal bones of sea dragons. And what&amp;rsquo;s more, the sea dragons appear to have been hunted to extinction, making the warships all the more rare and valuable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a very cool root for the story and Barker only takes it from there with unique twists on vocab and word choice, a few other interesting bits of magic, and more naval everything than you can shake some paint at.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do quite enjoy the characters as well. Setting the story around a prison ship? Not that unusual, but I really do love how much Barker makes the reader care for the people on it&amp;ndash;and to see them grow together as a grow. Lucky Maes is of course awesome as well&amp;ndash;and I do love the more alien birdman. Want to see what more is going on there for sure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a great book and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have read it. Onward to the sequels!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Canticle for Leibowitz</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/31/a-canticle-for-leibowitz/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/31/a-canticle-for-leibowitz/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But neither infinite power nor infinite wisdom could bestow godhood upon men. For that there would have to be infinite love as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That was an interesting book. In a nutshell, humanity finally managed to blow ourselves up&amp;ndash;and then the story begins. Years after Armageddon, we pick up with a religious order founded to preserve knowledge (a worthwhile goal).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Warning: the rest of this summary contains minor (IMO) spoilers on the structure of the book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 4: Leviathan</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/29/the-unwritten-vol.-4-leviathan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/29/the-unwritten-vol.-4-leviathan/</guid><description>&lt;p>Onward marches the story, ever stranger.

&lt;p>On one hand, we do get a bit of backstory with parent issues (oh so many parent issues), the rest of the zodiac (more or less), and some answers about Akito.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, there are piles of weird age issues (I know this is apparently an anime staple; that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it better) and episode after episode dedicated to &amp;hellip; the student council of all things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We made it through 15 episodes of this season. Fin.

&lt;p>Well that was a delightfully &lt;em>weird&lt;/em> movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If anything at all of that sounds interesting (especially the &lt;em>weird&lt;/em> part) and you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen this movie yet, go see it. Don&amp;rsquo;t spoil it.

Between the two, they&amp;rsquo;re either my top or second favorite urban fantasy series out there (the other being the Dresden Files) and I&amp;rsquo;ve reread each a number of times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around though, I decided to hit all of the short stories and novellas as well, primarily collected in &lt;em>Shifting Shadows&lt;/em>. Rather than one post per book, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to put them all in this one post, ordered chronologically within the Mercyverse. Any I haven&amp;rsquo;t read yet, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave as placeholders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good stories all and none seem critical for enjoying the main series if you skip over them. A bit more backstory, particularly for more minor characters though, which is appreciated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll try for minor spoilers at most, but I&amp;rsquo;m not always the most caring about that. :D&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Land Before Time</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/13/the-land-before-time/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/13/the-land-before-time/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually watched any of the &lt;em>Land Before Time&lt;/em> movie.

Getting better all the time, so &amp;hellip; what about &lt;em>Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good question. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to love about the movie: Hemsworth&amp;rsquo;s sense of humor, Portman back and then some, Thompson&amp;rsquo;s awesome and slightly awkward Valkyrie. And of course Bale plays a solidly terrifying baddy in Gorr.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, there is a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of movie to get through here, probably more than a bit too much. A cancer plot, succession jealousy, a threat spanning across the Galaxy (or at least the gods thereof)&amp;ndash;heck, the idea that gods are just &lt;em>a thing&lt;/em> now, Thor unpacking even more trauma. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot to put into a single movie and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>quite&lt;/em> work. It&amp;rsquo;s still a solid enough flick, but not nearly up to what &lt;em>Ragnarok&lt;/em> did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, pretty impressive for the first 4th solo outing in the MCU. Because that&amp;rsquo;s a thing we can say now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/29/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/29/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness/</guid><description>&lt;p>So.

Ancient aliens sent to Earth thousands of years ago to protect1 humanity&amp;hellip; but only from very specific threats. Loki and the Chitauri? Nah. Hydra? Nope. Thanos? Of course not. A whole cast of superheroes2 and we&amp;rsquo;ve never seen them before3&amp;ndash;and I doubt that any of the should-be-worldwide-news events in this film will make it into any of the others.
If you ignore all that though, it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting enough idea, especially once you start digging into the greater cosmic plot.</description></item><item><title>Ms. Marvel</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/23/ms.-marvel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/23/ms.-marvel/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ms. Marvel is not particularly earth-shattering. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t deal with the end of the world and only barely with the greater MCU (although there is a decent bit of &amp;lsquo;how the world changes with superheroes in it, like Ant-Man&amp;rsquo;s podcast and Avengercon).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What it is though? A awful lot of fun. Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan is just an absolute delight and really looks like she had a great time in the role. The whole supporting cast is great as well, especially Kamala&amp;rsquo;s family and friends Bruno and Nakia.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Kamala Khan: [whispers] I&amp;rsquo;m a super hero.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[She runs off gleefully]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed this. Especially when it leaned into the Muslim + Pakistani culture and the family dynamics of the whole thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sheikh Abdullah: I don’t need anyone on my side. I’m not even concerned if God is on my side as long as I am on His side. God is always right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Agent Deever: I don’t have time for Quranic quotes. Excuse me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sheikh Abdullah: Actually, that was Abraham Lincoln.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The big fights and greater threats were kind of cheesey and didn&amp;rsquo;t mesh as well (especially the big showpiece in the final episode), but the down to earth human parts of being a teenager superhero? Awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s so hard to rank these any more, since there&amp;rsquo;s just so much to love in the MCU. I think Ms. Marvel ends up pretty squarely in the middle of the pack&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;d still say it&amp;rsquo;s worth a watch. Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Last Argument of Kings</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/17/last-argument-of-kings/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/17/last-argument-of-kings/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I have learned all kinds of things from my many mistakes. The one thing I never learn is to stop making them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so it ends&amp;hellip; for now. Some of our old friends (more or less) are dead, some are broken, and some &amp;hellip; miraculously seem to have gotten everything they wanted in life. There are more surprises and political shifts than one knows how to deal with, a chunk more of world building around the First and Second Laws, and all manner of battles and death and destruction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It remains fascinating what Abercrombie can do with characters. Glokta is a terrible person&amp;ndash;and he makes us root for him. Logen is a berserker in the truest sense&amp;ndash;and he makes us feel sorry for him. Jezal is excellent at failing upward&amp;ndash;and he makes us feel sorry for him. It&amp;rsquo;s all around amazing and the real strength of the series.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Underworld: Evolution</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/17/underworld-evolution/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/17/underworld-evolution/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quite an interesting contrast compared to the first &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/15/underworld/">Underworld&lt;/a>. Where the first was a straight forward vampire/werewolf urban fantasy action flick, Evolution tries to be more.

&lt;p>People – a group comprised of every sapient species, organic or otherwise – were chaos, but chaos was good. Chaos was the only sensible conclusion. There was no law that was just in every situation, no blanket rule that could apply to everyone, no explanation that accounted for every component. This did not mean that laws and rules were not helpful, or that explanations should not be sought, but rather that there should be no fear in changing them as needed, for nothing in the universe ever held still.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh, I do love these books. Especially on audio. There just such a delightful take on the sci-fi &amp;lsquo;slice of life&amp;rsquo; genre. Once again, it&amp;rsquo;s a new cast and new stories, with loose tiebacks to the previous characters (seeing Pei and hearing her talk about Ashby is a nice change of view). Chambers really shines at taking a bunch of weird and wonderful aliens, sticking them in a tight space (this time what&amp;rsquo;s essentially a &amp;lsquo;space truck stop&amp;rsquo;) for a few days, and seeing what happens. Nothing earthshaking&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> or deadly&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, but a lot of interpersonal drama.
