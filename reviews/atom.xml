&lt;p>Bit more traditional super hero flare, but still with a Runaways twist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s a big bad in the future and our intrepid heroes(ish) have to find him as a teenager and … deal with him. Because that worked out so well the last two times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus all sorts of b-tier / c-tier hero cameos… I have no idea which of these were made up for this story and which have decades long comics ruins of their own. And some rather higher level villains about. Now that was a surprise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fun ride.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Cloud Roads</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/26/the-cloud-roads/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/26/the-cloud-roads/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a fascinating sort of book, especially having read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-murderbot-diaries/">The Murderbot Diaries&lt;/a> first. It&amp;rsquo;s not entirely the same thing at all&amp;ndash;fantasy rather than science fiction, with a world full of floating eyes and many different sapient races rather than aliens and murderbots&amp;ndash;but there are some bones that aren&amp;rsquo;t too dissimilar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, you have Moon. He&amp;rsquo;s a Raksura, a being capable of transforming between a more or less human form (although I don&amp;rsquo;t get the feeling there are any real &amp;lsquo;humans&amp;rsquo; in this book) and a much larger stronger winged form. He&amp;rsquo;s all on his own, not even sure what he is&amp;ndash;or where he fits in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which of course goes badly when the people he&amp;rsquo;s staying with think he&amp;rsquo;s Fell (winged &amp;rsquo;evil&amp;rsquo; creatures; I&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that). And much better when another Raksura finds him and brings him back. And worse again when it turns out they don&amp;rsquo;t want him either. And better again when, of course, he saves the day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Evershore</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/25/evershore/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/25/evershore/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Like the Saint says, if you don’t have anything to say, you might scare your flightleader into thinking you’re dead.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The one with Jerkface and the Kitsen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like all of the Starsight novellas, we have a focus on what else has been going on while Spena has been doing her &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/19/cytonic/">Cytonic&lt;/a> things. This time&amp;ndash;as you might guess&amp;ndash;with Jerkface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s actually really great to see his point of view and especially to see just how much he&amp;rsquo;s grown throughout the books. He was always a leader, but he&amp;rsquo;s really coming into it now&amp;ndash;and really realizing that sometimes, just maybe, the books might be &lt;em>wrong&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do also love seeing more of the Kitsen. They&amp;rsquo;re really building up a regular anti-Superiority alliance there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the biggest bummer now is having to wait for Defiant to come out this November&amp;hellip; Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Runaways, Vol. 3: The Good Die Young</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/25/runaways-vol.-3-the-good-die-young/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/25/runaways-vol.-3-the-good-die-young/</guid><description>&lt;p>Finally getting some answers!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/runaways-v3-e7b707.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And what they mean when they say it’s all for the children…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Downton Abbey: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/24/downton-abbey-season-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 23:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/24/downton-abbey-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Somehow I&amp;rsquo;m always surprised when a highly rated show is actually good. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From a modern, American, middle-class point of view, the idea of the early 1900s British Aristocracy is just so strange. They do next nothing (useful) and have an entire staff to support it. The entire estate could go to a cousin they&amp;rsquo;d never met and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing they can do about it &amp;hellip; is so strange.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yet&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s oddly charming?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Grantham&amp;rsquo;s are fascinating. Sybil seems good people, Edith is certainly going to figure out how to come into her own, Mary is spoiled and needlessly cruel&amp;ndash;but may be learning. Lord and Lady Grantham are fun, if somewhat alien&amp;ndash;and I do love watching Lord Grantham try and completely fail to wrangle three young adult daughters. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The shining jewel of the family Dame Maggie Smith&amp;rsquo;s Dowager Countess of Grantham. Oh she&amp;rsquo;s just wonderful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Among the staff, you have a whole &amp;rsquo;nother level of politics. They&amp;rsquo;re all great and terrible (as they should be) and there are every bit as many problems and politics as there are among the &amp;lsquo;family&amp;rsquo;. Turns out people are people no matter how much money they have or do not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man that&amp;rsquo;s a crazy amount to fit into seven episodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward&amp;hellip; to war!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Runaways, Vol. 2: Teenage Wasteland</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/24/runaways-vol.-2-teenage-wasteland/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/24/runaways-vol.-2-teenage-wasteland/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/runaways-v2-505090.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And so the team grows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They’re so amusingly teenager. Angst and boy / girl issues contrasting against their parents trying to find / capture / kill then. Good times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s fun watching them try to grow up fast. I have no idea how they end up getting out of this mess… or what their parents are really up to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which is the best part!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Magical Midlife Madness</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/24/magical-midlife-madness/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/24/magical-midlife-madness/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But the truth was, I didn’t feel accepted. I didn’t feel acknowledged for my service in raising the next generation, for my active role in the community, or even for being human sometimes. I felt utterly ignored. I felt invisible or, worse, frowned upon. Most of the time, when I looked in the mirror, I saw only my flaws. I saw all the things that advertisements and social media said was wrong with me. I wanted to focus on what was right about this version of myself, like the way I’d learned to take life a little slower and enjoy each moment. Like my appreciation for people’s differences, and for beauty found in unlikely places. For my friendships, new and old. I wanted it to be okay that I wasn’t worried about beauty anymore, or worried about looking young. I just wanted to look like me, however me looked in any given year.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Take your normal urban fantasy fair: our world, but with a few twists&amp;ndash;gargoyles for one, this time. Add in your &amp;rsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; point of view about to get their world rocked. This time around make them a 40 year old woman recently gone through a divorce. Make sure that none of this really gets moving until the last third or so of the book (better if you&amp;rsquo;re going to read the whole series I suppose).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Magical Midlife Madness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s fine and I expect there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more to like about the rest of the series, but to me the entire thing just sort of existed. Not that much happened, there was entirely too much wish fulfillment, and too much focus on &amp;lsquo;it&amp;rsquo;s okay to be 40&amp;rsquo; (which it totally is, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, just not chapters and chapters worth).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not a bad book. It&amp;rsquo;s not the kind of book for me. I won&amp;rsquo;t be reading the rest of the series. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Vela</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/22/the-vela/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/22/the-vela/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Eratos wasn’t the only dying world, just the one dying fastest—the tiny colony on Samos had been gone for a decade, and after Eratos would be Hypatia and then Gan-De, and maybe the Inner Ring would finally come to care when it was their turn to freeze to death as the sun collapsed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A leisurely extinction. One that allowed everyone to push any inconvenience to another place or another generation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The Vela is part of a fascinating sort of new/old model: serialized fiction. In this case &lt;a href="https://www.realm.fm/">Realm.fm (formerly Serial Box)&lt;/a> is putting out piles of audio fiction by a number of well known authors chapter by chapter. And yet&amp;hellip; somehow I read the ebook version from the library. I really should check out the audio versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, The worldbuilding (as in the above quote) in the Vela is fascinating. A nearish-future tech sci-fi universe where humanity has managed to extract enough resources from the local star to freeze out the outer planets, wrecking all manner of havoc among the people that live out there. There&amp;rsquo;s all manner of classism, racism, and other racisms to digest&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Set against the backdrop of a missing starship (the Vela) and the two unlikely companions (Asala and Niko) who are sent to go find it. I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see Becky Chambers as one of the authors here, I really love how she does &amp;lsquo;people stories&amp;rsquo;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet read the other three authors, but they&amp;rsquo;re all on my to-read shelf already and higher up now. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The relationship between Asala (hard bitten mercenary/sniper) and Nike (child of the president; hacker) throughout the stories is really the shining jewel of the series. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see the slight (IMO) variations between how the different authors see and write them, but it&amp;rsquo;s still well worth reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well well worth a read. Or a listen. And Season 2 is on Realm? Onward!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>People spoke about the death of planets as if the rock itself would shatter, but the truth was never so dramatic. The entire sphere wasn&amp;rsquo;t in danger of ceasing to exist. All that mattered was the inner goings-on of that tiny strip of gauze, that onion skin of atmosphere clinging to the rocky surface like morning dew. The narrowest of margins on which everything depended.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/runaways-v1-eeae62.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh that’s fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/runaways-v1-569e60.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh that’s even better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s a very promising start to a fascinating story. The kids are fun and I like seeing the mix of teenage dynamics with mysterious new powers and problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No idea what their parents are really up to, but that’s the point, no?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Marvel 1602: Witch Hunter Angela</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/20/marvel-1602-witch-hunter-angela/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 00:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/20/marvel-1602-witch-hunter-angela/</guid><description>&lt;p>The last of the 1602 stories, so far as I know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A truly odd story of two women hunting. I … don’t actually know so they are in the original continuity. So I’m not sure what changes here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Various panels making our clear that the characters are aware of our time and that they aren’t in it… is an odd choice. Related to the above perhaps?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The art changes style from part to part and some of it absolutely gorgeous in a haunting sort of way, other parts oddly surreal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I enjoyed it, if perhaps the least of this run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Marvel 1602: Spider-Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/20/marvel-1602-spider-man/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 00:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/20/marvel-1602-spider-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>It’s straight up Spider-Man, 400 years ago. Octavius, Lizard, Goblin, Fisk. All the villains you’d expect in about to the ways you’d expect them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s enjoyable, but not exactly groundbreaking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My one (strong dislike) is replacing Virginia Dare with Mary Jane Watsonne. So not necessary… a problem with comics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cytonic</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/19/cytonic/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/19/cytonic/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Stories say something. About us, and about where we came from. They’re a reminder that we have a past, a history. And a future.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that was certainly a thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/02/28/skyward/">Skyward&lt;/a> introduced us to some far future humans trapped on a planet by terrifying aliens. Spensa learns how to fight, teachers her friends and allies how to be awesome, and saves the day from the aliens!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/26/starsight/">Starsight&lt;/a>, we get off world. We&amp;rsquo;re introduced us to some of those same aliens. Turns out they&amp;rsquo;re people, more or less just like us. So Spensa learns how to spy, teachers her new friends and allies how to be awesome, and saves the day from the Eldrich Horrors From Beyond Space!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So of course in Cytonic&amp;hellip; Spensa goes Beyond Space. She adventures through all manners of weird environments, meets a bunch of Pirates From Beyond Space&amp;hellip; And learns to fight, teachers her friends and allies how to be awesome, and saves the universe?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m starting to sense a pattern here.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>All people must accept that we have the potential to do terrible things. It is part of seeing our place in the universe, our heritage, and our natures. But in that acceptance we gain strength, for potential can be refused. Any hero who could have been a monster is more heroic for the choices he or she made to walk another road.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/19/marvel-1602-fantastick-four/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/19/marvel-1602-fantastick-four/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Four of the Fantastick. A story I’m more or less familiar with, only from various movies rather than the comics. Here, they’re in the world created by time travel to 1602. Doom wants to travel beyond the edge of the world to heal his face and takes Shakespeare along for the ride.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An interesting enough story. Weird to involve Shakespeare.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Marvel 1602: New World</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/18/marvel-1602-new-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Feb 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/18/marvel-1602-new-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/17/marvel-1602/">Marvel 1602&lt;/a> established a world where time travel managed to accidentally cause various heroes to be born around the year 1602, now in New World we see more fallout if that story. The 1602 Master Spider of course, but also Lord Iron, Master Jameson and his broadsheet, and, of course, the Hulk—who needs no puny time periodic appropriate name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It feels like somewhat smaller a story than the original 1602 and more like we’re reading something that we’ve seen before, just with a new coat of paint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still fun though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Marvel 1602</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/17/marvel-1602/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/17/marvel-1602/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sir Nicholas Fury, with his servant Peter Parquagh. Stephen Strange, master of medicines. A blind man jumping around in the night. Sister Wanda, with her red habit. Witchbreed. So many new takes on old friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh. And dinosaurs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/marvel-1602-8f5230.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As things escalate, it turns out there may very well be a reason everything is out of time… as there always had to be in a comic book. It’s neat when you get there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read. It’s certainly an interesting ride.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hawkeye, Volume 6: Hawkeyes</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/05/hawkeye-volume-6-hawkeyes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2023 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/05/hawkeye-volume-6-hawkeyes/</guid><description>&lt;p>One part now:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/hawkeye-2012-v6-c76564.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One part future:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/hawkeye-2012-v6-fba351.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One part America (Chavez)!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/hawkeye-2012-v6-69e746.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a neat story, finishing up the story of Project Communion from volume 5, digging into how very much baggage both Hawkeyes carry, and really giving their working together a chance to (eventually) shine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>They couldn’t/didn’t get the rights to the third age, so instead we get much older stories. Stories after the fall of Morgoth but still during the end of the era of Elves and Númenor. Before the rise of the kingdoms of Men.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s a lot crammed into eight episodes. One might argue too much. Leaves some stories a bit thin. But really, having seen them, I don’t know what I’d cut.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a watch. Looking forward to season two!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hawkeye, Volume 5: All-New Hawkeye</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/04/hawkeye-volume-5-all-new-hawkeye/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/04/hawkeye-volume-5-all-new-hawkeye/</guid><description>&lt;p>Project Communion&amp;ndash;whatever that is. The implication that S.H.I.E.L.D. isn’t really much better than H.Y.D.R.A. sometimes. Hawkeyes!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a solid mostly self contained adventure. I enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not a huge fan of the pastel flashbacks. Hard to read at best. The story is neat—origin story!—but I want to skip it just because of the style.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ReDawn</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/04/redawn/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/04/redawn/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A prisoner could be convinced that they lived in a paradise, if the prison was pretty enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>ReDawn is a lot like &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/29/sunreach/">Sunreach&lt;/a> in that it&amp;rsquo;s a cousin to the main Skyward books, really expanding the universe and letting us know what the rest of Skyward flight (and others) were getting up to while Spensa was&amp;hellip; otherwise occupied.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around&amp;hellip; the point of view is Alanik, the near human alien that crashed into Detritus right at the beginning of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/26/starsight/">Starsight&lt;/a>, enabling the events of that book.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I didn’t know enough about human politics to know who was correct, but I did know enough about politics in general to guess that everyone would interpret the law in the way that best suited themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s facinating to have a point of view from someone who grew up in this universe on an alien world (bubbles of air around giant trees!) with an alien culture&amp;ndash;that in this case is actually tied to humanity throughout the past. It gives us a way to dig more into the relationships (especially the &amp;lsquo;relationships&amp;rsquo;) between the humans all the more, which I enjoyed a lot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course&amp;hellip; learning more about the Taynix / slugs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Broke in LA. Good times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course she finds her own trouble. And gets herself out of it. More or less. I like comics Kate Bishop.

&lt;p>In comics everything ends up connected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we get deaf Hawkeye storyline. Not quite the same as the show, but its neat seeing inspirations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To some extent&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the point is. It does definitely go into a lot of the networking and data structure details you&amp;rsquo;d need to build your own Redis. So it certainly lives up to the name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, I feel like a lot of the book is spent down in the weeds, implementing some of the less important details of how Redis works. At that level, it&amp;rsquo;s a generic networking/data structures book with Redis as the example. Which works, just not something that I need at this point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hawkeye, Volume 2: Little Hits</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/31/hawkeye-volume-2-little-hits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/31/hawkeye-volume-2-little-hits/</guid><description>&lt;p>Clint is in over his head.

&lt;p>What already went wrong…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell: the Black Vortex. A magical MacGuffin that can apparently make anyone… more. It’s up to our heroes (more or less) to…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/all-new-x-men-6-5-7c96ad.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Destroy it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Use it?!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And off we go on a wild ride that’s only sort of an X-Men story in that they’re at least in it (in various stages of powered up). But it’s still a neat one.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“A hero does not choose her trials. She steps into the darkness, then she faces what comes next.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you are the sort to want absolutely zero spoilers going into a book &lt;em>stop reading now&lt;/em>. Go read the book (it&amp;rsquo;s really good, that&amp;rsquo;s not a spoiler :spoiler:) and then come back. You have been warned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay, now that that&amp;rsquo;s out of the way. It&amp;rsquo;s been &amp;hellip; three years since I first read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/02/28/skyward/">Skyward&lt;/a>. WheN I read it, the sequels weren&amp;rsquo;t even out yet&amp;hellip; when Starsight first came out, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to it. I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat lamenting that lack now. 😄 But as they say, the second best time to plant a tree is today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, Starsight takes place where Skyward left off. Spensa has some crazy new powers she doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand, M-Bot is out in the open&amp;ndash;and really the star of the book&amp;ndash;, and humanity is ready to take back the stars&amp;hellip; More or less.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yup. Ya done screwed up Beast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beast mopes. Jean mopes. The future future Brotherhood come back to the past/future. Shape shifters shift shapes. Everything is timey whimey and complicated. No one really learns anything.&lt;/p>

I relatively recently came across the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PracticalEngineeringChannel">Practical Engineer&lt;/a> YouTube Channel, where he goes into a whole pile of various civil engineering and other infrastructure topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A particular favorite of mine is:&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_OpC4fH3mEk" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>So when I saw that he had a book&amp;hellip; of course I was going to read it! And it&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome. Topic by topic, he goes into a high level but with some detail on all sorts of ways that infrastructure actually works and neat things you can look out for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I certainly learned a lot and I highly recommend checking it out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>May your adventures bring you closer together, even as they take you far away from home.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Kate is delightful, I like seeing her growing relationship with Milligan. Constance seems to becoming slightly psychic, albeit in a way that they brush off as being very aware of the world and good at pattern matching. Sticky is more self aware while still being a wonderful brain about it all. And Reynie is growing into a solid natural leader. He already had it coming, but it&amp;rsquo;s still good to see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s less contained than the first book. Rather than mostly taking place in one place, it&amp;rsquo;s more of a kidnap/mysterious plot that ends up traveling a chunk of the world. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice change of pace, even if it feels a little contrived to get the kids on their own again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>All-New X-Men, Vol. 1: Yesterday's X-Men</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/09/all-new-x-men-vol.-1-yesterdays-x-men/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/09/all-new-x-men-vol.-1-yesterdays-x-men/</guid><description>&lt;p>Been a while since I’ve read any of the more direct ‘comic booky’ comics.

It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to realize that the song only came about in the 40s and this was only made into a movie in the 60s.

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve only read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/02/28/skyward/">Skyward&lt;/a> before of that series, so on re-reading, I noticed that Defending Elysium is sort of a prequel? It&amp;rsquo;s unclear to me exactly how much. It feels like the same world, but set well before and with none of the same characters? Especially since I haven&amp;rsquo;t read past Skyward before&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a bit more worldbuilding and background than I&amp;rsquo;d otherwise be aware of.&lt;/p>

But characterwise, I did enjoy the contrast between the titular Lady and the Tramp and it&amp;rsquo;s a nice enough story.

&lt;p>And what is life for us if we are not lurching from one life-or-death situation to another?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Maes is MIA and Joron picks up the slack in quite the way&amp;ndash;as the well named Black Pirate. It&amp;rsquo;s such a huge growth to see from him, from the very beginning when he and Maes first met and probably the best part of the books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also great to see how the increasing worldbuilding around the Guillame and the Keyshan come to bear. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more there than the reader or the characters really had to deal with at first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, I do feel somewhat let down by the latter half of the book. There&amp;rsquo;s an awful lot of interesting in the beginning; however, as everything builds and builds, despite plenty of action&amp;ndash;the story just sort of ends. I feel like there could have been more, but so it goes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Locklands</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/01/locklands/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/01/locklands/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We’re all the result of countless actions and choices made throughout the centuries, and the odds of those actions and choices going the exact same way again are basically nil.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s certainly a finale! After &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/06/foundryside/">Foundryside&lt;/a> started out as a nice bit of worldbuilding wrapped around a heist and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/28/shorefall/">Shorefall&lt;/a> turned things up to 11 with the return of the old, almost alien magic&amp;hellip; Now we have Locklands with hive minds, epic immortal duals, and finally&amp;hellip; a few answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man that&amp;rsquo;s a crazy (awesome) book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2022 Year in Reviews</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/31/2022-year-in-reviews/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 23:59:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/31/2022-year-in-reviews/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another year&amp;rsquo;s over&amp;hellip; and a new one just begun. In years past, I&amp;rsquo;ve done a seperate post for my &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/2021-reading-retrospective/">2021 Reading Retrospective&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/2021-tv-movies-retrospective/">2021 TV &amp; Movies Retrospective&lt;/a>, but&amp;hellip; that seems silly. Let&amp;rsquo;s do them all together this year!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In summary:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>126 total books: 40 graphic novels, 52 audiobooks, and 8 short stories / children&amp;rsquo;s books)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>24 seasons of TV shows&lt;/li>
&lt;li>31 movies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2245 (!) plays across 207 different board games, 88 of them new to me!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>45 different games played on Steam, 29 of them new to me&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I really should add board games and Steam games to my lists. Not sure how to do that though. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But really… it’s just that kind of story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m really loving the deeper backstory, the eternal competition, the real feeling that no matter how this story ends—no one ever makes it out alive in the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Wicked + The Divine, Vol. 6: Imperial Phase, Part II</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/31/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-6-imperial-phase-part-ii/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 00:00:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/31/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-6-imperial-phase-part-ii/</guid><description>&lt;p>Wow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the last few, I thought we were safe. That thing would escalate, sure, but that perhaps they’d all get to live happily ever after.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yeah. No.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much death and blood. So many twists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And onward we go!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Wicked + The Divine, Vol. 5: Imperial Phase, Part I</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/31/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-5-imperial-phase-part-i/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/31/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-5-imperial-phase-part-i/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/wicked-divine-5-b477ce.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love the contrast with the usual 1, 2, 3, 4–plus the very real ‘New’ status quo. Reading this on New Year’s Eve is just a bonus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So where are we.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Persephone is bonkers, but who can blame her. The Great Darkness might be coming… or perhaps Anake has been lying for thousands of years? The ‘now whats’ issue where everything falls apart. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Orville: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/30/the-orville-season-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/30/the-orville-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a Star Trek parody that&amp;rsquo;s more Star Trek than most (new) Star Trek. It&amp;rsquo;s got a really rough start while it&amp;rsquo;s still trying to lean into the humor, but as the show goes on and it gets more serious, it&amp;rsquo;s so much better. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to what they can do in season 2!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The truth is, you’re nobody’s first choice for this job. We have 3000 ships to staff and we need captains.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Wow. That was an awkward meet and greet. Supposed to be funny and an introduction to the characters I suppose, but… who would possibly think that’s okay?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Arts and crafts meets tardigrade redwood. Hilarious.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
