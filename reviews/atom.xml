It’s kind of bonkers how in the world you’re supposed to keep track of everything with all of these crossovers. Which I suppose is the idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/all-new-x-men-3-5-016b60.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Timey whimey madness ensues, we get a Back to the Future moment, the X-Men go home… who are we kidding. Of course things go weirder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth tracking down. Worth reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man that was a ride.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Out of Their Depth</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/13/out-of-their-depth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 23:00:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/13/out-of-their-depth/</guid><description>&lt;p>Man it’s complicated keeping track of things with shape shifters and mind readers and time travelers and all these different teams running around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Isn’t it great?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Here to Stay</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/13/here-to-stay/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 23:00:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/13/here-to-stay/</guid><description>&lt;p>Man super hero comics are bonkers. So much history. So many crossovers. And it’s all the more intense when you add time travel to the mix…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Love it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Engineering in Plain Sight: An Illustrated Field Guide to the Constructed Environment</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/12/engineering-in-plain-sight-an-illustrated-field-guide-to-the-constructed-environment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/12/engineering-in-plain-sight-an-illustrated-field-guide-to-the-constructed-environment/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a delightful read. I relatively recently came across the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PracticalEngineeringChannel">Practical Engineer&lt;/a> YouTube Channel, where he goes into a whole pile of various civil engineering and other infrastructure topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A particular favorite of mine is:&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_OpC4fH3mEk" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>So when I saw that he had a book&amp;hellip; of course I was going to read it! And it&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome. Topic by topic, he goes into a high level but with some detail on all sorts of ways that infrastructure actually works and neat things you can look out for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I certainly learned a lot and I highly recommend checking it out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;d like to see my various thoughts throughout the book, read on!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Perilous Journey</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/10/the-mysterious-benedict-society-and-the-perilous-journey/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/10/the-mysterious-benedict-society-and-the-perilous-journey/</guid><description>&lt;p>Man those are long books. 😄 Enjoyable though.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>May your adventures bring you closer together, even as they take you far away from home.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Kate is delightful, I like seeing her growing relationship with Milligan. Constance seems to becoming slightly psychic, albeit in a way that they brush off as being very aware of the world and good at pattern matching. Sticky is more self aware while still being a wonderful brain about it all. And Reynie is growing into a solid natural leader. He already had it coming, but it&amp;rsquo;s still good to see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s less contained than the first book. Rather than mostly taking place in one place, it&amp;rsquo;s more of a kidnap/mysterious plot that ends up traveling a chunk of the world. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice change of pace, even if it feels a little contrived to get the kids on their own again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Yesterday's X-Men</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/09/yesterdays-x-men/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/09/yesterdays-x-men/</guid><description>&lt;p>Been a while since I’ve read any of the more direct ‘comic booky’ comics.

A fun art style that really fits these videos, it&amp;rsquo;s something I watched each year when I was younger. Great to see once again. And it&amp;rsquo;s not any more out of date than it was before then.
It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to realize that the song only came about in the 40s and this was only made into a movie in the 60s. Especially since that means that for such a well know &amp;lsquo;Christmas&amp;rsquo; story, it&amp;rsquo;s really got very little backend religiously.</description></item><item><title>Defending Elysium</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/07/defending-elysium/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/07/defending-elysium/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“You must understand that he knew the risks of living in an undeveloped civilization. Creatures of lesser intelligence cannot be held responsible for their acts of barbarity. You have not yet learned a better way.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve only read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/02/28/skyward/">Skyward&lt;/a> before of that series, so on re-reading, I noticed that Defending Elysium is sort of a prequel? It&amp;rsquo;s unclear to me exactly how much. It feels like the same world, but set well before and with none of the same characters? Especially since I haven&amp;rsquo;t read past Skyward before&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a bit more worldbuilding and background than I&amp;rsquo;d otherwise be aware of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Short, but worth a read in my opinion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lady and the Tramp</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/07/lady-and-the-tramp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/07/lady-and-the-tramp/</guid><description>That&amp;rsquo;s a cute little movie. I think if you&amp;rsquo;re going to do the dog thing, I would strongly prefer {{crosslink &amp;ldquo;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&amp;rdquo;}}. Better music, decent story. Could be that I watched the latter far more.
But characterwise, I did enjoy the contrast between the titular Lady and the Tramp and it&amp;rsquo;s a nice enough story. Stylistically, I enjoy the city and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to not really see the human characters (it&amp;rsquo;s a dog movie after all.</description></item><item><title>The Wicked + The Divine, Vol. 9: Okay</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/03/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-9-okay/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/03/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-9-okay/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it ends. And a touch of Volume 8 actually came back to pull everything together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think I preferred the journey to the destination. It’s interesting to have closure, but still, I want to know what could possibly be next in this world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>C’est la vide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Wicked + The Divine, Vol. 8: Old Is the New New</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/03/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-8-old-is-the-new-new/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 00:00:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/03/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-8-old-is-the-new-new/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a penultimate volume … that was strange. It’s not part of the main story, but rather a number of loosely connected shorts. There are a lot of interesting stories to be told there… but not in such short snippets with so little time left.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward to the conclusion!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Bone Ship's Wake</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/02/the-bone-ships-wake/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/02/the-bone-ships-wake/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And what is life for us if we are not lurching from one life-or-death situation to another?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Maes is MIA and Joron picks up the slack in quite the way&amp;ndash;as the well named Black Pirate. It&amp;rsquo;s such a huge growth to see from him, from the very beginning when he and Maes first met and probably the best part of the books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also great to see how the increasing worldbuilding around the Guillame and the Keyshan come to bear. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more there than the reader or the characters really had to deal with at first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, I do feel somewhat let down by the latter half of the book. There&amp;rsquo;s an awful lot of interesting in the beginning; however, as everything builds and builds, despite plenty of action&amp;ndash;the story just sort of ends. I feel like there could have been more, but so it goes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Locklands</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/01/locklands/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/01/locklands/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We’re all the result of countless actions and choices made throughout the centuries, and the odds of those actions and choices going the exact same way again are basically nil.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s certainly a finale! After &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/06/foundryside/">Foundryside&lt;/a> started out as a nice bit of worldbuilding wrapped around a heist and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/28/shorefall/">Shorefall&lt;/a> turned things up to 11 with the return of the old, almost alien magic&amp;hellip; Now we have Locklands with hive minds, epic immortal duals, and finally&amp;hellip; a few answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man that&amp;rsquo;s a crazy (awesome) book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2022 Year in Reviews</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/31/2022-year-in-reviews/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 23:59:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/31/2022-year-in-reviews/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another year&amp;rsquo;s over&amp;hellip; and a new one just begun.

&lt;li>31 movies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2245 (!) plays across 207 different board games, 88 of them new to me!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>45 different games played on Steam, 29 of them new to me&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I really should add board games and Steam games to my lists. Not sure how to do that though. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But really… it’s just that kind of story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m really loving the deeper backstory, the eternal competition, the real feeling that no matter how this story ends—no one ever makes it out alive in the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Wicked + The Divine, Vol. 6: Imperial Phase, Part II</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/31/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-6-imperial-phase-part-ii/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 00:00:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/31/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-6-imperial-phase-part-ii/</guid><description>&lt;p>Wow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the last few, I thought we were safe. That thing would escalate, sure, but that perhaps they’d all get to live happily ever after.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yeah. No.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much death and blood. So many twists.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I love the contrast with the usual 1, 2, 3, 4–plus the very real ‘New’ status quo. Reading this on New Year’s Eve is just a bonus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So where are we.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Persephone is bonkers, but who can blame her. The Great Darkness might be coming… or perhaps Anake has been lying for thousands of years? The ‘now whats’ issue where everything falls apart.

It&amp;rsquo;s got a really rough start while it&amp;rsquo;s still trying to lean into the humor, but as the show goes on and it gets more serious, it&amp;rsquo;s so much better. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to what they can do in season 2!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Wow. That was an awkward meet and greet. Supposed to be funny and an introduction to the characters I suppose, but… who would possibly think that’s okay?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/06/foundryside/">Foundryside&lt;/a> was quite a ride, with an awesome magic system, great characters, and some nice not entirely too dark bits of revolution going on&amp;ndash;and hints of something more.

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an absolutely fascinating combination of weird anime sci-fi and more than a touch of weird western. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a few memorable characters (some perhaps&amp;hellip; too memorable), some weirdly wonderful worldbuilding and setting moments, and all sorts of gunfights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I can really recommend it. It started out weird, took a while to make any particular sense, and just when I felt it was getting there&amp;hellip; it ended. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly interesting, I&amp;rsquo;ll give it that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few question I still have after the show (spoilers):&lt;/p>
&lt;span class="spoiler">Where in the world did the names Vash and Millions Knives even come from? They're so different.&lt;/span>
&lt;p>And:&lt;/p>
&lt;span class="spoiler">Who (or what) were the Gung-Ho Guns? Literal demons? Natives? Weird humanity? What's with the vastly differently sized people.&lt;/span></description></item><item><title>Foundryside</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/06/foundryside/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/06/foundryside/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Every innovation—technological, sociological, or otherwise—begins as a crusade, organizes itself into a practical business, and then, over time, degrades into common exploitation. This is simply the life cycle of how human ingenuity manifests in the material world. What goes forgotten, though, is that those who partake in this system undergo a similar transformation: people begin as comrades and fellow citizens, then become labor resources and assets, and then, as their utility shifts or degrades, transmute into liabilities, and thus must be appropriately managed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that was delightful. It&amp;rsquo;s been on my list for a while, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give it a chance and I&amp;rsquo;m so very glad I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I highly recommend the book, with the disclaimer that there are some dark scenes, bits (sorry) of body horror, and quite a lot of (made up fantasy) swearing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Lost Metal</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/27/the-lost-metal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/27/the-lost-metal/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mate, it ain&amp;rsquo;t violence if it&amp;rsquo;s religion.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so it ends. The second era of one of the more ambitious ideas in fantasy: take a fantasy world with a hard/scientific magic system (or three), tell a crazy story in that world, and then advance a few hundred years so that the first story becomes the myths and religions of the world. Not only that, but (specifically in the Lost Metal), take that same idea and expand it across a shared universe of fantasy worlds, each with their own feel and magic and start really bringing things in from other worlds, mashing them together and seeing just what sort of madness pops out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/12/snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/12/snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs/</guid><description>&lt;p>An almost 100 year old movie, based on a story likely at least a century older, combining aspects of stories who knows how old, animated for the modern (of the time) movie going audience. It&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of a truely delightful era&amp;ndash;that of the Disney animated classics.

&lt;p>And it only gets weirder from there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/unwritten-10-381f87.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good choice of story though.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yup. That&amp;rsquo;s Aslan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course it&amp;rsquo;s going to take quite a story to get back to the &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; world from Fables&amp;hellip; But in a good way.

&lt;p>The trees were full of crows and the woods were full of madmen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pit was full of bones and her hands were full of wires.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that was a delightful surprise&amp;ndash;in a dark fairytale kind of way. I&amp;rsquo;ve not read any T. Kingfisher before, but I&amp;rsquo;ll have to remedy that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, Nettle &amp;amp; Bone takes the idea of a fairy godmother&amp;rsquo;s blessing at birth and twists it, bringing in the politics of unequal neighboring kingdoms; fae, their bargains, and all the twists that go with that; and a touch of demons and death magic. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun world to build a foundation on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, it&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful cast of characters. I love seeing Marra, third-born princess, sent to a religious order (sort of), and originally on her own to solve the world&amp;rsquo;s problems. Only for her to collect a motley band of strange and wonderful allies, each in their own ways: a witch, a reluctant godmother, a night, a dog made of bones, and a demon made of chicken. (It makes sense). They&amp;rsquo;re all great and I love the found family dynamic as they&amp;rsquo;re off to save the world&amp;ndash;or at least some tiny corner of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As if that weren&amp;rsquo;t enough, I love the prose and wordplay. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>written&lt;/em> like a fairytale writ large. It just fits the story so well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, One of the best books I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year and more than worth giving it a try.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 9: The Unwritten Fables</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/24/the-unwritten-vol.-9-the-unwritten-fables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/24/the-unwritten-vol.-9-the-unwritten-fables/</guid><description>&lt;p>Wait&amp;hellip; &lt;em>that&lt;/em> Fables.

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/unwritten-9-8c2e37.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not at all what I expected, but most appreciated. It&amp;rsquo;s great to see a number of old faces again, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I read Fables. They fit together about as strangely as you&amp;rsquo;d imagine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s fascinating bit of historical fantasy. Take revolutionary era France, introduce various relatively &amp;lsquo;common&amp;rsquo; classes of magicians (fire, water, weather, mind control, etc), and see what shakes out. It&amp;rsquo;s an era of history I&amp;rsquo;m probably not as familiar with as I should be and, while with the introduction of magic things are slightly different, the events actually shake out more or less the same way (as I looked up later). It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to read about people such as William Pitt and Maximilien Robespierre &amp;hellip; and then read about them again in real history.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Call of the Bone Ships</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/call-of-the-bone-ships/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/call-of-the-bone-ships/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/03/the-bone-ships/">The Bone Ships&lt;/a>&lt;/em> introduced us to the world&amp;ndash;where the bones of gigantic sea dragons once provided the building materials for ships, with hints of something even darker and more interesting going on in the background.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Call of the Bones Ships&lt;/em> takes up that up another level, really digging more into the often twisted politics and future of the world. It manages to give us quite a bit more insight into Joron Twiner, who is forced rather handedly to come into his own&amp;ndash;with whatever that ends up meaning&amp;ndash;and torturing him rather much along the way. We also get a lot of more of the gullaime (and the Gullaime specifically). There&amp;rsquo;s still a lot more to unpack there, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking for the third.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It ends up being rather a darker book, which fits even better as the successor to the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, wonderful worldbuilding, a darker tone, fascinating characters, and worth the re-read. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 8: Orpheus in the Underworld</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/22/the-unwritten-vol.-8-orpheus-in-the-underworld/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/22/the-unwritten-vol.-8-orpheus-in-the-underworld/</guid><description>&lt;p>A journey to Hell&amp;hellip; and a few faces we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in a while.

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not easy being green.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a strange one. She&amp;rsquo;s the Hulk&amp;rsquo;s cousin. One things lead to another, and she gets all Hulked out&amp;hellip; but without any of the downsides?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The contrast between being a Hulk and being a lawyer (and being a big green lawyer) is pretty cool, Tatiana Maslany does a wonderful job in the titular role, and it was great fun to see Tim Roth&amp;rsquo;s Abomination again, not to mention Charlie Cox&amp;rsquo;s Daredevil. Fun casting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s a really weird show. And they&amp;rsquo;re rather solidly into the whoe 4th wall breaking thing, which is kind of amusing. Weird. But amusing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I enjoyed the show.

Should be interesting seeing what’s different this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wow that&amp;rsquo;s violent. Just as bad if not worse than the comics, since you get to see it all on screen. But in a way that actually has some solid visuals and crazy scenes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Up</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/08/up/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/08/up/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whelp. That&amp;rsquo;s one major tear jerker of an intro. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even need words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest of the movie is a pretty fun romp of an adventure as well. The old man, too old for this crap / young boy just trying so very hard to do the right thing is great; the talking collars and how dogs think is hilarious; and the adventurey bits are solid and almost too exciting (depending on the age of the viewers).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A solid Pixar, well worth watching.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Free Guy</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/07/free-guy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/07/free-guy/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds playing a guy named Guy in a game&amp;ndash;but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t realize it. It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a lot of fun. Once you get the basic idea, you&amp;rsquo;ve got pretty much the entire plot, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun and well done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/movies/attachments/free-guy-62ba5c.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Far beneath the surface of the earth, hidden from the sun and the moon, upon the shores of the Starless Sea, there is a labyrinthine collection of tunnels and rooms filled with stories. Stories written in books and sealed in jars and painted on walls. Odes inscribed onto skin and pressed into rose petals. Tales laid in tiles upon the floors, bits of plot worn away by passing feet. Legends carved in crystal and hung from chandeliers. Stories catalogued and cared for and revered. Old stories preserved while new stories spring up around them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The Starless Sea&lt;/em> is an unfortunate sort of book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, the prose is beautiful. There are some really wonderful passages and smaller stories that really sing on the pages. On top of that, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of delightful visuals described from the book. Often times, I don&amp;rsquo;t really picture what&amp;rsquo;s going on in a lot of stories, I more&amp;hellip; absorb them. But this, this really needs and thrives on the visuals. Especially leaning on the sights and smells of books and libraries and doors, it&amp;rsquo;s the sort of book a physical book lover (not a lover of stories, one of the actual physical books themselves) could really get into.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand&amp;hellip; even after reading through the entire book, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what in the world was going on / what the point of anything was. A book doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to have a point&amp;ndash;I do love a good slice of life story&amp;ndash;but this felt like it was trying to go for something. But with the absolute pile of characters (major, minor, versions of the same) jumping around all the time, it was hard to figure anything out. The prose and settings almost do enough to overcome that&amp;hellip; but not quite enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s a book that was almost really really good&amp;hellip; but didn&amp;rsquo;t quite stick the landing for me. It&amp;rsquo;s probably worth a try, but if you bounce off the first few chapters, consider that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really change that much before the end.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 6: Tommy Taylor and the War of Words</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-unwritten-vol.-6-tommy-taylor-and-the-war-of-words/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-unwritten-vol.-6-tommy-taylor-and-the-war-of-words/</guid><description>&lt;p>The story is going now.

&lt;p>Saints become martyrs before they get to be heroes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure what to expect. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t actually read the books (although now I really wanted to) and for the first episode or two, I really thought it was some sort of cheesy YA fantasy, a la Hunger Games and the ilk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But a few episodes in&amp;hellip; and it really started to grow on me. The world building is fascinating, primarily the basis on a broad Asian setting, but with an emphasis on Russian roots, with some influences (in other nations) from China and India. The magic system is a bit cheesey and somewhat unexplained (so far), but at the very least it&amp;rsquo;s pretty?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, you have absolutely wonderful characters/actors. Jessie Mei Li nails it as lead Alina Starkov, Ben Barnes as General Kirigan&amp;ndash;plays his character rather well (&lt;span class="spoiler">he actually has the gravitas of old, powerful, and twisted, which not everyone can pull off&lt;/span>
). But the ones that really shine are the Crows (I don&amp;rsquo;t think they&amp;rsquo;re referred to as such in the show?): Freddy Carter as Kaz, Amita Suman as Inej and Kit Young as Jesper. There are rumors that they might get their own show and that would be &lt;strong>awesome&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, worth a watch. And we&amp;rsquo;re getting Season 2, hopefully sometime next year? Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Soul Taken</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/05/soul-taken/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/05/soul-taken/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This frail cloth, a gift to the person he had once been, was his touchstone, a reminder that once he had been whole. Once there had been joy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a crazy book for backstory. We get more backstory of Wulfe and Sherwood (big answers there), a bit more about Zee (he&amp;rsquo;s terrifying, but still a good guy), and even more escalations / variations on what it means that Mercy&amp;rsquo;s Coyote-magic is based around boundaries and death. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting variation, a complicated book, and well worth reading.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars: Visions</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/05/star-wars-visions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/05/star-wars-visions/</guid><description>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating expirment. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure who got that made, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad they did. Take Star Wars, give it to a bunch of different Japanese (or Japanese inspired) animators, and make sure that nothing in this will be canon (so you can tell all sorts of stories). There aren&amp;rsquo;t any particularly deep, they&amp;rsquo;re too short for that. But beautiful, oh this series has that in spades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a watch!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Bone Ships</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/03/the-bone-ships/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/03/the-bone-ships/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating bit of worldbuilding. In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s a world (or at least story) dominated by naval superiority&amp;ndash;brought about by ships built on the literal bones of sea dragons. And what&amp;rsquo;s more, the sea dragons appear to have been hunted to extinction, making the warships all the more rare and valuable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a very cool root for the story and Barker only takes it from there with unique twists on vocab and word choice, a few other interesting bits of magic, and more naval everything than you can shake some paint at.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do quite enjoy the characters as well. Setting the story around a prison ship? Not that unusual, but I really do love how much Barker makes the reader care for the people on it&amp;ndash;and to see them grow together as a grow. Lucky Maes is of course awesome as well&amp;ndash;and I do love the more alien birdman. Want to see what more is going on there for sure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a great book and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have read it.
