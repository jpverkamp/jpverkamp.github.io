      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s a very solid movie. The casting is top notch, the style is wonderfully afrofuturistic, and the plot/motivation is interesting enough.
Starting with the plot/motivation, I think that the choice to have Wakanda separated from the rest of the world, all through centuries of slavery and inequality is certainly an interesting one. And I&amp;rsquo;m not at all alone.

      <description>Ooh, that poster. le kiss
Thor was &amp;hellip; fine, a weirdly downscale introduction to a kind of strange character early in the MCU. Thor: The Dark World went the other way, being too bigt and ambitious and suffering somewhat for it. So going into Thor: Ragnarok, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what we were going to get.
An absolute gem of an 80s sci fi/fantasy action superhero comedy that just works. Right from the very intro, you know it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a different sort of movie.</description>

      <description>After the surprisingly awesome Guardians of the Galaxy, it was really a question of: could they do it again? The answer, a resounding&amp;hellip; sort of?
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has some pretty awesome moments. The opening battle in particular is spectacular (I love the contrast of dancing Baby Groot against a big smack down in the background). And we get all piles of additional humor based around Drax&amp;rsquo;s literalness, Rocket being a racoon, &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>A great season! I loved all of the people on here. I was writing up my favorite and &amp;hellip; I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it. They&amp;rsquo;re all a lot of fun.
 First entry in the first task: How large are Greg Davies’ shits… We’re off to quite a season. Hiding eggplants is a wonderful task. “It’s amazing how much it compacts down into a baby’s head.” “You scored the same as Rose… and she couldn’t see.</description>

      <description>Wong: While heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers, we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats.
 Man, that is a visually stunning movie. The first battle with building magically twisting all over (a la Inception), the glowing magic rings, the magical doodads. I am ever thankful that superhero movies have gotten popular enough that studios will spend the big bucks on special effects. They really do look great.</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eren is out and about and a jerk (even if he&amp;rsquo;s probably right). Zeke has plans involving spinal fluid (eesh) and gets captured. And there&amp;rsquo;s a plan that could very well end the existence of Titans entirely&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is hurtling towards and ending. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating and oh so weird.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Well that&amp;rsquo;s quite a beginning and ending, with a whole lot in between. One of the biggest changes is the introduction of Ronan Dex. Replacement for Lt. Ford who has a tendency to shoot first and ask questions&amp;ndash;well, never. He&amp;rsquo;s quite the character and a good addition to the team. Interesting that the main team is half from Pegasus now.

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that certainly got away from me. Only a half dozen more volumes to go, let&amp;rsquo;s finish this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the main reason that I&amp;rsquo;ve started drifting from the series is how much broader it&amp;rsquo;s gotten in scope and scale. At first, it was one city in a world full of monsters. Now the world is looking in on one island and there&amp;rsquo;s oh so much more going on that we&amp;rsquo;re just now hearing about 27 volumes in&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Captain America: Civil War isn&amp;rsquo;t really a Captain America movie. While it deals with the Winter Solder to some extent, as much as that it&amp;rsquo;s an Iron Man movie since he killed Stark&#39;s parents... . But really, it&amp;rsquo;s an Avengers movie. Everyone shows up, takes sides, and eventually ends up a great big superhero fight. And It&amp;hellip; Is&amp;hellip; Spectacular. In my opinion, it&amp;rsquo;s the best MCU movie to this point, beating out any of the solo outings and even the first two Avengers movies.</description>

      <description>Continuing in the set of Marvel movies that came out after I stopped going to theaters quite so much / reviewing movies in 2014, we have Ant-Man!
In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s a heist movie/comedy with superheroes!
It&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful movie, with a lighter, funnier theme than a lot of the movies. The cast is wonderful. Paul Rudd is hilarious and well cast as Ant-Man, Michael Douglas is a wonderful cranky old man scientist that&amp;rsquo;s been burned as Hank Pym, Corey Stoll is a wonderful crazy (spoilers) bad guy, and Evangeline Lilly is criminally underused.</description>

      <description>Bugs Bunny: So, you want me, a talking cartoon bunny, to play with you, an NBA superstar, in a high-stakes basketball game?
Sounds awfully familiar.
LeBron James: Who are you talking to?
 Well. That was certainly a thing.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched the original Space Jam in probably 20 years&amp;hellip; but I remember it fondly enough. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I really want to go back and watch it again.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an odd season. The original plotline had to be thrown out on account of the actress that played Tony&#39;s mom dying , so the whole &amp;lsquo;do they have a case against Tony&amp;rsquo; thing falls through. As a result, it&amp;rsquo;s not the most cohesive of seasons, but there are a few gems in here still.

&lt;p&gt;A gnome, a sprite, a wyvern, a green blob, a were-Pomeranian, and the Antichrist get sent to live in an orphanage on an island&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like the setup for a rather strange joke, but instead the punchline is a delightful, amusing, and surprisingly touching story about actually taking the time to notice and perhaps care for someone a little bit different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hawkeye: The city is flying and we&amp;rsquo;re fighting an army of robots. And I have a bow and arrow. Nothing makes sense.
 Age of Ultron is an odd movie. From the perspective of a summer blockbuster/action movie, it&amp;rsquo;s solid. The opening action scene is wonderfully avengerful, there are all manner of awesome fights (the Hulk versus Iron Man fight and the final battle come to mind), and we get a few new characters.</description>

      <description>Another MCU made for Disney+ TV outing. After the amazing WandaVision and Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Loki had a high bar to clear. In my nutshell: they nailed it.
 I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose.
 Loki (the character) is fascinating. He started out a well cast mostly villain of his own in Thor and became the first recurring villain in The Avengers.</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cute addition to the series. The Borrowers have made it to Little Fordham. We get a bit of backstory about the maker of the tiny town and of course there&amp;rsquo;s a baddie making a town of his own. The Borrowers get Borrowernapped, they learn how to make a balloon, and they soar back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to like about this series, especially the miniature worlds and how the Borrowers can use any manner of things in ways we never intended them. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day eighteen years ago, Gideon&amp;rsquo;s mother had tumbled down the middle of
the shaft in a dragchute and a battered hazard suite, like some moth
drifting slowly down into the dark. The suit had been out of power for a
couple of minutes. The woman landed brain-dead. All the battery power had
been sucked away by a bio-container plugged into the suit, the kind you&amp;rsquo;d
care a transplant limb in, and inside that container was Gideon, only a day
old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was obviously mysterious as hell.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I had forgotten just how fun Guardians of the Galaxy is. Back when I first reviewed it in 2014, it surprised me with how different it was and just how much it opened up the Marvel Universe. Well, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen some pretty crazy things since then (Thor Ragnarok springs to mind), but it&amp;rsquo;s still a pretty crazy movie. I mean, come on. It&amp;rsquo;s a man obsessed with classic rock, a badass green woman assassin, an overly literal shirtless wrestler, a cybernetically enhanced racoon, and a speaking tree 1 2.</description>

&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get into it. I missed the limited focus and the mystery of the first book. Even, for what very little we knew about them, the characters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>That &amp;hellip; is a summer blockbuster.
It&amp;rsquo;s an absolutely bonkers plot. In a nutshell, the future is at war with the present (somehow) and there is technology that can &amp;lsquo;invert&amp;rsquo; people and things so that they experience time backwards. How exactly that works and what exactly happens when you mess with the past/future is&amp;hellip; never entirely clear. But it certainly does make for some absolutely crazy action scenes where some things are going forward, some backward, people are in the same scene more than once and&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Annihilation</title>

                &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;17934530&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934530.annihilation&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/annihilation.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must understand how I felt then, how the surveyor must have felt: We &amp;gt; were scientists, trained to observe natural phenomena and the results of &amp;gt; human activity. We had not been trained to encounter what appeared to be the &amp;gt; uncanny. In unusual situations there can be a comfort in the presence of &amp;gt; even someone you think might be your enemy. Now we had come close to the &amp;gt; edges of something unprecedented, and less than a week into our mission we &amp;gt; had lost not just the linguist at the border but our anthropologist and our &amp;gt; psychologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that is a fascinating sort of book. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a slice of life mixed with cosmic horror. The entire story follows an expedition into the mysterious, alien Area X. There&amp;rsquo;s not really any overarching plot, other than exploring and perhaps surviving&amp;hellip; and maybe if you&amp;rsquo;re really really lucky, coming back without going mad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there&amp;rsquo;s that. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit out of genre for me&amp;ndash;read by group choice, so I really don&amp;rsquo;t know how it compares to it&amp;rsquo;s peer books, but I enjoyed it well enough. It was certainly fascinating to read at the same time as &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;28962996&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28962996.six-wakes&#34;&gt;Six Wakes&lt;/a&gt; (which, to be honest, I enjoyed rather more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the plot is fine. It&amp;rsquo;s a murder mystery. There are a few decent bits of interesting world building. It&amp;rsquo;s a small town with what seems to me an unusually large art scene and number of bow hunters. There are some witchy bits which really made me wish this was actually subtle urban fantasy. And a few twists and turns along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Man this show just keeps going.
They actually lowered the amount of nudity a bit from Season 1 (as HBO tends to do), but the violence is still going strong… It’s fascinating (and solid writing) to see the fall out from the big events of season 1, along with entirely new plotlines with Janice (Tony’s brother), Richard Aprile (who’s got crazy eyes), Christopher really getting into (and out of) writing, and drama with the entire Soprano family/children.</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a sigh, I resign myself to combing through it page by page, though 502
pages is so many to wade through, and I curse authors who write such lengthy
books when a few neat pages of prose would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Roughly halfway through a nearly 1000 page book&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;28962996&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28962996.six-wakes&#34;&gt;Six Wakes&lt;/a&gt; is a closed room murder mystery in SPACE! With clones! What that gives us is an absolutely wonderful variation on the tropes. Because of cloning technology, you can very well have a murder mystery where the cast wake up to the gruesome (zero gee) murder of &amp;hellip; the entire cast. And because it&amp;rsquo;s a generation ship in deep space, you very well know that one of the cast absolutely has to have been the muderer&amp;hellip; Unless it was more than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite parts of the worldbuilding all really revolve around technology of cloning and how that can change the world in fascinating ways. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon for attendees at certain parties to end murdered. They&amp;rsquo;ll wake up in the morning, restored from a backup the day before with little more than a feeling of &amp;lsquo;that must have been one hell of a party&amp;rsquo; plus some potential embarrassment and go about their lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh that&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful book.

The sense of humor mixed with scientific/engineering problem solving is the main strength in both. Great fun.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X-COM holds a special place in my life. It was one of if not the very first computer games I bought. I played the heck out of that game; I bought the strategy guide (and got one for Apocalypse, even though I didn’t yet own it) and still fire up an emulator to give it a try every year or three. It’s just a wonderful tactics game, the like of which I’ve never really managed to find again—at least to my tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I saw the Kickstarter for a Monsters in the Dark, I knew I had to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming languages are something of a hobby of mine. Going as far back as undergrad, I’ve written a fair few interpreters and compilers over the years. I’ve never really gotten beyond a strong basic level, but I’ve always wanted to. Crafting Interpreters is a great book for exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book essentially walks you through two styles of interpreter of the same language: just an AST walking style written in Java (the sort I’ve done a few times) and then a much more optimized one based on bytecode. There was something to learn on both sections though, since the the introduced language (lox) includes higher order functions and closures—certainly more interesting bits of languages to implement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s more than a handfull of glowing five star reviews and a smaller but still significant number that just didn&amp;rsquo;t get what the fuss was about. Halfway through&amp;hellip; I totally get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the main problem is the absolute tonal shift that happens about halfway through the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Rounding out the first 8 series that are available directly on YouTube in the US, finally Series 7!
Man this was a season. Man those are some characters. James Acaster has a barely contained rage beneath his humor (sometimes now so barely). Jessica Knappett, hilarious with some crazy outfits. Kerry Godliman: a wonderfully direct way to solving tasks. Phil Wang (and Phil Wang&amp;rsquo;s wang). That outfit&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s certainly a thing.</description>

      <description>After the crazy violence and nudity of Watchmen, you&amp;rsquo;d think perhaps we&amp;rsquo;d go for something a little more &amp;hellip; safe for next time around.
Nah.
The Sopranos.
It&amp;rsquo;s one of the best rated TV shows of all time (on IMDb, only Breaking Bad (which I watched just before I started reviewing TV series), Avatar: The Last Airbender (it&amp;rsquo;s great), and Game of Thrones (pre Season 8) are rated higher among fiction).</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a cute little addition to the Borrower’s world. After being ousted from their first home to live out of doors for a book, the Borrowers get another chance at ‘civilization’, this time even with family around! But alas, all is soon to end and off they go on another adventure, trying to find another life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fun story, full of tiny adventures. While again, the ending and the frame story are by far the weakest parts of these books, they’re still great fun and well worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh this extended world. The idea that there is a race of people (the Eldians) with a special power unique to their people which makes them makes them hated and feared, relegated to a suppressed class. Except a minor few that are brain washed and weaponized. It&amp;rsquo;s a story we&amp;rsquo;ve heard time and time again, even going back throughout history, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s a bad story. It&amp;rsquo;s one that really needs to be told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two in a row! It&amp;rsquo;s like Christmas! If Christmas was chuck full of creepy uberpowerful fae&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major plot threads is dealing with the fallout of &lt;a data-goodreads-type=&#34;book&#34; data-goodreads-id=&#34;25026912&#34; href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25026912.storm-cursed&#34;&gt; Storm Cursed &lt;/a&gt; . Mercy and co may have won the day, but in doing so they managed to tick off a great number of very powerful beings, lost a strong ally, and may have caused some permanent harm to Adam and Mercy&amp;rsquo;s relationship. I really hated this at first&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve loved how solid the relationships of the main characters are in these books, letting them deal with huge problems together&amp;ndash;but by the end I&amp;rsquo;m at least willing to see where this goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Attack on Titan, Vol. 23</title>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fascinating change of scope. After so long on what we thought of as the entire world (although of course we&amp;rsquo;d guessed it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case), now we have an entire much larger world, more advanced in a lot of ways both in science and knowing about Titans. Crazy times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus a bit more backstory of Reiner and a handful of new characters that purposely are training to be Titans, all to willingly take on the Titans for only 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last re-read/listen through the Mercy Thompson books. I had forgotten just host much things had been changing on a larger world building scale in the last few books: since Mercy put herself and her pack on the line defending the people and territory of the Columbia Basin, things have gotten complicated. And dark. And did I mention complicated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating world building.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have hated words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As grim and depressing as a book set around Nazi Germany narrated by death can be, I actually quite enjoyed this story. Zusak certainly has quite a way with words and the story is alternatively terrifying (in a way that makes you think) and touching (likewise).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that&amp;rsquo;s a switch. We have a notebook talking about Eren&amp;rsquo;s father&amp;rsquo;s life outside of the walls, just how large the rest of the world is, and how the Attack Titan came to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what in the world are they going to do?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>And so it begins again.
While Stargate SG-1 really has a solid place in my heart, in a way I like Atlantis even better. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it could have been what it is without SG-1, but with it, it&amp;rsquo;s made even better.
You have a generally optimistic can do attitude, backed up by McKay quite often saving the day (which is crazy coming off SG-1, I forgot how annoying he is and just how much he grows throughout the seasons of Atlantis).</description>

      <description>From one of the weakest MCU movies to one of the strongest. I loved the first solo entry of Captain American and the second is even better. Much like last time, I very much enjoyed this movie.
It&amp;rsquo;s a solid contrast against the first Captain America (blind optimistic patriotism versus a darker world, where even your friends&amp;hellip; might not be). It&amp;rsquo;s made all the better having already seen the future of Sam and Bucky/The Winter Soldier now.</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So close and yet so far. So many are dead, trying to (did they succeed after all) to take down the Beast Titan. And now they have a choice. Theoretically, they can steal one of the Titan&amp;rsquo;s abilities and save one of their own&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Finally back to where it all began. We have a bit of trying to find the show&amp;rsquo;s footing. I think Romesh Ranganathan was my favorite this series.
Favorite task:
 Episode 1, Task 2: Eat as much watermelon as possible in one minute. HULK SMASH! Also, totally throwing up.  It&amp;rsquo;s probably the weakest season, but it more than gets a pass for all the wonderful things that came to be later.</description>

      <description>I really like most of the people in this season. Alice Levine seems straight laced and perhaps sweet until she throws something at you out of left field. Asim Chaudhry hit the &amp;lsquo;you&amp;rsquo;re going to lose now&amp;rsquo;, although didn&amp;rsquo;t actually end up coming in last. Tim Vine though&amp;hellip; oh Tim Vine. There always has to be one in a crazy outfit and he performs most of the tasks in some sort of safari outfit and hat.</description>

      <description>Oh Noel Fielding. You&amp;rsquo;re &amp;hellip; a class all your own. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many other people that had so very many 1 and 5 point tasks with little in between. Having Mel Giedroyc there as well (also from the Great British Bake Off) was extra amusing. Another favorite of mine though was Hugh Dennis. So very British sense of humor.
Favorite tasks:
 Episode 1, Task 1: Most unusual autograph on the most unusual vegetable.</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, Fire Touched manages to back down from the scale of the previous two books. We&amp;rsquo;re no longer fighting primordial spirits or gods, but rather &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; the Fae. Of course, as we see through the course of the book, there are some Fae who might as well be gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, this book as many as any that came before will really change the shape of the future of the universe that Briggs is building. In a nutshell, the wolves are going politically toe to toe with the Fae. Anything more than that would be even more a spoiler, but it&amp;rsquo;s still another interesting bit of worldbuilding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know; it is really quite impressive that the Survey Corps has been doing even this well against there Collosus/Armorered/Beast Titans. Human intellect and all those strengths. Oy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then&amp;hellip; sacrifices and boom sticks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
