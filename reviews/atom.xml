I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;d watched this season before, but not reviewed it, so here you go.
Charlotte Ritchie - She feels so out of her depth, always trying to keep things light and innocent. Bit of a running joke how she&amp;rsquo;d best fit a children&amp;rsquo;s show. She almost came close to not being completely destroyed in the final scoring. Jamali Maddix - The rule breaker of the episode.</description></item><item><title>Star Wars Vol. 6: Out Among the Stars</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/21/star-wars-vol.-6-out-among-the-stars/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/21/star-wars-vol.-6-out-among-the-stars/</guid><description>&lt;p>STAR WARS #33-37
Annual #3&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So many different stories in this one!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have the beach episode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-2015-v6-92790a.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Lando Calrissian and Sana Starros team up…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-2015-v6-8ac441.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>…double (triple? Quadruple?!) cross!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Han (with a weirdly photorealistic face) and Chewie transporting a Hutt:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-2015-v6-423a7f.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And R2-D2 on a mission!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-2015-v6-77462f.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’d … forgotten that C-3PO had gotten captured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if that wasn’t enough, Scar Squadron—and our favorite Storm Trooper with a lightsaber.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-2015-v6-580a95.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s still weird to type.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do enjoy the idea of a Storm Trooper just trying to do the right thing—that doesn’t actually join or even &lt;em>support&lt;/em> the Rebellion. It’s a neat story we haven’t gotten in the movies/TV (that I’ve seen).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s quite the mix and feels a bit disjoined, but I enjoyed it all well enough. I just was hoping for a bit more closure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Heidi</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/20/heidi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/20/heidi/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a cute little story of a little girl with quite the tough start on life, finding (and bringing out) love in everyone she meets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Heidi is just so innocent and fun. Her grandfather is the prototypical gruff old man with a heart of gold. Peter&amp;ndash;the Goat General&amp;ndash;is hilarious and a fun counter to the overwhelming wholesomeness. Clara you just want the best for&amp;ndash;and yay magical mountain air!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s not much in the way of plot, but that&amp;rsquo;s all right. You&amp;rsquo;re still going to get a chance to live vicariously through Heidi for a few hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s probably a lesson in there touching on ideas of homeschooling, parental rights, and living outdoors and off the land, but really, it&amp;rsquo;s more a matter of the times (written in 1880) than anything. Take it as you will.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth the read, especially if you have little ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Broken Soul</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/19/broken-soul/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/19/broken-soul/</guid><description>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s quite a book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first, it&amp;rsquo;s more of the same. Jane dealing with vampire politics and her own love life as things just keep getting a bit crazier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then we learn that the European vampires are coming to visit. And they might just want to poke their noses into various artifacts Jane has picked up through the books&amp;ndash;or that Leo has and Jane hasn&amp;rsquo;t realized yet&amp;hellip; Including another big piece of vampire history.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And &lt;em>then&lt;/em> we get a whole deeper look into the metaphysics of the Jane&amp;rsquo;s universe. Light dragons. More about what the Mercy Blade actually is. More about Soul. And perhaps&amp;ndash;more about how Jane&amp;rsquo;s own history and powers might fit in with all of it. It&amp;rsquo;s going quite a different direction than most Urban Fantasy I&amp;rsquo;ve read and I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated to see where this is going.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus, it&amp;rsquo;s a major upgrade for Jane&amp;rsquo;s powers&amp;ndash;which she may very well need to survive&amp;ndash;even if it comes at quite the cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like I said, it gets crazier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And on top of all &lt;em>that&lt;/em>, we actually get a bit of a straight forward&amp;ndash;well, relative to what&amp;rsquo;s come before&amp;ndash;relationship for Jane!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“For a reason or a season,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;ldquo;For a year or a lifetime. For a poem or a song. For a victorious battle or a bloody death. For honor. I would stand by you for as long as I might live.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s about time&amp;hellip; I hope the best for them, at least for a little while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a crazy book and worth the read if you&amp;rsquo;ve already made it this far. Even if (minor spoilers) &amp;hellip; we don&amp;rsquo;t actually even &lt;em>get&lt;/em> to the European vampires for the most part!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: Almost the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/11/25/broken-souls/">second book by that title&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars: The Screaming Citadel</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/19/star-wars-the-screaming-citadel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/19/star-wars-the-screaming-citadel/</guid><description>&lt;p>Crossover!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-the-screaming-citadel-3fa8e3.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Doctor Aphra… and Black Krrsantan? (And the droids of course).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That certainly has potential! Force Vampires! (of course that’s a thing) The titular “Screaming Citadel”—delightfully Gothic. Mind control brain crabs. It’s got it all!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a little ridiculous at times and leans &lt;em>far&lt;/em> more into the fantasy side of Star Wars, but I enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr></description></item><item><title>Fire Ice</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/18/fire-ice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/18/fire-ice/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another day (week?), another Cussler. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve read this one before, but that&amp;rsquo;s sort of the appeal of all of these books&amp;ndash;some quasihistorical inciting incident (that happens on or near the oceans) then jump to the present time to find the resulting shipwreck and deal with the secret organization (for example) that&amp;rsquo;s trying to RULE THE WORLD.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time with more Russia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have the daughters of Nikolai II, last Emperor of Russia&amp;ndash;on the run with all the royal jewels, including one very shiny crown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cut to the modern era, we have a Russian spy who&amp;rsquo;s gone toe to toe with Kurt Austin several times over the years, a manic trying to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/methane%20clathrate">blow up the ocean floor&lt;/a> and cause &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsunamis">tsunamis&lt;/a>, and gangs of modern neo-&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossacks">Cossacks&lt;/a> trying to bring back Mother Russia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s exactly what it says on the tin&amp;ndash;a &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/numa-files/">NUMA Files&lt;/a> novel&amp;ndash;and quite the adventure for all that. Formulaic, but a fun listen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars Vol. 5: Yoda's Secret War</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/17/star-wars-vol.-5-yodas-secret-war/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/17/star-wars-vol.-5-yodas-secret-war/</guid><description>&lt;p>C-3PO has been captured!
&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-2015-v5-c45575.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I’m not sure who’s the worse off for it. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s not &lt;em>entirely&lt;/em> clear if Darth Vader recognizes him or not. With as many memory wipes as C-3PO has apparently gone through, it’s worth wondering if he’s still even the same as he was when Anakin first built him…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But really, in an interesting sort of flip, most of this volume is the backstory! And—as might be hinted at by the title—we actually get pre-Prequel era Yoda! And Qui-Gon Jinn. Now I want to read more Qui-Gon Jinn stories. I wonder if that’s a thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, Yoda on a planet of feral—and force sensitive because of course—children. Because of course that’s a story that has to be in the Star Wars canon. It actually gets far more interesting that I expected, but as Star Wars (outside of the movies) seems wont to do… things get &lt;em>weird&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a fascinating story, but again falls a bit into ‘just how much did Luke do outside of the movies’ trap that just feels weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars Vol. 4: Last Flight of the Harbinger</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/14/star-wars-vol.-4-last-flight-of-the-harbinger/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/14/star-wars-vol.-4-last-flight-of-the-harbinger/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two main plots this time: good guys and bad guys—it’s all in your point of view and the Big Three steal something even bigger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s fascinating how these stories at once seem smaller and more compact—not able to stretch out on the big screen—and at the same time tackle things the movies couldn’t dare to approach in two hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a side note: how much or how little the artwork looks like Mark Hammill/Harrison Ford/Carrie Fisher varies &lt;em>widely&lt;/em>, especially if you include issue covers.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr></description></item><item><title>Star Wars Vol. 3: Rebel Jail</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/11/star-wars-vol.-3-rebel-jail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/11/star-wars-vol.-3-rebel-jail/</guid><description>&lt;p>Backstory! Work Obi-Wan and Luke’s uncle. A prison hidden tucked right up against a sun. Hearding Nerfs. Sana, Leia, and Aphra… working together?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a decent enough adventure with quite the set pieces. I just wish I had more time in Obi-Wan’s backstory now!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-2015-v3-textbundle-17ed10.png" alt="">&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vader Down</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/07/vader-down/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/07/vader-down/</guid><description>&lt;p>And now things get complicated… Vader Down is a crossover between &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/star-wars-2015/">Star Wars (2015)&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/star-wars-darth-vader-2015/">Star Wars: Darth Vader (2015)&lt;/a> and a single standalone issue. It’s a neat story, but out so I wish there were easier to read on Marvel Unlimited…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out Anakin can still fly…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-vader-down-textbundle-413633.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, Vader is forced down. One thing leads to another and the Rebellion decides that an entire battalion might be needed to keep him down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This may not be enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s nice to see Dr. Aphra again. Been a a bit. And oh the droids.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For as annoying as it is to switch from series to series, that’s quite an enjoyable story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title> Star Wars Vol. 2: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/04/star-wars-vol.-2-showdown-on-the-smugglers-moon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/04/star-wars-vol.-2-showdown-on-the-smugglers-moon/</guid><description>&lt;p>The continuing in between adventures of all our original trilogy friends!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a fun one, a dueling pair of adventures and a bit of backstory bridging the original trilogy and the prequels. I think that’d be an interesting era to read more about. How exactly did things go &lt;em>so badly&lt;/em> so quickly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blue Gold</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/03/blue-gold/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/03/blue-gold/</guid><description>In this century wars will not be fought over oil, as in the past, but over water. The situation is becoming desperate. The world&amp;rsquo;s water is strained by population growth. There is no more fresh water on earth than two thousand years ago when the population was three percent of its current size.
Oof.

This time, getting a bit away from Vadar, we have Star Wars (2015). Set (initially) right after A New Hope, we have the fallout of the (first) Death Star and the whole gang out on a variety of adventures!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a fun start. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing where they go from here!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Taskmaster: Series 10</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/29/taskmaster-series-10/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/29/taskmaster-series-10/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m so not watching these in order. But they&amp;rsquo;re back on YouTube in the US! So let&amp;rsquo;s catch up.
It&amp;rsquo;s a fun season. We have:
Daisy Mae Cooper: So pregnant. And quite often unfiltered, which is a lot of fun. Johnny Vegas: You just want everything to go right for the guy&amp;hellip; and it so often does not. My favorite this time around. Katherine Parkinson: Impressively bad about missing parts of tasks.</description></item><item><title>Serpent</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/25/serpent/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/25/serpent/</guid><description>“Nereus, the Old Man of the Sea,” Nina murmured, cocking her head in thought. “There’s a quote from Hesiod, the Greek poet: ‘A trusty and gentle god who thinks just and kindly thoughts and never lies.”
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve read any Clive Cussler. Turns out there are even a few new Dirk Pitt books I&amp;rsquo;ll have to catch up on. But even then, I still haven&amp;rsquo;t actually read any of his second related series: The NUMA Files.</description></item><item><title>The Sunlit Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/23/the-sunlit-man/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/23/the-sunlit-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so ends the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/year-of-sanderson/">Year of Sanderson&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/19/tress-of-the-emerald-sea/">Tress&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/14/yumi-and-the-nightmare-painter/">Yumi&lt;/a> already hinted at new and interesting worlds in the far future of the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-cosmere/">The Cosmere&lt;/a>, but the connections were (relatively) small parts of the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Sunlit man is a bit more tied in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s still in the far future. And oh, the hints we get at where the Cosmere is going&amp;hellip; but this time, we have a protagonist we&amp;rsquo;ve met before, chock full of references to stories we&amp;rsquo;ve seen&amp;ndash;and a few that haven&amp;rsquo;t happened yet. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into who it is&amp;ndash;spoilers!&amp;ndash;but it&amp;rsquo;s a neat surprise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a solid story as all the Cosmere secret projects have been. I think I prefer Tress and Yumi over Sunlit Man, but it&amp;rsquo;s by absolutely no means a bad book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think my only real negative is&amp;hellip; I want more! More of protagonist. More of the Night Brigade. More of this weird offshoot society. More worldbuilding and magic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I&amp;rsquo;m worried we won&amp;rsquo;t see more/any of this for at the very least a very long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s still very worth the read.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit since we&amp;rsquo;ve seen Molly and the Trueblood family&amp;ndash;what with killing her sister gone evil and all. I missed them. The dynamic between Jane and Molly was interesting, as was the relationship between Molly and her husband Evan (from what relatively little we saw of it). And Angie is fascinating&amp;ndash;so much potential for crazy things to happen there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So when Evan almost literally blows into town, blaming Jane for Molly gone missing? Only for some of Katie&amp;rsquo;s girls gone missing as well. And a new (old) vampire from out of town come visiting. All at the same time?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, things are bound to get interesting&amp;ndash;all together perhaps my favorite book of the series thus far.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Black Mirror: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/17/black-mirror-season-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/17/black-mirror-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Been meaning to watch this for years. Finally got around to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting; especially for only have three episodes in the first season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="#1-the-national-anthem">The first episode&lt;/a> is kind of weird and by far the least &amp;lsquo;sci-fi&amp;rsquo; of the bunch&amp;ndash;this could happen now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="#2-fifteen-million-merits">The second&lt;/a> though starts out as fairly straight forward near future dystopia and then goes &lt;em>dark&lt;/em> from there. I like it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And &lt;a href="#3-the-entire-history-of-you">the third&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;take a concept (recording everything), apply the concept to imperfect (honestly fairly terrible) people and see what breaks. It&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to season 2!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Last Star</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/17/the-last-star/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/17/the-last-star/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s always been this way&amp;hellip; We bear the unbearable. We endure the unendurable. We do what must be done until we ourselves are undone.
Whelp. That&amp;rsquo;s where The 5th Wave ends. Honestly, the first book was really quite good. The second was fine. And the third was &amp;hellip; marginally better?
But really, the ending kind of came out of left field, we got too much and not enough of the alien invaders all at the same time, and &amp;hellip; other than (mostly) Ringer, I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly care about what happens next to any of the protagonists.</description></item><item><title>Blood Trade</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/14/blood-trade/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/14/blood-trade/</guid><description>&lt;p>Onward in Jane&amp;rsquo;s ever increasing trials and tribulations in the world(s) of the VAMPIRES!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the upside, I really love Jane&amp;rsquo;s new found family in Eli and the Kid. It&amp;rsquo;s great to have someone close to her that she can rely on more directly than all the on again off again allies, potential lovers (as screwed up as many of those are), and other relationships she&amp;rsquo;s had through the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“And we don’t give a rat’s ass that you’re a skinwalker,” the Kid added. I heard the slap on the back of his head, and my smile went even wider. He’d braved a head slap to reassure me in that gutsy, bigmouthed way teenaged boys have. “As long as you don’t shift and get hungry enough to think about us as dinner. ’Cause, like, that would, like, totally suck.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>On another upside, it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to dig more into Jane&amp;rsquo;s more recent past. Not hundreds of years ago when she was born (still needing more of that), but her life as a child and a few into her badass (if lonely) way of dealing with all of that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worldbuildingwise, the Vampires continue to get more complicated. Bruiser is an Onario now? Whatever that is. Sounds neat. And whatever Soul actually is? More of that please! For whatever reason, I like injections of weird, unique things in urban fantasy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the downside, relationship drama. She &lt;em>really&lt;/em> needs to get over Rick. That&amp;rsquo;s not an option (for now). Just move on. Bruiser would be great. Leo (relationshipwise) is a whole heaping mess and I hope that&amp;rsquo;s not a serious option. Or any of the other men, really. Just&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s been six books. Move on already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a fun adventure and I really look forward to what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen next!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Origins of The Wheel of Time: The Legends and Mythologies that Inspired Robert Jordan</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/14/origins-of-the-wheel-of-time-the-legends-and-mythologies-that-inspired-robert-jordan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/14/origins-of-the-wheel-of-time-the-legends-and-mythologies-that-inspired-robert-jordan/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-wheel-of-time/">The Wheel of Time&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Robert Jordan built an absolutely wonderful world.

&lt;p>That’s the cost. That’s the price. Get ready, because when you crush the humanity out of humans, you’re left with humans with no humanity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/10/the-5th-wave/">The 5th Wave&lt;/a> had an interesting premise with a lot of potential: alien spaceship shows up; 4 waves of death and destruction kill 99.99% of humanity. This is the story of all that unfolding, plus what happens next.&lt;/p>

I really enjoyed &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/14/loki/">Season 1&lt;/a>. No idea if they could top it. And I&amp;rsquo;m still not 100% sure if they made it better, but they most certainly made it weirder. And I&amp;rsquo;m here for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cast is great of course, with Tom Hiddleston&amp;rsquo;s Loki carrying the show. I really did quite enjoy Jonathan Majors&amp;rsquo; new double role as He Who Remains but also now as Victor Timely. That&amp;rsquo;s most certainly something&amp;ndash;and makes me wonder if they can/could have actually pulled it all off, depending on if Majors sticks around in the MCU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I mentioned in &lt;a href="#6-glorious-purpose">the last episode review below&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s a crazy show, and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to like about it. It could really change everything&amp;hellip; but I have the unfortunate feeling they&amp;rsquo;re not going to let it. We shall have to see!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After the 1st wave, only darkness remains.&lt;br>
After the 2nd, only the lucky escape.&lt;br>
And after the 3rd, only the unlucky survive.&lt;br>
After the 4th wave, only one rule applies: trust no one.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the world (as we know it). The aliens came and killed off most of humanity&amp;ndash;in some actually fairly interesting ways. This is the story of what comes next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first, it&amp;rsquo;s the story of Cassie after the end of the world. How she survives each wave (not told in order), how things keep getting worse, and then finally how she starts to find some &lt;em>other&lt;/em> survivors.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“I would kill for a cheeseburger. Honestly. If I stumbled across someone eating a cheeseburger, I would kill them for it.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But then we start getting a few more points of view. More survivors and their own stories of death. Child soldiers. Human* survivors every bit as bad as the aliens. A possible look into what comes next.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Edgin: We must never stop failing, because the minute we do, we&amp;rsquo;ve failed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s such a fun movie. It takes the delightful chaos of an idolized Dungeons and Dragons session, leans hard into the worldbuilding of the Forgotten Realms (without strictly requiring you know anything about it); and cranks up the visuals up to 11.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s gobs of humor, some pretty crazy action scenes, and a big &amp;rsquo;evil skybeam&amp;rsquo; action scene that every movie nowdays seems to have. Really, there are just so many great individual scenes. The initial view of the prison&amp;ndash;and the prison break. Fighting a certain dragon. Asking exactly five questions of the dead (it goes exactly as you&amp;rsquo;d expect).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The characters and casting were really quite fun too. Chris Pine&amp;rsquo;s Edgin the bard really sells teh movie, but I loved the over the top paladin feel of Regé-Jean Page&amp;rsquo;s Xenk and Daisy Head&amp;rsquo;s bonkers Sofina. Michelle Rodriguez as a barbarian? Yes please. Hugh Grant as Hugh Grant? A delightful surprise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s great. Give it a watch.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Xenk: You may have forsworn your oath, but your oath hasn&amp;rsquo;t forsworn you.&lt;br>
&amp;hellip;&lt;br>
Edgin: Just because that sentence is symmetrical, it doesn’t make it not nonsense.&lt;/p>

Really, if you made it this far, you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to love Season 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Boys are (still) out to deal with Homelander&amp;hellip; and they may just have found the weapon to do it. Only this time the solution is perhaps eve more expensive than the cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Homelander is really the (wonderful terrible) heart of the show. Anthony Starr is amazing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have a few new supes running around (in secret). And all sorts of ones we knew about doing even more terrible and deprived things in general.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And in the end, the more things change, the more things stay the same. But worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to Season 4.

&lt;p>Abe Kalotay died in his front yard in late February, beneath a sky so pale it seemed infected. There was a wintery wet snowbite to the still air and the sprawled-open pages of the book at his side had grown slightly damp by the time his daughter Joanna came home and found his body lying in the grass by their long dirt driveway.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s quite the opening. Such beautiful language for something so dark. Which really sums up the book in a lot of ways.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thornhedge</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/28/thornhedge/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/28/thornhedge/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another day, another Kingfisher. And once again, I quite enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time, we have a novella length story that takes Rapunzel and turns it more than a bit sideways. As the blurb says:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a princess trapped in a tower. This isn&amp;rsquo;t her story.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Instead, we get Toadling. Raised by the fae with the power to turn into a frog and some other minor magics of her own, she ends up standing guard over a girl in a tower for years and years&amp;ndash;centuries really, it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely clear; nor does it particularly matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I quite enjoyed the different take on the story&amp;ndash;I do love a good fairy story. I enjoyed the character of Toadling. The idea of the bramble and a gift gone awry. Not a huge fan of the idea of straight up pure evil in general and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work any better here (spoilers I suppose?). But it&amp;rsquo;s a small enough part of the story that I don&amp;rsquo;t think it particularly detracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good book. A quick read. Worth it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rule of Wolves</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/27/rule-of-wolves/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/27/rule-of-wolves/</guid><description>&lt;p>I hate it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, not the book, I actually quite liked the book. It&amp;rsquo;s never an easy task to bring together as many different plotlines as you have when you&amp;rsquo;re the second book of the third series set in the same world&amp;ndash;and I think Bardugo did it well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, I hate that one particular death in this book. They did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> have to die.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which I suppose means that it worked? Except&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t really feel like it changed anything, other than to annoy me, the reader. So it goes I suppose.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Secret Invasion</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/26/secret-invasion/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/26/secret-invasion/</guid><description>&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s fine. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see some spy stories in the MCU, even if they&amp;rsquo;re light on the spy stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s great to have Fury again, even if (in hindsight) I was perfectly fine without knowing more about Fury&amp;rsquo;s backstory. And the introduction of Super Skrulls? Well, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really need that in the MCU. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t a fan of it in either of the previous story lines I&amp;rsquo;ve read them in (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/13/ultimate-fantastic-four-volume-6-frightful/">Ultimate Fantastic Four&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/04/runaways-vol.-8-dead-end-kids/">Runaways&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But you know what I really think bothers me about the Skrull? All through the Infinity Saga, we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to believe they&amp;rsquo;ve been here, working with Fury. And we never heard even a hint about them. I get it. They’re shapeshifters. The perfect secret agents. Still weird to add something like this after 15 years&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If it had been something tied into each movie and show, leading up to an event (like the Infinity Saga), it could have worked. As it is, it really feels like the concept of an MCU is working against them here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Boys: Season 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/26/the-boys-season-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/26/the-boys-season-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Managed to get away for a bit since [[The Boys: Season 1|season 1]]; sometimes life happens (but not for everyone in the Boys&amp;hellip;). But I finally made it through season 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man this is a violent bloody show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s still quite the exploration for &amp;lsquo;what if superheroes were real&amp;hellip; and terrible&amp;rsquo; that really draws you in, but now with more terrible corporations. And Nazis. Because of course we had to go there. It actually works really well, the conflict of benefiting from Nazi science is a &lt;em>big deal&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still really enjoy (in a twisted way) how terrifying Antony Starr plays Homelander. If he goes off the rails, what &lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> are you going to do to stop him?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus show Hughie (really all of the &amp;rsquo;the Boys&amp;rsquo;) is far better than his comic counterpart. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see him well out of his comfort zone, both in relationships (especially with Starlight) and all the madcap shenanigans Butcher&amp;rsquo;s gang gets up to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, mostly Nazis, but Compound V not only getting revealed the the characters, but also going public? We haven&amp;rsquo;t nearly seen the ramifications of that. Hoping to see more of &lt;em>that&lt;/em> in Season 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, great show. Very much deserves the R rating. Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 7: Unbound Force</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/26/darth-vader-vol.-7-unbound-force/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/26/darth-vader-vol.-7-unbound-force/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v7-textbundle-bfbe5d.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Walk softly and carry a big stick. Or stomp loudly and carry enough firepower to start a small war. Whatever worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so continues the saga of Jane Yellowrock (and Beast!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, there&amp;rsquo;s a vampire plague, a new (old) vampire making a play for territory, and Jane accidentally making promises she certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean to&amp;ndash;and perhaps starting a war for her troubles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was a day that would be remembered all her life by Jehane bet Ishak, the physician, for reasons over and above those of her fellow citizens in that proud, notoriously rebellious town: she lost her urine flask in the afternoon, and a part of her heart forever before the moons had set. The flask, for reasons of family history, was not a trivial matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That is a dense book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have a land in turmoil, warring city states, religious fervor, and the potential (perhaps a bit more than that) of a looming holy war.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Time and steady governance would bring Jad back into Al-Rassan, the king had declared, not burnings and destruction. Ibero wasn’t entirely sure how that meshed with holy doctrine, but he kept silent in the N

We had our fun with Kaz and crew in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/">Six of Crows&lt;/a>. And now we shift focus once again, back to Ravka.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In some ways, it&amp;rsquo;s a continuation of the storyline of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a>, following the new King Nikolai as he deals with securing his throne in a nation deeply in debt with enemies on all sides. Plus, we get a lot more Zoya (who I did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> expect to like as much as I did) and at least some more of Genya and David (I do love their relationship).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another fascinating aspect of that storyline is that we get to dig much more into the mystical/religious underpinnings of the world. Six of Crows never really went there, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely something that came up in Shadow and Bone. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to feel like you know how magic works in the world&amp;ndash;and then realizing that you know nothing after all&amp;hellip; (both as a reader and as the characters).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will warn though: this part got &lt;em>weird&lt;/em>. All sorts of new and interesting (or I suppose old and interesting) metaphysics and magic we hadn&amp;rsquo;t really dug into before. A bit jarring&amp;ndash;both for the reader and for the characters involved&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a completely different direction, we also have a main storyline with Nina from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/">Six of Crows&lt;/a> (of all the characters, hers isn&amp;rsquo;t the first story I would have chosen to continue, but it is interesting). She&amp;rsquo;s still messed up / something new and now she&amp;rsquo;s off to Fjerda to continue to try to save the world. Newcomer Hanna is a lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a solid book. It&amp;rsquo;s weird how disjoint the two storylines are&amp;ndash;they don&amp;rsquo;t really interact at all, although I see how they&amp;rsquo;ll likely come together in [[todo:Rule of Wolves]]. I kept finding myself annoyed when we switch from one to another.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Downton Abbey</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/14/downton-abbey/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/14/downton-abbey/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Royal Family comes to Downton Abbey.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s basically a film length episode of Downton Abbey. And that&amp;rsquo;s not a bad thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think I would have preferred it stay on the small screen, but if that isn&amp;rsquo;t in the cards, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to at least have a chance to have one last* (grand) hurrah for the characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 5: The Shadow's Shadow</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/12/darth-vader-vol.-5-the-shadows-shadow/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/12/darth-vader-vol.-5-the-shadows-shadow/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sabe!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It seems the Handmaidens freed a number of former slaves from Tattooine. Including some familiar very minor characters from episode 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A great way to… blackmail Vader into doing a good thing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v5-textbundle-f081b2.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For all Vader touts order over chaos… he certainly does have a flair for shaking things up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also: an ‘artificial life force draining storm’ is so very Star Wars sounding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a fine story. Interesting to see the complexity Vader is struggling with even now/then.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Wheel of Time: Season 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/09/the-wheel-of-time-season-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/09/the-wheel-of-time-season-2/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Wheel of Time turns, and ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of time. But it was a beginning.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/23/the-wheel-of-time-season-1/">The Wheel of Time: Season 1&lt;/a> had a lot of potential&amp;hellip; and also a lot of issues. Especially when it came to the last couple episodes. COVID, sure. A main actor leaving, I get it. But it&amp;rsquo;s still a rough ending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it was with cautious optimism, we approached Season 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s very much a new turning of the wheel. Some things they changed really do work well. It&amp;rsquo;s not the books, but it&amp;rsquo;s a new story in the same world. Some&amp;hellip; less so. But not everything is perfect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things I loved:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The casting. Ishamael was great in Season 1 and even better in Season 2. Lanfear is a great counter to him. Aviendha and Elayne fit really well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It bears repeating: Ishamael and Lanfear are great. Leaning a bit more into terrifying even than the books, which quite frankly they needed. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see (and hope they don&amp;rsquo;t screw up&amp;hellip;) the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Almost&lt;/em> everything about the Seanchan. They feel &amp;lsquo;off&amp;rsquo; in just the right way. The one exception&amp;hellip; the Damane pacifiers. I really don&amp;rsquo;t get that &lt;em>at all&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Liandrin. She&amp;rsquo;s still terrible, but I really like how they turned up the &lt;em>reason&lt;/em> why she is as she is. And she&amp;rsquo;s quite the actor to pull it off.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Things that I did not:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The ending. Check out the &lt;a href="#8-what-was-meant-to-be">individual review&lt;/a> for more details, but &amp;hellip; this wasn&amp;rsquo;t any better than the previous season. And they don&amp;rsquo;t even have unexpected troubles to deal with. I&amp;rsquo;m starting to feel they really just don&amp;rsquo;t know how to write endings&amp;hellip; which is weird.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Anyways, other than a few things, I quite enjoyed it. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to Season 3. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 4: Crimson Reign</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/09/darth-vader-vol.-4-crimson-reign/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/09/darth-vader-vol.-4-crimson-reign/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v4-textbundle-6d8ec1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So forget Luke and Han Vader is apparently going after this Crimson Dawn now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v4-textbundle-99b49e.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They’re everywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Should be right up Vader’s alley.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add to that the return of Sabe. It’s an unexpectedly interesting way to tie into Vader’s past. One just had to wonder if/&lt;em>when&lt;/em> she’ll learn the truth of Vader’s identity…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still not quite as good as the first two volumes but an enjoyable read nevertheless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On thing I particularly enjoy about the comics is just how varied and alien the universe can feel:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v4-textbundle-5f40a5.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a nice contrast to how human centric the movies and shows have to be. Easier to draw a bug/lizard/ten foot ball droid than to put them on film.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 3: War of the Bounty Hunters</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/darth-vader-vol.-3-war-of-the-bounty-hunters/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/darth-vader-vol.-3-war-of-the-bounty-hunters/</guid><description>&lt;p>Vader is after Solo now…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v3-textbundle-a96877.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With some interesting “allies”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus an appearance by the one and only (I assume) IG-88!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Coolest part:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v3-textbundle-e568a4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vader getting &lt;del>hacked&lt;/del> sliced! He’s ‘more machine now than man’ so it fits. They could have done so much more with it…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The introduction (for me at least) of the Crimson Dawn is interesting as well. A Million Stronger than One. A neat idea to contrast the ‘only two there are’ Sith and the Big Damn Heroes of the Rebellion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit more out there than the previous two volumes but I enjoyed it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Raven Cursed</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/raven-cursed/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/raven-cursed/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>The Emperor was not thrilled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So he tears Vader apart over again, sends him back to Mustafar (planet of his both in a way), and forbids him the force.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things only get more epic from here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a whirlwind of Vader passing test after trial, showing off just why he’s one of the most powerful beings in the Galaxy. Until we return to Exegol—2 years after the Rise of Skywalker; trying to fill in some of the mess that one made of continuity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vader is a weird choice for a protagonist, but likewise weirdly compelling. He is (at this point) unabashedly evil, yet I find myself rooting for him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 1: Dark Heart of the Sith</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/05/darth-vader-vol.-1-dark-heart-of-the-sith/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/05/darth-vader-vol.-1-dark-heart-of-the-sith/</guid><description>&lt;p>Darth Vader, shortly after Luke escapes him in The Empire Strikes Back.

&lt;p>It’s a fascinating look into Vader forced to dig into Anakin’s past. On Tattoine. On—and under—Naboo. Work the Handmaidens and other from Padme’s life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fascinating mix. I’m curious where it goes next!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“Crows remember human faces. They remember the people who feed them, who are kind to them. And the people who wrong them too. They don’t forget. They tell each other who to look after and who to watch out for.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/">Six of Crows&lt;/a> took the world of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> and instead gave us one heck of a heist book. Really, it all circled around one big, impossible heist. Plan everything, get in, plans fall apart, make new plans, and pull off the impossible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s one heck of an impressive book and I really enjoyed it, but it left an awful lot of plot thread hanging open&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which makes Crooked Kingdom all the more cathartic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Six of Crows</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>No mourners.&lt;br>
No funerals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Among them, it passed for &amp;lsquo;good luck.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s such a good book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It takes the world of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> and completely ignores the at times overly YA political and religions machinations of that particular trilogy in favor of a somewhat darker and grittier heist novel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the most part, you really don&amp;rsquo;t need to have read Shadow and Bone first. There are a few references to the &amp;lsquo;Ravkan Civil War&amp;rsquo; and even to Sankta Alina, but other than that, it&amp;rsquo;s a new world. There are still Grisha, but they&amp;rsquo;re far less &amp;lsquo;miliary&amp;rsquo;, instead using (and hiding) their powers in all manner of interesting ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And while the heist elements were &lt;em>strong&lt;/em> (an impossible job, planning going absolutely sideways, and double triple crossing left and right) we also get all sorts of interesting backstory. Each of the main characters has chapters in their voice, but in the action going now, and explaining how they got into this mess in the first place. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot, but in a good way!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One gotcha is that, while the main heist plot is more than adequately contained in the book, it very much is the first half of a duology. It managed to just make me want to read the second&amp;hellip; but don&amp;rsquo;t go into this looking for a stand alone novel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what really shines are the characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dead Man Logan, Vol. 1: Sins of the Father</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/26/dead-man-logan-vol.-1-sins-of-the-father/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/26/dead-man-logan-vol.-1-sins-of-the-father/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so he has an expiration date:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Downton Abbey Season 6 is a strange beast. On one hand, we have what feels all the cast pairing off, sometimes with long known relationships and in the cast of the Family with guys we only met in the previous season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For what it&amp;rsquo;s worth, I &lt;em>still&lt;/em> do not really understand the relationship between Mary and Henry. I think it&amp;rsquo;s mostly Mary. She certainly ebbs and flows&amp;hellip; but wow she&amp;rsquo;s a (sorry, but Edith says it too) bitch at times. On the other hand, Edith and Bertie? Delightful. If expected for the chaos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, the world is moving on. Is Downton Abbey going to survive? With reductions in expected staff and families around the world failing, it&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But with all those relationships &lt;em>wow&lt;/em> do the last few episodes blitz through what feels like every plotline possible in only a few hours. I do wonder if they thought they&amp;rsquo;d have a 7th season. But so it goes. For the most part, everything is tied off neatly. And for everything else&amp;hellip; apparently there are two movies?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a final note, if you&amp;rsquo;ve been lamenting the torture the writers have put the Bates&amp;rsquo; through over the year&amp;hellip; well, they&amp;rsquo;re not quite done. But there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad for that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I quite enjoyed it. Much more than I expected to, as I seem to say with all non-SF/F shows I end up watching. Still not something I would have chosen, still quite enjoyable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Betsy-Tacy and Tib</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/25/betsy-tacy-and-tib/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 20:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/25/betsy-tacy-and-tib/</guid><description>&lt;p>Betsy-Tacy and Tib is &amp;hellip; pretty much exactly what you&amp;rsquo;d expect. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/05/betsy-tacy/">Betsy-Tacy&lt;/a>, but now with more Tib. A new girl moves in, they become instant best friends, hijinks ensue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once again, it&amp;rsquo;s a delightful book to read with my own little one. I enjoy seeing what messes the children get into. And although they do get in trouble from time to time, we&amp;rsquo;re reminded that &lt;em>it&amp;rsquo;s okay to be children&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: my absolute favorite story is when they decide to cook. It goes as well as one might expect! 😄&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
