&lt;p>We have:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-next-doctor">The Next Doctor&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Where the Doctor meets&amp;hellip; the Doctor?!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p> Jackson Lake: There she is. My transport through time and space. The TARDIS!&lt;br>
 The Doctor: You&amp;rsquo;ve got a balloon.&lt;br>
 Jackson Lake: TARDIS. T - A - R - D - I - S. It stands for Tethered Aerial Release Developed in Style! Do you see?&lt;br>
 The Doctor: Well, I do now. I like it. Good TARDIS.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And you know? Dervla Kirwan as Miss Hartigan gets a bit of flack, but if you ignore for a moment the history of the &lt;span class="spoiler">Cybermen&lt;/span>
, she&amp;rsquo;s quite the fun row. Plus, an absolutely giant robot in old fashioned london down. What&amp;rsquo;s not to love?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="planet-of-the-dead">Planet of the Dead&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Doctor, sent through a portal to a desert planet, where he has to depend on a temporary companion in jewel thief Lady Christina to get back home.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Christina: It&amp;rsquo;s Christina Da Souza. To be precise it&amp;rsquo;s Lady Christina Da Souza.&lt;br>
The Doctor: Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s handy because I&amp;rsquo;m a lord.&lt;br>
Christina: Seriously, lord of where?&lt;br>
The Doctor: It&amp;rsquo;s quite a big estate.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s yet another case (Voyage of the Damned was another one) where a companion for a special would have been &lt;em>fascinating&lt;/em> to keep around. So it goes though.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-waters-of-mars">The Waters of Mars&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Fixed points in time don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>really&lt;/em> make sense for the Doctor. Especially given how it turns out in the end. But still, a giant marsbase and soggy zombies? What&amp;rsquo;s not to love?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it&amp;rsquo;s yet another one of those episodes that digs just into how broken and&amp;ndash;at some level&amp;ndash;insane the Doctor is, after all those years and triumphs. And failures.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Adelaide: But you said we die. For the future. For the human race!&lt;br>
The Doctor: Yes, because there are laws. There are laws of time. Once upon a time there were people in charge of those laws but they died. They all died. Do you know who that leaves? &lt;em>Me!&lt;/em> It&amp;rsquo;s taken me all these years to realize that the laws of time are &lt;em>mine&lt;/em> and they will obey me!&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Quite the set up for&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-end-of-time-parts-one-and-two">The End of Time (Parts One and Two)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Tennats finale is coming&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Doctor: Even if I change it still feels like dying. Everything I am dies. Some new man goes sauntering away&amp;hellip; and I&amp;rsquo;m dead.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But on the way, we have Wilfred Mott as the Doctor&amp;rsquo;s companion? Yes please.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Doctor: I&amp;rsquo;m going to die.&lt;br>
Wilfred Mott: Well, so am I one day.&lt;br>
The Doctor: Don&amp;rsquo;t you dare!&lt;br>
Wilfred Mott: Alright, I&amp;rsquo;ll try not to.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And add to that, the Master (back from he dead) and perhaps&amp;hellip; something even worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh that&amp;rsquo;s an intense pair of episodes. Even if it&amp;rsquo;s more than a &lt;em>touch&lt;/em> overdone at times (as all of ennats finales seem to be).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this time around, we get a victory lap of sorts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And so Ten ends.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Doctor: I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>On to Eleven!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doctor Who: Season 4</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/12/21/doctor-who-season-4/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/12/21/doctor-who-season-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh Doctor Who.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This such a wonderful season (and I do say that about a lot of the seasons).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First off, we have Donna back as the companion. I do love that she&amp;rsquo;s not pining after the Doctor as others have been want to do. And she&amp;rsquo;s just so delightfully snarkily&amp;ndash;human. They really do play off each other well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, we have &lt;em>The Fires of Pompeii&lt;/em>, with both a future Doctor and a future companion (in other rolls), &lt;em>Planet of the Ood&lt;/em> (delightfully creepy), &lt;em>The Doctor&amp;rsquo;s Daughter&lt;/em> (actually his wife&amp;hellip;), &lt;em>Silence in the Library&lt;/em> (well, okay maybe she is), and &lt;em>Midnight&lt;/em> (for such a limited set it&amp;rsquo;s so intense).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are just so many solid episodes this season!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward, to the 2008-2010 specials! Man those can be a pain to find/categorize. I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure why they weren&amp;rsquo;t just considered season 4.5 or even season 5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lost: Season 4</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/12/17/lost-season-4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/12/17/lost-season-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Survival. Mysteries. The Others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now, just possibly&amp;hellip; rescue?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, as they said in the end of the previous season, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>not Penny&amp;rsquo;s boat&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So who&amp;rsquo;s is it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really enjoy this season. We get a chance to have some new characters (from the freighter come to rescue them), a bit of a shake up in terms of who&amp;rsquo;s on which side on th island, and a whole pile of &amp;lsquo;what is even going on&amp;rsquo;, split a bit between Desmond and newcomer Daniel Faraday&amp;ndash;I do enjoy his character.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, we really are starting to get into the point where you question &amp;lsquo;so&amp;hellip; were they planning that all along? do even the &lt;em>writers&lt;/em> know what&amp;rsquo;s going on?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure the answer is no? That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s a bad season though!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And, because of the 2008 writer&amp;rsquo;s strike, it&amp;rsquo;s a shorter season as well&amp;gt; Ramps of the tension that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Favorite episodes this season?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first flashes off the island&amp;ndash;with their own level of *you did &lt;strong>what&lt;/strong> now. &lt;em>The Constant&lt;/em>, with timey-whimey shenanigans and &lt;em>There&amp;rsquo;s No Place Like Home&lt;/em>, with everything coming to a tense, sometimes magical, and always chaotic end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting seeing Lost straddle the line between science fiction and more supernatural/fantasy. I tend to like the former, but a lot of times, it&amp;rsquo;s the contrast that really does the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only two seasons left!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lost: Season 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/11/30/lost-season-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/11/30/lost-season-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Season 1 was all about surviving on the island.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Season 2 was all about mysteries. More survivors. The Hatch. A monster made of smoke.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now we get Season 3: All about the Others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, what a season that was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We learn how they live in several different guises, from the cages of &lt;em>A Tale of Two Cities&lt;/em> to the village/barracks of &lt;em>Stranger in a Strange Land&lt;/em>, to a sort of mass exodus.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Tom: Hey, you got yourself a fish biscuit! How&amp;rsquo;d you do that?&lt;br>
Sawyer: Figured out your complicated gizmos, thats how.&lt;br>
Tom: It only took the bears two hours.&lt;br>
[Sawyer contemplates briefly]&lt;br>
Sawyer: How many of &amp;rsquo;em were there?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>All sorts of medical madness, in &lt;em>Every Man for Himself&lt;/em> and pretty much anything with Juliet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that all, one character who &lt;em>really&lt;/em> goes through an arc this season is Locke. He&amp;rsquo;s lost his way&amp;hellip; only to find it again. And lose it. And find another. Oh Locke. You&amp;rsquo;re so very interesting, but also so hard to actually root for&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sayid: Kate, if you were looking for help to find Jack, why didn&amp;rsquo;t you ask us?&lt;br>
Kate: Two reasons: you don&amp;rsquo;t know where to look and you&amp;rsquo;re not motivated. And I don&amp;rsquo;t blame you. Why would you want to go on another trek across the island, risk more lives just to get Jack back?&lt;br>
Locke: You&amp;rsquo;re wrong.&lt;br>
Kate: Oh, really? They why didn&amp;rsquo;t you come after-&lt;br>
Locke: Not about the motivation, just about knowing where to look. We got a compass bearing, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure if we follow it, it&amp;rsquo;ll lead us right to &amp;rsquo;em.&lt;br>
Kate: How?&lt;br>
Sayid: Because of the way the sunlight hit Mr. Eko&amp;rsquo;s stick&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Perhaps my continued favorite though? Desmond. Wakes up naked. Wakes up in his flat. Wakes up and buys a ring. Oh, he&amp;rsquo;s got a complicated life, both on the island and off of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Desmond Hume: See you in another life, brother.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>On a less positive note, we have main-character-who-have-obviously-been-there-all-along Nikki and Paulo. I mean, it worked well enough for Desmond and seems to be working okay for Juliet. So why not someone else? But they come out of nowhere and get all &lt;em>Expose&lt;/em>d by the end. So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All that&amp;hellip; to go &lt;em>Through the Looking Glass&lt;/em>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man, this is a fun show.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lost: Season 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/10/30/lost-season-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/10/30/lost-season-2/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>John Locke: [screaming] What am I supposed to do?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so my third watch of Lost continues!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Season 1 was all about the crash on the island. About survival, with only the beginnings of weirdness around the edges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Season 2? Now we&amp;rsquo;re really getting into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;em>Orientation&lt;/em>, we get our first hints of the Hatch. Desmond is such a fun character, even if (&lt;em>spoilers&lt;/em>!) he&amp;rsquo;s not in as much of this seasons as later ones. And oh, later on, we have &lt;em>Lockdown&lt;/em>. Now &lt;em>that&lt;/em> is a wonderful mystery of an episode. And the whole season does have an excellent dynamic between Jack and Locke. Man of Science. Man of Faith. (And really, which is which?)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>John Locke: Why do you find it so hard to believe?!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jack Shephard: Why do you find it so easy?!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>John Locke: It&amp;rsquo;s never been easy!&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We get a few new characters from the tail section (&lt;em>The Other 48 Days&lt;/em>). Mr. Eko is such an intense foil to Locke in particular. And the&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We do also get two amazing Hugo backstory centered episodes: &lt;em>Everybody Hates Hugo&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Dave&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Hugo: Did either of you see a bald guy in slippers with a coconut come through here?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charlie: No. But I did see a polar bear on roller skates with a mango.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>He&amp;rsquo;s such a fun character, in spite (because?) of everything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;em>Maternity Leave&lt;/em>, we get a bit more about the medical mystery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then in the end&amp;hellip; we &lt;em>Live Together, Die Alone&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to Season 3!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doctor Who: Season 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/10/16/doctor-who-season-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/10/16/doctor-who-season-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so I slowly continue re-watching Doctor Who.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It starts out strong with Jadoon on the Moon in &lt;a href="#1-smith-and-jones">Smith and Jones&lt;/a>, we have more of the Face of Bo (&lt;a href="#3-gridlock">Gridlock&lt;/a>) and the Daleks (&lt;a href="#4-daleks-in-manhattan">Daleks in Manhattan&lt;/a>; plus, that one has Andrew Garfield!), several wonderfully creepy episodes (&lt;a href="#7-42">42&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="#9-the-family-of-blood">Family of Blood&lt;/a>), and a finale that was certainly spectacular even if it finally veered too much &amp;lsquo;magic&amp;rsquo; and not enough science for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and of course this is the one with &lt;a href="#10-blink">Blink&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a reason this is the highest rated Doctor Who episode from the revival&amp;ndash;despite minimal time with the Doctor himself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A solid season. And now it&amp;rsquo;s time for Donna!&lt;/p>
&lt;hr></description></item><item><title>Lost: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/10/07/lost-season-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/10/07/lost-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man this show was huge when it first came out. I watched it then and once since, so this will be my third watch. And this time around I&amp;rsquo;m watching it with someone who (somehow) has never seen it before. To experience all the twists and turns anew with someone? Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first season is awesome. We don&amp;rsquo;t get quite as much mystery and the larger story as later seasons&amp;ndash;but that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we need. Instead, the first season is all about survival&amp;ndash;they did just crash onto a island far &lt;em>far&lt;/em> away from land after all&amp;ndash;and introducing our cast. And oh, they did that in spades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Pilot was, of course&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> awesome. And I do love the first season giving each main character a flashback episode. Locke&amp;rsquo;s (Walkabout) in particular was quite a twist. And oh Hurley&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love the characters. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing, with a main cast of over a dozen, how they managed to give each of them (well, most of them) their own over the top backstories and room to breath. I suppose part of that is a side effect of an older style TV season&amp;ndash;when you have over 20 episodes, you have room to actually &lt;em>build&lt;/em> to something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jack is great, even if he&amp;rsquo;s got entirely too much of the perfect &amp;lsquo;Doctor savior&amp;rsquo; personality at times. Kate is great, even when she can&amp;rsquo;t stop running. Sawyer is great&amp;ndash;you love to hate him, but he might just be a good man under all that. Locke is a great mystery all around. Hurley is just great. Full stop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s not to say I don&amp;rsquo;t like the rest of the characters on the island. There&amp;rsquo;s isn&amp;rsquo;t a main cast member in the first season that I don&amp;rsquo;t find worth watching&amp;ndash;and some of them still have room to grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise, I love the slow burn introduction of &amp;lsquo;what is even going &lt;em>on&lt;/em> on this Island&amp;rsquo;. Monsters in the woods, mysterious noises, hidden structures. It has it all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And just when they get a chance to leave&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hacks: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/15/hacks-season-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/15/hacks-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well. That is most definitely a show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ava is an entitled 25 year old with basically no filter. Deborah Vance is Las Vegas comedian that might just be at the end of her career (certainly not by choice).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now they have to work together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some hilarious moments in this show. And I do really love Jean Smart as Deborah Vance. Hannah Einbinder as Ava Daniels is &lt;em>so&lt;/em> cringe at times (no filter!), but &lt;em>that&amp;rsquo;s the point&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the dynamic between the two is &lt;em>fascinating&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carl Clemons-Hopkins as Marcus provides quite the B plot as very gay and very much running things for Deborah.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally Paul W. Downs as Jimmy and Megan Stalter as Kayla&amp;hellip; I could do with less of that. I guess you have to have someone keeping things moving?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s, I think, a show surprisingly worth watching. Onward to season 2!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Severance: Season 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/24/severance-season-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/24/severance-season-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whelp. They certainly turned &lt;em>that&lt;/em> up a notch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right at the end of Season 1, the innies get a chance to go out. This could not &lt;em>possibly&lt;/em> go well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except apparently all is well in the world?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have drama, both innie and outie and mixed. We have goats. We have sex scenes. We have wives cheating with their own husbands. We have a trip into the woods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we have a marching band.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I quite enjoyed this show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now I have to wait for season 3!!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Severance: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/25/severance-season-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/25/severance-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, that&amp;rsquo;s quite a show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first glance, the idea is appealing. You split your memories so that you can go to work, get paid, and essentially spend your entire life &lt;em>not at work&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But then you start to think about this other you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They never leave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They never sleep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They never have a life outside of work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;ndash;is terrifying enough even before you start getting into the whole cult&amp;rsquo;y aspects. And the hallways. And the goats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have no idea where they&amp;rsquo;re going&amp;ndash;(I hope they know)&amp;ndash;but I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Taskmaster Australia: Series 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/02/taskmaster-australia-series-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/02/taskmaster-australia-series-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have no idea how I ended up watching season 2 of Taskmaster Australia before Season 1, but go with it! It&amp;rsquo;s not like there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>that&lt;/em> much of an overarching plot between seasons that you have to keep up with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And man, this is a fun bit. Another series, another Taskmaster! And another assistant!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tom (Gleeson). And lesser Tom (Cashman) are a lot of fun together. I love that lesser Tom can never keep a straight face when teh contestants screw up. It&amp;rsquo;s delightful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And oh the cast was a lot of fun. Anne and Lloyd as a couple on the show together made for some great moments. Wil and Tom being old friends is a dynamic we&amp;rsquo;ve seen before in the British version but it&amp;rsquo;s always fun. Josh was quite a wildcard at times. And Jenny was one of the reasons I came to this version of the show&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen her acts on YouTube before and she&amp;rsquo;s a wonderfully weird mix and has a lot of those &amp;lsquo;young enough to make the other contestants feel old&amp;rsquo; moments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, another great season of Taskmaster. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to catch more of the Australian version! LIke season 1 &amp;#x1f604;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Agatha All Along</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/21/agatha-all-along/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/21/agatha-all-along/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh that was a delight. Take Agatha (and the general fallout of her created world) from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/19/wandavision/">WandaVision&lt;/a>, turn up the witchiness, and go on a magical mystical, somewhat terrifying adventure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating story and, honestly, if you would have left out a few scenes it would have worked perfectly well completely outside of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well. And at this point, that&amp;rsquo;s a strong point in its favor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man Kathryn Hawn does great in this. I loved the supporting witch cast, especially Aubrey Plaza. She does unsettling and off kilter so well. And Teen&amp;ndash;he was an interesting counterpoint. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about the worldbuilding around either Rio (Plaza) or Teen (Locke), those parts felt weird, but the actors were awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course&amp;hellip; &lt;strong>the song&lt;/strong> (I don&amp;rsquo;t see this version as spoilers, but some might).&lt;/p>

 &lt;iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VnjYeJ5blxo?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video">&lt;/iframe>
 &lt;/div>

&lt;p>Man that song has been stuck in my head for weeks now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I personally would have dropped the last half of the last episode, the penultimate really works better as a conclusion. This really doesn&amp;rsquo;t need a sequel (although apparently there will be a third show as a &amp;lsquo;TV trilogy&amp;rsquo; sort of thing?), but so it goes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Man on the Inside</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/05/a-man-on-the-inside/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/05/a-man-on-the-inside/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that was a fun show. Created by the Michael Schur (who also did the Good Place, check it out!) and with many overlapping cast members from the Good Place, I had high hopes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I learned that it was about a man learning to live in an assisted living center, I &amp;hellip; wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure. Was there a supernatural element?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then when it dropped (in the first episode and all the promotional materials, so I don&amp;rsquo;t see it as a spoiler) that he&amp;rsquo;s going in to assisted living as a SPY! Well, I&amp;rsquo;m intriuged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun show, hilarious at times (especially with just how &lt;em>bad&lt;/em> Charles is at all this) and sad at others (it&amp;rsquo;s about old folks. Death, loneliness, and memory loss are just part of it). But it&amp;rsquo;s quite the ride all the way through.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do love the cast, Ted Danson as Charles is amazing. I enjoyed Mary Elizabeth Ellis
as his daughter Emily, even if her family troubles were a weird B plot. Lilah Richcreek Estrada as Julie did &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to solve this problem whatever it takes&amp;rsquo; wonderfully, and it was fascinating to see Stephanie Beatriz as head of staff Didi. I really need to watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine at some point&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then all of the old folks inhabiting those halls&amp;hellip; Man those were some performances. I honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t recognize any of them from other roles but I expect there are some well known names in there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful show and goes by quick. Well worth the watch!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doctor Who: Season 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/25/doctor-who-season-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/25/doctor-who-season-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m still re-watching Doctor Who in fits and starts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, after all that was great with Eccleston/Nine in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/02/doctor-who-season-1/">season 1&lt;/a>, how we get Tennant/Ten. Oh, I do enjoy his take on the doctor. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect mix of a whimsical seeing what he can get away with&amp;ndash;with the absolute feel of sadness and age that a being like the Doctor really should be feeling&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And all with Rose along for the ride. Rose gets a lot of hate at times, but I really think she was a pretty good first nu-Who companion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this season, we a fair few two parters, a bunch of great episodes. &lt;a href="#4-the-girl-in-the-fireplace">The Girl in the Fireplace&lt;/a> is a great take on &amp;rsquo;the Time Travelers wife&amp;rsquo; sort of thing. &lt;a href="#5-rise-of-the-cybermen">Rise of the Cybermen&lt;/a>/&lt;a href="#6-age-of-steel">Age of Steel&lt;/a> introduces us to some old foes. &lt;a href="#8-the-impossible-planet">The Impossible Planet&lt;/a>/&lt;a href="#9-satan-pit">Satan Pit&lt;/a> &lt;em>really&lt;/em> start getting into Doctor Who as sci-fi/horror (and I love it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="#10-love--monsters">Love &amp;amp; Monsters&lt;/a>. That&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; actually not that bad? It&amp;rsquo;s definitely one of the &amp;lsquo;Doctor-lite&amp;rsquo; episodes, which are always something interesting to try. The ending is crass and kind of terrifying to really think about&amp;ndash;rather than the laughs you might think they were going for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a solid season!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And &lt;a href="#special-the-runaway-bride">the special&lt;/a> introduces Donna! Even if she won&amp;rsquo;t be back for a bit, she&amp;rsquo;s certainly a contender for my favorite companion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Arcane: Season 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/21/arcane-season-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/21/arcane-season-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well then. I absolutely loved [[Arcane: Season 1]]. I still loved Season 2&amp;hellip; but I think they may have reached just a &lt;em>bit&lt;/em> too far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The art style is still amazing. We still have the same main steampunk/magitech/brightly colored visuals (Jink&amp;rsquo;s chaotic spraypunk style in particular), but there are also more scenes this time, with different styles matching the feel. Chaotic black slashes when a monster hunts, childhood crayon feeling drawings for memories, and SPACE for&amp;hellip; well, spoilers. And oh, the glitching. Weird, but quite the style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The characters&amp;hellip; I think at it&amp;rsquo;s heart, this show is about Vi and Jinx and man do they go through a lot in this season. I already felt for Jinx&amp;ndash;even if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure she could ever be redeemed in season 1&amp;ndash;and they just turn it up. On top of that, you have Jayce/Viktor, which&amp;hellip; man that one hurt this season. Plus Vi/Cait (go them!), and Mel/her mother (this one didn&amp;rsquo;t get nearly as much time as it needed), and Ekko (this could have been a whole season&amp;hellip; or left out entirely).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mostly, I think this was the biggest problem with this season. It&amp;rsquo;s only 9 episodes, mostly short of 45 minutes. That is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> enough time to fit everything that they tried to put in this show. I could have easily watched an entire season focussing on any one of those plots above&amp;hellip; and they tried to fit it all in. We get some resolutions&amp;hellip; but so much is left undone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently there won&amp;rsquo;t be an Arcane Season 3; instead, we&amp;rsquo;ll get one or more spinoff shows in the same universe but with other stories/settings/characters. This is absolutely for the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of feel, the first season did a good job of feeling real/grounded. It was a story of class warfare and the introduction of magic into a steampunk world. It all &amp;lsquo;fit&amp;rsquo;. Here, we get quite a bit more of the more &amp;lsquo;cosmic&amp;rsquo; side of what&amp;rsquo;s apparently also kicking around in this world. I liked it, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, but it felt so much bigger and weirder than the first season that they didn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit together&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall? I still quite enjoyed Season 2. It is absolutely worth watching Season 1 and once you have&amp;hellip; well, you have to go on, right? I&amp;rsquo;ll totally check out any spin-offs that we get.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Taskmaster: Series 18</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/20/taskmaster-series-18/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/01/20/taskmaster-series-18/</guid><description>&lt;p>I &amp;hellip; managed to miss [[todo:Taskmaster: Series 17]] somehow. Anyways!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another delightful season. This was a fun cast. Baba was full of chaos, Rosie got away with so much crap (sometimes literally) and her team tasks with Jack were such chaos. Andy has serious mad professor vibes (mostly the hair I suppose). Emma&amp;hellip; Emma was my favorite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rosie having cerebral palsy certainly started out with a different flavor to the season. But man she has a sense of humor about the whole thing. I think it took Greg and the other contestants a minute to feel out how far to go (&amp;ldquo;Is it too early in the series to mention I DON&amp;rsquo;T have cerebral palsy?&amp;rdquo; - Emma)&amp;hellip; but once they did, that was a lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>As you can tell by the way I talk, I suffer from being Northern. &amp;ndash; Rosie&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Overall, what do you want? I love this show. Another great season. Time to go back to 17!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
