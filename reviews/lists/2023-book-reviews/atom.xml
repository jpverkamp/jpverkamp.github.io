&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>e: what are you reading?&lt;br>
J: Hawkeye&lt;br>
…&lt;br>
z: what are you reading?&lt;br>
e: hawk pie&lt;br>
z: why are you reading pot pie&lt;br>
e: hawk pie&lt;br>
z: no that isn’t right&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And now, a quick interluded with the &lt;em>other&lt;/em> Hawkeye.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/hawkeye-2012-v3-391282.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Broke in LA. Good times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course she finds her own trouble. And gets herself out of it. More or less. I like comics Kate Bishop. The real strengths are the Hawkeyes together though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hawkeye, Volume 4: Rio Bravo</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/01/hawkeye-volume-4-rio-bravo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/01/hawkeye-volume-4-rio-bravo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Down on his luck, eh? Oh the fallout from buying the building. Standing up to the goons. Poor &lt;span class="spoiler">Gil&lt;/span>
. :/&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In comics everything ends up connected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we get deaf Hawkeye storyline. Not quite the same as the show, but its neat seeing inspirations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s quite the story and good to see some closure of sorts. For now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Build Your Own Redis with C/C++</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/31/build-your-own-redis-with-c/c-/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/31/build-your-own-redis-with-c/c-/</guid><description>&lt;p>Stumbled on &lt;a href="https://build-your-own.org/">Build Your Own Redis with C/C++&lt;/a>. Decided to read it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To some extent&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the point is. It does definitely go into a lot of the networking and data structure details you&amp;rsquo;d need to build your own Redis. So it certainly lives up to the name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, I feel like a lot of the book is spent down in the weeds, implementing some of the less important details of how Redis works. At that level, it&amp;rsquo;s a generic networking/data structures book with Redis as the example. Which works, just not something that I need at this point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hawkeye, Volume 2: Little Hits</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/31/hawkeye-volume-2-little-hits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/31/hawkeye-volume-2-little-hits/</guid><description>&lt;p>Clint is in over his head. Again. Tracksuit mafia. Managing a building. Installing AV equipment. Valentine’s Day. Women.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The dog gets it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Poor &lt;span class="spoiler">Gil&lt;/span>
. :/&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a neat story, if somewhat incomplete.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hawkeye, Volume 1: My Life as a Weapon</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/30/hawkeye-volume-1-my-life-as-a-weapon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/30/hawkeye-volume-1-my-life-as-a-weapon/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Avengers don’t really make any sense… Hawkeye least of all. It’s the Disney+ series in a nutshell. Let’s see how the comics did it first…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay, so I can see how the bones are the same, but it’s a different story. Hawkeye (s)? Check. Clint and Kate. They’re cute together; platonically. Dog? Check. Tracksuit mafia? Bro. Fisk? CHECK. Bad guy auction? Check.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it’s really good. I’m looking forward to where this goes next!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sunreach</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/29/sunreach/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/29/sunreach/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s cute. Part teenage romance, part &amp;lsquo;how in the world do we take care of these random alien slugs anyways&amp;rsquo;. Well worth a piece of the Skyward universe.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>All-New X-Men, Vol. 7: The Utopians</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/28/all-new-x-men-vol.-7-the-utopians/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/28/all-new-x-men-vol.-7-the-utopians/</guid><description>&lt;p>So we have a trainingish montage with Jean and Magik, two issues were saw already, and a big character moment for Bobby…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/all-new-x-men-7-9c940b.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>… which is cute way to do it I suppose. If it had any other impact.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guardians of the Galaxy &amp; X-Men: The Black Vortex</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/27/guardians-of-the-galaxy-x-men-the-black-vortex/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/27/guardians-of-the-galaxy-x-men-the-black-vortex/</guid><description>&lt;p>X-Men! Guardians! What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/all-new-x-men-6-5-8b3cd0.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What already went wrong…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell: the Black Vortex. A magical MacGuffin that can apparently make anyone… more. It’s up to our heroes (more or less) to…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/all-new-x-men-6-5-7c96ad.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Destroy it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Use it?!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And off we go on a wild ride that’s only sort of an X-Men story in that they’re at least in it (in various stages of powered up). But it’s still a neat one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward and back to the main line once again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Starsight</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/26/starsight/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/26/starsight/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“A hero does not choose her trials. She steps into the darkness, then she faces what comes next.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you are the sort to want absolutely zero spoilers going into a book &lt;em>stop reading now&lt;/em>. Go read the book (it&amp;rsquo;s really good, that&amp;rsquo;s not a spoiler :spoiler:) and then come back. You have been warned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay, now that that&amp;rsquo;s out of the way. It&amp;rsquo;s been &amp;hellip; three years since I first read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/02/28/skyward/">Skyward&lt;/a>. WheN I read it, the sequels weren&amp;rsquo;t even out yet&amp;hellip; when Starsight first came out, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to it. I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat lamenting that lack now. 😄 But as they say, the second best time to plant a tree is today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, Starsight takes place where Skyward left off. Spensa has some crazy new powers she doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand, M-Bot is out in the open&amp;ndash;and really the star of the book&amp;ndash;, and humanity is ready to take back the stars&amp;hellip; More or less.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Spoilers. For real, albeit minor.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>All-New X-Men, Vol. 6: The Ultimate Adventure</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/25/all-new-x-men-vol.-6-the-ultimate-adventure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/25/all-new-x-men-vol.-6-the-ultimate-adventure/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/all-new-x-men-6-34226a.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As if time travel weren’t enough… now the new old X-Men happen to bump into a new new mutant with the power to send them to all sorts of different places and times. Oh boy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Miles Morales. Dinosaurs in Antarctica. Another Kid Wolverine. Jeans Grey. MOLE MAN. Dr. Doom. This volume really has it all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just wish they didn’t have a whole new set of problems when they can’t even deal with the whole out of time thing. That is going to get resolved… right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>All-New X-Men, Vol. 5: One Down</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/24/all-new-x-men-vol.-5-one-down/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/24/all-new-x-men-vol.-5-one-down/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/all-new-x-men-5-7ff825.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yup. Ya done screwed up Beast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beast mopes. Jean mopes. The future future Brotherhood come back to the past/future. Shape shifters shift shapes. Everything is timey whimey and complicated. No one really learns anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A time travel loop—keep trying until it works—is kind of overdone… But if you’re ever going to use it, this is the storyline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh comics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Rose Code</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/23/the-rose-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/23/the-rose-code/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s wonderful. In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s the story of three women who find themselves working at Bletchley Park during the height of the code breaking parts of World War II. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve read quite a lot about from a more technical level and I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with Alan Turing&amp;rsquo;s (the Prof&amp;rsquo;s) time there, but this is an entirely different story&amp;ndash;and one well, well worth the read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>All-New X-Men, Vol. 4: All-Different</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/20/all-new-x-men-vol.-4-all-different/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/20/all-new-x-men-vol.-4-all-different/</guid><description>&lt;p>Looks like things are settling and everyone is more or less getting along… as impossible as that seems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/all-new-x-men-4-a9b25d.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All New X-Man! He said the thing! Also:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Magic.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Comics are delightful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, I guess they need a new big bad. Enter… religion!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/all-new-x-men-4-fce3b3.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run by Stryker apparently? Oh my.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was a bit worried about a let down after Battle of the Atom. Seems I needn’t have been. At least through the main story line. A bunch of random seeming issues as it went on though. That was strange.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>X-Men: Battle of the Atom</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/16/x-men-battle-of-the-atom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/16/x-men-battle-of-the-atom/</guid><description>&lt;p>Taking a quick side trip to another line of comics as things mix a bit. It’s kind of bonkers how in the world you’re supposed to keep track of everything with all of these crossovers. Which I suppose is the idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/all-new-x-men-3-5-016b60.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Timey whimey madness ensues, we get a Back to the Future moment, the X-Men go home… who are we kidding. Of course things go weirder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth tracking down. Worth reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man that was a ride.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>All-New X-Men, Vol. 3: Out of Their Depth</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/13/all-new-x-men-vol.-3-out-of-their-depth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 23:00:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/13/all-new-x-men-vol.-3-out-of-their-depth/</guid><description>&lt;p>Man it’s complicated keeping track of things with shape shifters and mind readers and time travelers and all these different teams running around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Isn’t it great?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>All-New X-Men, Vol. 2: Here to Stay</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/13/all-new-x-men-vol.-2-here-to-stay/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 23:00:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/13/all-new-x-men-vol.-2-here-to-stay/</guid><description>&lt;p>Man super hero comics are bonkers. So much history. So many crossovers. And it’s all the more intense when you add time travel to the mix…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Love it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Engineering in Plain Sight: An Illustrated Field Guide to the Constructed Environment</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/12/engineering-in-plain-sight-an-illustrated-field-guide-to-the-constructed-environment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/12/engineering-in-plain-sight-an-illustrated-field-guide-to-the-constructed-environment/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a delightful read. I relatively recently came across the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PracticalEngineeringChannel">Practical Engineer&lt;/a> YouTube Channel, where he goes into a whole pile of various civil engineering and other infrastructure topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A particular favorite of mine is:&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_OpC4fH3mEk" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>So when I saw that he had a book&amp;hellip; of course I was going to read it! And it&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome. Topic by topic, he goes into a high level but with some detail on all sorts of ways that infrastructure actually works and neat things you can look out for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I certainly learned a lot and I highly recommend checking it out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;d like to see my various thoughts throughout the book, read on!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Perilous Journey</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/10/the-mysterious-benedict-society-and-the-perilous-journey/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/10/the-mysterious-benedict-society-and-the-perilous-journey/</guid><description>&lt;p>Man those are long books. 😄 Enjoyable though.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>May your adventures bring you closer together, even as they take you far away from home.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Kate is delightful, I like seeing her growing relationship with Milligan. Constance seems to becoming slightly psychic, albeit in a way that they brush off as being very aware of the world and good at pattern matching. Sticky is more self aware while still being a wonderful brain about it all. And Reynie is growing into a solid natural leader. He already had it coming, but it&amp;rsquo;s still good to see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s less contained than the first book. Rather than mostly taking place in one place, it&amp;rsquo;s more of a kidnap/mysterious plot that ends up traveling a chunk of the world. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice change of pace, even if it feels a little contrived to get the kids on their own again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>All-New X-Men, Vol. 1: Yesterday's X-Men</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/09/all-new-x-men-vol.-1-yesterdays-x-men/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/09/all-new-x-men-vol.-1-yesterdays-x-men/</guid><description>&lt;p>Been a while since I’ve read any of the more direct ‘comic booky’ comics. So let’s do this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/all-new-x-men-1-d8bba3.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All righty then.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Defending Elysium</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/07/defending-elysium/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/07/defending-elysium/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“You must understand that he knew the risks of living in an undeveloped civilization. Creatures of lesser intelligence cannot be held responsible for their acts of barbarity. You have not yet learned a better way.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve only read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/02/28/skyward/">Skyward&lt;/a> before of that series, so on re-reading, I noticed that Defending Elysium is sort of a prequel? It&amp;rsquo;s unclear to me exactly how much. It feels like the same world, but set well before and with none of the same characters? Especially since I haven&amp;rsquo;t read past Skyward before&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a bit more worldbuilding and background than I&amp;rsquo;d otherwise be aware of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Short, but worth a read in my opinion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Wicked + The Divine, Vol. 9: Okay</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/03/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-9-okay/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 00:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/03/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-9-okay/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it ends. And a touch of Volume 8 actually came back to pull everything together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think I preferred the journey to the destination. It’s interesting to have closure, but still, I want to know what could possibly be next in this world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>C’est la vide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Wicked + The Divine, Vol. 8: Old Is the New New</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/03/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-8-old-is-the-new-new/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 00:00:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/03/the-wicked--the-divine-vol.-8-old-is-the-new-new/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a penultimate volume … that was strange. It’s not part of the main story, but rather a number of loosely connected shorts. There are a lot of interesting stories to be told there… but not in such short snippets with so little time left.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward to the conclusion!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Bone Ship's Wake</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/02/the-bone-ships-wake/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/02/the-bone-ships-wake/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And what is life for us if we are not lurching from one life-or-death situation to another?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Maes is MIA and Joron picks up the slack in quite the way&amp;ndash;as the well named Black Pirate. It&amp;rsquo;s such a huge growth to see from him, from the very beginning when he and Maes first met and probably the best part of the books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also great to see how the increasing worldbuilding around the Guillame and the Keyshan come to bear. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more there than the reader or the characters really had to deal with at first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, I do feel somewhat let down by the latter half of the book. There&amp;rsquo;s an awful lot of interesting in the beginning; however, as everything builds and builds, despite plenty of action&amp;ndash;the story just sort of ends. I feel like there could have been more, but so it goes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Locklands</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/01/locklands/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/01/locklands/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We’re all the result of countless actions and choices made throughout the centuries, and the odds of those actions and choices going the exact same way again are basically nil.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s certainly a finale! After &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/06/foundryside/">Foundryside&lt;/a> started out as a nice bit of worldbuilding wrapped around a heist and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/28/shorefall/">Shorefall&lt;/a> turned things up to 11 with the return of the old, almost alien magic&amp;hellip; Now we have Locklands with hive minds, epic immortal duals, and finally&amp;hellip; a few answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man that&amp;rsquo;s a crazy (awesome) book.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
