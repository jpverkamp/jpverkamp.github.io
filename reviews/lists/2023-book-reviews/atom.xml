Watched it. Quite enjoyed it. Figured I should read the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s not bad, but I enjoyed the show more. For one, it pulls in Kaz and co, which don&amp;rsquo;t appear in this novel at all (they&amp;rsquo;re originally from the related Six of Crows books), which is a bummer. For two, the additional dynamic of Alina as half-Shu in addition to being an orphan added rather a lot to her character.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Book of Zog</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/10/the-book-of-zog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/10/the-book-of-zog/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The man scowled, but Zogrusz sensed a slight softening in his mood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I understand, stranger. I remember my first time in this room, when I felt His presence looming over me. But you cannot so blithely stroke the visage of our dread lord! Such disrespect might summon His wrath, and all of Xochintl would suffer.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“What delightful nonsense!” Zogrusz exclaimed, clapping his hands together. “Did you make it up yourself?”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Zogrusz is an Eldrich Horror, a being from beyond time and space. But&amp;hellip; a nice one? That just wants to do the right thing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book follows Zog and the quasi-Earth (it&amp;rsquo;s never entirely clear) he settles on through thousands of years (mostly with large time jumps) and the rise and fall of various religions up to (and through) and approaching cosmic horror style end of the world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 9: The Hunter and the Hunted</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/07/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-9-the-hunter-and-the-hunted/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/07/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-9-the-hunter-and-the-hunted/</guid><description>&lt;p>The hand returns…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-9-textbundle-31ffad.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, not that Hand. Logan’s hand. The one with the adamantium claws. I’ve actually enjoyed seeing him with the mismatched claws for a few volumes now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bit of a bummer, other than that. More spinning wheels with nowhere to go for Old Man Logan.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rosewater</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/06/rosewater/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/06/rosewater/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The idea of a singular hero and a manifest destiny just makes us lazy. There is no destiny. There is choice, there is action, and any other narrative perpetuates a myth that someone else out there will fix our problems with a magic sword and a blessing from the gods.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Rosewater has a fascinating premise. Take the world a half century in the future. Most things are the same, but there&amp;rsquo;s a bit more tech floating around, mostly. Introduce a massive alien organism that lands in London and ends up burrowing it&amp;rsquo;s way to Nigeria. From that alien blob, fill the atmosphere with alien microorganisms/cells that create their own xenosphere, enabling (among other things) psychic powers in some very small proportion of the population.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 8: To Kill For</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/05/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-8-to-kill-for/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/05/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-8-to-kill-for/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-8-textbundle-093e2f.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First half: Kingpin has gone all respectable! On the surface. Again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s impressive that keeps working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bullseye is a weird character. Logan’s eye is not healing. And that’s about it&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second half: An Old Geezer and some Z-list X-Men defend the school from… dating site scams?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cute. But also nothing special.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/04/a-wizards-guide-to-defensive-baking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/04/a-wizards-guide-to-defensive-baking/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“It is nearly impossibly to be sad when eating a blueberry muffin. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that&amp;rsquo;s a scientific fact.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I need to read more &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/t.-kingfisher/">T. Kingfisher&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/01/nettle-bone/">Nettle &amp; Bone&lt;/a> was delightful and, if anything, A Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Defensive Baking is even better!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, we have a world with a specialized sorts of wizards. You might be able to cast lightning bolts&amp;hellip; or you might have the power to animate and converse with dead horses. Or you &lt;em>might&lt;/em> even have magical powers over&amp;hellip; bread!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s such a delightful idea and Kingfisher manages to do all sorts of fun things with it. Some obvious (Mongo eat your gingerbread heart out), some less so (Bob the sourdough starter; so delightful).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 7: Scarlet Samurai</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/31/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-7-scarlet-samurai/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/31/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-7-scarlet-samurai/</guid><description>&lt;p>The hand! Samurai! Resurrection!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-7-textbundle-9db182.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s a hot mess of a story—although some of that is probably not really having the background for who a lot of these people are. So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was nice actually (sort of) seeing Logan deal with the slower healing factor. I feel like though most of this we’ve heard of it, but no real problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fun enough read. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stories of Your Life and Others</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/30/stories-of-your-life-and-others/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/30/stories-of-your-life-and-others/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that was a delightful collection of shorts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t often read anthologies, but perhaps I should read more. I do love me some epic fantasy (I&amp;rsquo;ve read the entire &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-wheel-of-time/">The Wheel of Time&lt;/a> half a dozen times now&amp;hellip;), but there&amp;rsquo;s just something about a story that builds up quickly, gets to the point, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t stick around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think of the 8, I only bounced off 1 (which was actually a fine story, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t suspend disbelief enough for the premise) and 1 was a bit meh, just for how short it was. 6 of 8 I absolutely loved though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Absolutely worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VenCo</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/29/venco/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/29/venco/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Hold on a minute,” Lucky said. So far, the stories weren’t making things any clearer. “I don’t get it. Did someone give us the spoons?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Well, yes, in a manner of speaking,” Meena said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“But I found mine. You both found yours.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“In a secret tunnel off your basement?” Lettie replied. “Really? Hanging from a spider web in a graveyard on a specific day?
At the bottom of a box of donated books? Statistically improbable.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Never mind probability, what about the laws of nature? The world cannot be just a series of randoms,” Freya chimed in. “Might as well believe in some beardo in the sky.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a book about spoons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And witches, of course.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Well, I know there are Wiccans, right? Like a religion?” No one gave her any indication she was on the right path, so she kept talking. “And there are Halloween witches—like vampires and demons and all that. And I know about the bullshit witch trials. Thousands of women burned at the stake for being smart or queer or loud. I guess that’s about it.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But really about spoons.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blood Cross</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/27/blood-cross/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/27/blood-cross/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/18/skinwalker/">Skinwalker&lt;/a> we were introduced to Jane/Beast/and the various things that go bump in the New Orleans night.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve got that out of the way, it&amp;rsquo;s time to turn things up. Dig into the history of Vampires in this world&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I was among the first hundred who followed the Sons of Darkness, turned by one who was among the first ten of the Cursed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>Six-Gun Snow White</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/26/six-gun-snow-white/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/26/six-gun-snow-white/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>From that day forward she never used my name. Eventually I forgot it. Mrs. H called me something new. She named me cruel and smirking, she named me not for beauty or for cleverness or for sweetness. She named me a thing I could aspire to but never become, the one thing I was not and could never be: Snow White.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that was most certainly a book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take (the vague outline) the story of Snow White. Make it a Western. Things get weird.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Magician's Land</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/25/the-magicians-land/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/25/the-magicians-land/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It didn’t matter where you were, if you were in a room full of books you were at least halfway home.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/16/the-magicians/">The Magicians&lt;/a>, we had half Harry Potter &lt;em>but cynical&lt;/em> and half Narnia&amp;hellip; &lt;em>but cynical&lt;/em>. In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/20/the-magician-king/">The Magician King&lt;/a>, we mostly stuck around in Fillory (the Narnia analogue). But right at the end&amp;hellip; our well loved (:sarcasm:) main character Quentin pays the ultimate price: he doesn&amp;rsquo;t get to hang out in the magical land anymore and has to go home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Magician&amp;rsquo;s Land picks up from there, with one plot following Quentin as he settles back into a normal life, becomes a teacher, promptly gets fired, and descends to a life of crime. As one does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, we have the (new and improved?) Kings and Queens of Fillory dealingw ith their own sort of armageddon. Turns out saving magic&amp;hellip; wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 6: Days of Anger</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/23/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-6-days-of-anger/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/23/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-6-days-of-anger/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hulks! Maestro!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-6-textbundle-6dc07a.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently in all the wacky parallel universe shenanigans, Maestro “rescued” a bunch of Hulks and brought them back to this world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowing basically nothing about how Maestro came to be or what all these Hulks can actually do, it’s a strange story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Magician King</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/20/the-magician-king/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/20/the-magician-king/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>That was the thing about the world: it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that things were harder than you thought they were going to be, it was that they were hard in ways that you didn&amp;rsquo;t expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Turns out, if you take &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/16/the-magicians/">The Magicians&lt;/a>, tone down Quentin a bit, and cut the magic school parts to focus mostly on Fillory and adventuring, you get a much better book. It&amp;rsquo;s still a bit much at times and definitely has some &amp;lsquo;middle book syndrome&amp;rsquo; going on, but I quite enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you didn&amp;rsquo;t like the Magicians, you might like this book. If you liked it, particularly the second half, this is probably right up your alley.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 5: Past Lives</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/19/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-5-past-lives/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/19/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-5-past-lives/</guid><description>&lt;p>Memories of the past/future…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-5-textbundle-9491f6.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And he wants to go back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This can’t possibly go well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially when none of his “friends” will help, so he has to turn to darker sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we end up with is Logan bouncing (again) through time, reliving his old adventures for a few pages at a time, unable to change anything that matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s an interesting idea, but once again it doesn’t really have time to breath. All too soon, we’re back to the status quo.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Skinwalker</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/18/skinwalker/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/18/skinwalker/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that was fun. I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for a good new (to me) Urban Fantasy&amp;ndash;and Jane Yellowrock (so far) hits all the right notes. The worldbuilding is neat. The plot is basic enough, but solid. I like the main character(s). And I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing where it goes from here!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the biggest/really only negative with the book is that the writing style starts out fairly rough. It evens out fairly quickly though, so I expect it&amp;rsquo;s more of both the author and the reader finding the voice of the book than anything else.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Magicians</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/16/the-magicians/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/16/the-magicians/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I got my heart&amp;rsquo;s desire, and there my troubles began.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well. The majority of comments certainly nailed this one. Two interesting premises in a trenchcoat wrapped in the guise of cynicism and dark humor, underscored by the most depressed to the point of hard to read main character I think I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interesting enough I&amp;rsquo;ll give the sequel a try (I really liked the ending twists(ish)). I wish it were better.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 4: Old Monsters</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/12/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-4-old-monsters/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/12/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-4-old-monsters/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dracula is calling to the Vampires.

&lt;p>Which, for some reason includes Jubilee. Which Logan, having killed here once seems to take personal.&lt;/p>

Only to square off another piece of goes future past.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s fascinating seeing Logan’s past, everything between when the villains took over and when he got sent to the Battleworlds, intermixed with the current present.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fascinating… and bloody. But that’s Wolverine for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-3-textbundle-aae697.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Fearing what could come, he goes to the one place be feels he can do the most good: to guard his future wife?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-2-textbundle-fba77f.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yeah… I’m not sure what else he thought might happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily, a few big fights, a pile of blood and bodies, and a visit with a young old friend later and he seems to get the idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Goblin Emperor</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/08/the-goblin-emperor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/08/the-goblin-emperor/</guid><description>&lt;p>The youngest, half-Goblin son of the forth wife of the Emperor Varenechibel IV&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>; long ago exiled to a far corner of the empire. Until a freak airship accident&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> kills the Emperor and all of his early heirs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suddenly, Maia is thrust into a whole new life. A life of money and power; but also a life without privacy, a life that he has &lt;em>absolutely&lt;/em> no idea how to deal with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For better or for worse, The Goblin Emperor has surprisingly low stakes. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a book about the new emperor standing against invasion. It&amp;rsquo;s not about some world ending threat. It&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em>really&lt;/em> even about traitors trying to take the throne&amp;ndash;although that one at least we get a bit of&lt;sup id="fnref1:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I actually really like it. It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;lsquo;slice of life&amp;rsquo; (a genre I&amp;rsquo;ve recently really started to love), where the life is that of a new Emperor. Who happens to be a (half-)Goblin.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 1: Berzerker</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/05/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-1-berzerker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/05/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-1-berzerker/</guid><description>&lt;p>And now, after &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/03/wolverine-old-man-logan/">Wolverine: Old Man Logan&lt;/a> in the apocalyptic future and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/04/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-0-warzones/">Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 0: Warzones!&lt;/a> in Battleworld, we&amp;rsquo;re finally back in the present&amp;ndash;and, I assume, in the main universe?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Old Man Logan of course goes straight from shock to murder. If he&amp;rsquo;s in the past (from his own point of view), well then of course he&amp;rsquo;s going to have to &lt;em>fix the future&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-1-210d15.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if this isn&amp;rsquo;t actually &lt;em>his&lt;/em> past? What if it isn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>his&lt;/em> future that he&amp;rsquo;s setting out to change?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat idea, but a bit thin on execution. I would have rather him kick up a bit more trouble before starting to figure things out. Seeing an equally old Captain America (no idea what the story was there) was neat. But the real amusing part is the apart team up with Kate Bishop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-1-a65f7c.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not at all who I would have picked&amp;hellip; but amusing!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to think. I really liked the &lt;em>world&lt;/em> of Old Man Logan. Now we have Logan without that world. Bit of a bait and switch, but I suppose it has potential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 0: Warzones!</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/04/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-0-warzones/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/04/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-0-warzones/</guid><description>A followup to Wolverine: Old Man Logan and a quick stop in the Battleworlds that predate Secret Wars.
It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating bit of story, with poor &amp;lsquo;Old Man&amp;rsquo; Logan bouncing between a world (or two) where the X-Men live, a world where anyone not in Iron man armor contracts a techno virus, and a world of the dead.
On the other hand, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really go anywhere&amp;ndash;not until we get to Secret Wars itself.</description></item><item><title>Spells for Forgetting</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/03/spells-for-forgetting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/03/spells-for-forgetting/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mom had gotten better through the years at blending in and appearing at first glance like other mothers. But she still spent the equinox in the woods and the solstice at the sea. She still whispered old words over her teacups and I’d caught her muttering a curse as we passed the front door of our neighbor’s house more than once.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating sort of book; dark and magical and a bit surreal. The more twisted aspects of &amp;lsquo;small town&amp;rsquo; life, a murder mystery, and romance all in one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/03/mr.-penumbras-24-hour-bookstore/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2023 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/03/mr.-penumbras-24-hour-bookstore/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh, to have such potential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take the idea of a used bookstore in San Francisco. Give it an awesome name. Skinny, but three stories tall (and I imagine, open all the way up rather than having 3 actual floors). Add a mysterious &amp;lsquo;back&amp;rsquo; section, where strange people come to &amp;lsquo;borrow&amp;rsquo; strange books. Some sort of secret society? A merging of new* technologies&amp;ndash;e-readers! search engines! OCR! book scanning!&amp;ndash;and archaic&amp;ndash;books! printing presses! actually; that&amp;rsquo;s about it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s got the seeds of what should have been a great story!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really do love the early setting of the book. It&amp;rsquo;s got a perfect magical feel to it. I really want to visit Mr. Penumbra&amp;rsquo;s!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But unfortunately, from there (and in my opinion), it goes somewhat off the rails. Everything feels too each. The characters are all a bit &amp;rsquo;too much&amp;rsquo;. The technology (a big part of the book) all feels slightly off. The big reveal is &amp;hellip; meh?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting premise stretched thin. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/03/wolverine-old-man-logan/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2023 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/03/wolverine-old-man-logan/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s quite a story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that I really like the Marvel stories that take place a bit further from our own world&amp;ndash;gives them a chance to really change things up. And multiple universes lets you have characters you know and love&amp;ndash;and brutally murder them. Always a good time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“I knew about faeries. They didn’t,” she protested. She hated the faery inability to lie more and more as he spoke. It would be easier to lie and deny how painlessly she had become fey. It would be easier to say that she wasn’t adjusting to her new life far faster than she’d ever thought. It would be easier to say she was struggling. Because then he wouldn’t be doing this to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>After &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/ink-exchange/">Ink Exchange&lt;/a>, I was worried.

&lt;p>For every nine years, the fold from Beyond the Wall and over the hill set up their stalls, and for a day and a night the meadow played host to the Faerie market; and there was, for one day and one night in nine years, commerce between the nations.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I do love Neil Gaiman&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. He does weird/creepy/dark perfectly well. Stardust is a great example of &lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a dark fairy tale, a la the Brothers Grimm. A city on the border between Victorian England and Fairie. The contrast of worlds. An adventure full of princes and witches, woodland animals, magic, and of course: fairy tale love.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“So, having found a lady, could you not have come to her aid, or left her alone? Why drag her into your foolishness?&amp;quot;&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;Love,&amp;rdquo; he explained.&lt;br>
She looked at him with eyes the blue of the sky. &amp;ldquo;I hope you choke on it,&amp;rdquo; she said, flatly.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a great listen. A bit weird, since apparently it was also originally published in graphic novel format and is also supposed to be a great movie. Looks like I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to go through it a few more times.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Anubis Gates</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/27/the-anubis-gates/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/27/the-anubis-gates/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Time,” he said solemnly, “is comparable to a river flowing under a layer of ice. It stretches us out like water weeds, from root to tip, from birth to death, curled around whatever rocks or snags happen to lie in our path; and no one can get out of the river because of the ice roof, and no one can turn back against the current for an instant.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have a magical mishap that blows holes in time, secret societies at each other&amp;rsquo;s throats, beggers&amp;rsquo; guilds, poets, time traveling tourism, and body swapping shenanigans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s certainly a longer read, yet even with the runtime I found myself wanting more in certain areas.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Frugal Wizard’s Handbook for Surviving Medieval England</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/27/the-frugal-wizards-handbook-for-surviving-medieval-england/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/27/the-frugal-wizards-handbook-for-surviving-medieval-england/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What products did one use in Anglo-Saxon England? Beaver snot? A grudging four stars.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, I feel like “a grudging four stars” is about where this book ends up for me.

Without having read basically any of the leading material in the main Earth-616 lineup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/secret-wars-textbundle-07da17.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird and confusing what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eventually, you more or less get the idea, but until then, it&amp;rsquo;s really like being dropped into yet another crazy chaotic patchwork world, with Doom as God.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s actually a pretty cool world&amp;ndash;truth be told&amp;ndash;with lots of variations on characters we&amp;rsquo;ve seen otherwise. I enjoy the idea of a whole army of Thors as the local police force. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But eventually, we get a few stowaways from Earth-616 and &amp;hellip; well, one* from Earth-1610 (the Ultimate Universe) I&amp;rsquo;ve been following (*: two technically, we also get Maker&amp;ndash;yay&amp;hellip;). And that&amp;rsquo;s really it. Eventually they have to save the day and rewrite time. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a way to kill off Earth-1610 and a bunch of other universes in order to simplify the overall multiverse?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kind of sucks that untold billions have to die / never have existed for that to happen&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall: Interesting enough story, especially a few issues in where what&amp;rsquo;s actually going on becomes more clear. Ending is kind of lame. The reason Miles gets to stick around (despite his being the best storyline in a while from the Ultimate Universe) is &amp;hellip; hilarious and weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to read something a bit less &amp;hellip; all encompassing for a while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate End</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/25/ultimate-end/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/25/ultimate-end/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so the Ultimate Universe ends&amp;hellip; with a weird confusing mess of a send off?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s sort of a companion to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/25/secret-wars/">Secret Wars&lt;/a>, more specifically focusing on what is happening in the Earth-1610/Ultimate Universe part of the Battleworld&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s not really necessary.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Same team, same smaller stakes. Not going to lose states (again), but plenty of lives are on the line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s interesting seeing the team dynamics (on again, off again, half a dozen times in a single volume…).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The art for this one got weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ultimates name still doesn’t really work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it’s weird that the Kate Bishop story line almost 100% got dropped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Making people change because you can’t deal with who they are isn’t how it’s supposed to be done. What needs to be done is for people to pull their heads out of their asses. You say ‘cure.’ I hear ‘you’re not human enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Been a bit since I last read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/08/23/old-mans-war/">any Scalzi&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;m glad to get back around to it though. Lock In is very good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, Lock In takes place in a near future Earth where a flu-like pandemic (Haden&amp;rsquo;s Syndrome) has caused &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/locked-in%20syndrome">locked-in syndrome&lt;/a> in some small percent of the world&amp;rsquo;s population (a small percent of billions is still an awful lot of people). Those affected are completely paralyzed, unable to move, while still being fully aware and conscious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily(ish) a massive global effort has figured out how to embed computer hardware in their brains so as to allow them to remotely pilot either robotic bodies (threeps&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>) or (more rarely) other humans who&amp;rsquo;ve allowed them access&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This of course is widely accepted by the rest of humanity and causes no issues whatsoever.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Getting ink felt right, like it would help her put her life in order, to move forwards. It was her body, despite the things that&amp;rsquo;d been done to it, and she wanted to claim it, to own it, to prove that to herself. She knew it wasn&amp;rsquo;t magic, but the idea of writing her own identity felt like the closest she could get to reclaiming her life. Sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s power in the act; sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s strength in words. She wanted to find an image that represented those things she was feeling, to etch it on her skin as tangible proof of her decision to change.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s not what I expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s definitely a sequel to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/wicked-lovely/">Wicked Lovely&lt;/a>. In that it&amp;rsquo;s in the same world with many of the same characters and takes place after the events of the first book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; fine? It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, if a bit jarring, to see more of the world and a broader cast of characters. But the plot is ugly, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to root for anyone really, and I missed the continuity you get from sticking with a united point of view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: trigger warning for rape. Off screen, but it&amp;rsquo;s a major plot point of the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll probably try one more in the series, since it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to go back to Ash. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>All-New Ultimates, Volume 1: Power for Power</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/22/all-new-ultimates-volume-1-power-for-power/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/22/all-new-ultimates-volume-1-power-for-power/</guid><description>So, a new team. It’s… certainly not the Ultimates, despite the name. More of a Spidey and Friends.
But you know? It works.
It’s a lot more local level, where Spider-Man really shines. It’s fun seeing Bombshell grown up a bit. Cloak and Dagger are great. Yay Jessica Drew.
And yay ish Kitty Pride? She’s been there since just about the beginning. Pretty crazy to think.

&lt;p>Haven’t you ever been in a fairy tale before?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s one of those books that just &lt;em>feels&lt;/em> like a fairy tale. An ageless story. A story passed down from long ago ages of myth and fantasy.

&lt;p>Nah, Future Foundation!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a really weird story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Random incursions from random dimensions. Animal people. Cyclops super heroes. Atlanteans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And oy talk about tonal whiplash. Death and doom to animal people to kidnapping to quippy one liners to rape. All over the place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally, the art. It starts off, a bit unfinished… but I kind of like it. But then it gets even more unfinished and cartoony. Not a fan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a vaguely interesting story wrapped up in a lot of weird.&lt;/p>

Figured it was probably about time. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, take the modern world and turn a number of interesting trends up to 11. Dissolve family ties. Genetically engineer children as a sort of uber-caste system. Make sex purely recreational. Add to that the perspective of &amp;rsquo;the Savage&amp;rsquo;. One raised on a reservation without this &amp;lsquo;modern&amp;rsquo; world&amp;ndash;giving an outsider&amp;rsquo;s perspective to all the changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the craziest thing is that this book was written in 1932&amp;hellip; Oddly prescient that. It could extrapolate from today&amp;rsquo;s world about as easily as the world of almost a century ago. Probably a bit more influence from the Internet and social media; perhaps more commentary on how the sexual revolution in Brave New World compares to what actually happened in the decades after the book&amp;rsquo;s release. But I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what else I&amp;rsquo;d see changed. A mark of good distopian sci-fi, that. For better or for worse.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/cataclysm-the-ultimates-last-stand/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/cataclysm-the-ultimates-last-stand/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another giant story; the second &amp;lsquo;biggest&amp;rsquo; of the Ultimate Marvel Universe&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Uh oh. Gah Lak Tus? Time to meet GALACTUS!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m sure this will go well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being titled Cataclysm—and the last in the Ultimate Marvel Universe line—after all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The X-Men’s involvement? Meh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spider-Man? Pretty awesome. Touching and personal, even in the face of a giant purple guy with a fancy hat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ultimates: what is with that art style? Everyone getting infected with Galactus is amusing. Purple Hulk!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ultimates Last Stand? The meat of the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reed Richard&amp;rsquo;s redemption arc (of a sort)? What&amp;hellip; he does not deserve that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s kind of a deus ex solution to an impossible problem. But that’s sort of the way with comics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/cataclysm-textbundle-97dfbe.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

That was not necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel like most of these &amp;lsquo;big events&amp;rsquo; have ended up being overwhelming. They just need more room to breathe than comics can give them. The &amp;lsquo;smaller&amp;rsquo; scale comics (like Spider-Man) do so much better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/age-of-ultron-textbundle-f8d500.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit weird to be suddenly dropped into another universe with no idea what’s going on with all the characters I either know from the MCU or Ultimate line. But here we go!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yup. Definitely not in (Ultimate) Kansas any more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Crazy concept. Wonky time travel shenanigans. A decent solution. And yet another something happening after.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward to Cataclysm!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Spider-Man by Brian Michael Bendis, Volume 5</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/ultimate-comics-spider-man-by-brian-michael-bendis-volume-5/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/ultimate-comics-spider-man-by-brian-michael-bendis-volume-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>One Year Later.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Miles is done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But then (Ultimate) Cloak and Dagger show up:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-spider-man-5-textbundle-710540.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Origin story and all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Crazy comic action. Touching family scenes. Motivational speeches. It’s really good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Ultimates: Disassembled</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/14/ultimate-comics-ultimates-disassembled/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/14/ultimate-comics-ultimates-disassembled/</guid><description>&lt;p>Who would be the absolute worst person in the Ultimate Universe to get the Infinity Stones?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worse than that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now… both at once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a pretty crazy volume with some interesting twists and some big action pieces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But really, it’s just the beginning of the end. Cataclysm is coming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics: X-Men, by Brian Wood, Volume 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/14/ultimate-comics-x-men-by-brian-wood-volume-3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/14/ultimate-comics-x-men-by-brian-wood-volume-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two mutant homelands, Tian and Utopia. Well, apparently you can’t have that…&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Jean has never been the most stable personality, at last not in the Ultimate Universe. And… I get it. So much power, so young. And yet… she keeps causing more issues again and again. Oy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It all seems so sudden to escalate. And then in the way of comics—so suddenly over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and apparently the Sentient Seed dies again? Not sure what the point of that was either way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dreamer's Pool</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/13/dreamers-pool/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/13/dreamers-pool/</guid><description>&lt;p>A solid book.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There are three conditions you must agree to meet before I grant you this opportunity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Firstly, the considerable skill you possess must be used only for good. You will not let bitterness or anger draw you down the darker ways of your craft.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Secondly, if anyone asks for your help, you will give it willingly. I do not mean solely those who come to you for assistance with their ailments, but anyone at all who seeks your aid.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“And thirdly?” It occurred to me that I could be as good a liar as anyone. What was to stop me from agreeing now, and once I was out of here, doing whatever I pleased? I might yet live beyond dawn and see Mathuin brought down before nightfall. My heart began to race.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Thirdly, you will not seek vengeance. You will remain in Dalriada and stay away from Mathuin of Laois.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Take a bit of magic/folklore in an oldentimes Ireland; add in a Fae bargain (with all the complications that ensues); combine with a prince and princess who&amp;rsquo;ve never met outside of letters&amp;ndash;and seem entirely different in person; and finish it all off with fairy tale magic of Dreamer&amp;rsquo;s Pool.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wicked Lovely</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/wicked-lovely/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 17:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/wicked-lovely/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s YA Urban Fantasy. Don&amp;rsquo;t go in expecting anything earth shattering&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, wonder what in the world they&amp;rsquo;re all thinking, and have some fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not the best Urban Fantasy I&amp;rsquo;ve read, but it&amp;rsquo;s really not bad. The world-alongside-our-world of the Fae is fairly standard, the romance is mostly predictable, and there are few enough action scenes. But on the other hand, the world feels real enough, I liked Aislinn more than I had any right to, and I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued what happens next. And that&amp;rsquo;s more enough for a quick read in my opinion!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics: Iron Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/ultimate-comics-iron-man/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 17:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/ultimate-comics-iron-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>So much continues to change in the Post-Wave world&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead let’s introduce some new foe in the Mandarin. Hacking in and taking over Stark Tech. The Iron Man suit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neat idea but feels incomplete. Both in what I expected post Ultimatum and in the resolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics: X-Men, by Brian Wood, Volume 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/09/ultimate-comics-x-men-by-brian-wood-volume-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/09/ultimate-comics-x-men-by-brian-wood-volume-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Utopia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out, pretending the Sentient Seed died out lasted… not at all. Now there’s a new Mutant homeland in America…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-x-men-wood-2-textbundle-475838.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s actually really cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course Tian isn’t thrilled by the competition. It’s kind of amazing that after so long, Jean is still around. This has potential… but she’s starting with lies. I’m sure it will go well. Especially if she’s both hiding and going by her original name. Wat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it’s a neat story. If I didn’t know the Ultimate line was nearly over, I’d be intrigued. So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
