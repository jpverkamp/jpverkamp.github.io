&lt;p>Walk softly and carry a big stick. Or stomp loudly and carry enough firepower to start a small war. Whatever worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so continues the saga of Jane Yellowrock (and Beast!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, there&amp;rsquo;s a vampire plague, a new (old) vampire making a play for territory, and Jane accidentally making promises she certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean to&amp;ndash;and perhaps starting a war for her troubles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a solid book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Lions of Al-Rassan</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/21/the-lions-of-al-rassan/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/21/the-lions-of-al-rassan/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It was a day that would be remembered all her life by Jehane bet Ishak, the physician, for reasons over and above those of her fellow citizens in that proud, notoriously rebellious town: she lost her urine flask in the afternoon, and a part of her heart forever before the moons had set. The flask, for reasons of family history, was not a trivial matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That is a dense book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have a land in turmoil, warring city states, religious fervor, and the potential (perhaps a bit more than that) of a looming holy war.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Time and steady governance would bring Jad back into Al-Rassan, the king had declared, not burnings and destruction. Ibero wasn’t entirely sure how that meshed with holy doctrine, but he kept silent in the presence of his betters.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>You have a half dozen points of view, from a warrior poet to a general to a physician to a young boy and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I am increasingly unlikely to be best remembered, ibn Khairan decided ruefully, entering his home, for my poetry.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>All tangled together in one glorious tangle of a plot.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>King of Scars</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/20/king-of-scars/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/20/king-of-scars/</guid><description>&lt;p>All good things must end, it seems. We had our fun with Kaz and crew in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/">Six of Crows&lt;/a>. And now we shift focus once again, back to Ravka.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In some ways, it&amp;rsquo;s a continuation of the storyline of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a>, following the new King Nikolai as he deals with securing his throne in a nation deeply in debt with enemies on all sides. Plus, we get a lot more Zoya (who I did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> expect to like as much as I did) and at least some more of Genya and David (I do love their relationship).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another fascinating aspect of that storyline is that we get to dig much more into the mystical/religious underpinnings of the world. Six of Crows never really went there, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely something that came up in Shadow and Bone. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to feel like you know how magic works in the world&amp;ndash;and then realizing that you know nothing after all&amp;hellip; (both as a reader and as the characters).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will warn though: this part got &lt;em>weird&lt;/em>. All sorts of new and interesting (or I suppose old and interesting) metaphysics and magic we hadn&amp;rsquo;t really dug into before. A bit jarring&amp;ndash;both for the reader and for the characters involved&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a completely different direction, we also have a main storyline with Nina from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/">Six of Crows&lt;/a> (of all the characters, hers isn&amp;rsquo;t the first story I would have chosen to continue, but it is interesting). She&amp;rsquo;s still messed up / something new and now she&amp;rsquo;s off to Fjerda to continue to try to save the world. Newcomer Hanna is a lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a solid book. It&amp;rsquo;s weird how disjoint the two storylines are&amp;ndash;they don&amp;rsquo;t really interact at all, although I see how they&amp;rsquo;ll likely come together in [[todo:Rule of Wolves]]. I kept finding myself annoyed when we switch from one to another.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 5: The Shadow's Shadow</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/12/darth-vader-vol.-5-the-shadows-shadow/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/12/darth-vader-vol.-5-the-shadows-shadow/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sabe!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v5-textbundle-1f9451.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems the Handmaidens freed a number of former slaves from Tattooine. Including some familiar very minor characters from episode 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A great way to… blackmail Vader into doing a good thing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v5-textbundle-f081b2.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For all Vader touts order over chaos… he certainly does have a flair for shaking things up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also: an ‘artificial life force draining storm’ is so very Star Wars sounding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a fine story. Interesting to see the complexity Vader is struggling with even now/then.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 4: Crimson Reign</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/09/darth-vader-vol.-4-crimson-reign/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/09/darth-vader-vol.-4-crimson-reign/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v4-textbundle-6d8ec1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So forget Luke and Han Vader is apparently going after this Crimson Dawn now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v4-textbundle-99b49e.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They’re everywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Should be right up Vader’s alley.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add to that the return of Sabe. It’s an unexpectedly interesting way to tie into Vader’s past. One just had to wonder if/&lt;em>when&lt;/em> she’ll learn the truth of Vader’s identity…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still not quite as good as the first two volumes but an enjoyable read nevertheless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On thing I particularly enjoy about the comics is just how varied and alien the universe can feel:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v4-textbundle-5f40a5.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a nice contrast to how human centric the movies and shows have to be. Easier to draw a bug/lizard/ten foot ball droid than to put them on film.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 3: War of the Bounty Hunters</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/darth-vader-vol.-3-war-of-the-bounty-hunters/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/darth-vader-vol.-3-war-of-the-bounty-hunters/</guid><description>&lt;p>Vader is after Solo now…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v3-textbundle-a96877.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With some interesting “allies”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus an appearance by the one and only (I assume) IG-88!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Coolest part:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v3-textbundle-e568a4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vader getting &lt;del>hacked&lt;/del> sliced! He’s ‘more machine now than man’ so it fits. They could have done so much more with it…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The introduction (for me at least) of the Crimson Dawn is interesting as well. A Million Stronger than One. A neat idea to contrast the ‘only two there are’ Sith and the Big Damn Heroes of the Rebellion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit more out there than the previous two volumes but I enjoyed it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Raven Cursed</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/raven-cursed/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/raven-cursed/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“What you did today was self-defense. That man’s death might provide short-term protection for my brother, my master, and me. And so I thank you for the sacrifice of a small piece of your soul.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Jane is still up to here in Vampire politics&amp;ndash;with the complications of Witches and Weres for good measure. But at least now, she&amp;rsquo;s back home in North Carolina. That&amp;rsquo;s got to be worth something&amp;hellip; right?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 2: Into the Fire</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/06/darth-vader-vol.-2-into-the-fire/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/06/darth-vader-vol.-2-into-the-fire/</guid><description>&lt;p>Vader learned Luke was his son… and ran off across the Galaxy, tracking down anyone he could that might have hidden the truth from him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v2-textbundle-a28ead.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Emperor was not thrilled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So he tears Vader apart over again, sends him back to Mustafar (planet of his both in a way), and forbids him the force.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things only get more epic from here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a whirlwind of Vader passing test after trial, showing off just why he’s one of the most powerful beings in the Galaxy. Until we return to Exegol—2 years after the Rise of Skywalker; trying to fill in some of the mess that one made of continuity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vader is a weird choice for a protagonist, but likewise weirdly compelling. He is (at this point) unabashedly evil, yet I find myself rooting for him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 1: Dark Heart of the Sith</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/05/darth-vader-vol.-1-dark-heart-of-the-sith/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/05/darth-vader-vol.-1-dark-heart-of-the-sith/</guid><description>&lt;p>Darth Vader, shortly after Luke escapes him in The Empire Strikes Back. Realizing that perhaps he doesn’t actually &lt;em>know&lt;/em> what happened to Padme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Off to trawl through the past. With… quite the droid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v1-textbundle-108da3.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a fascinating look into Vader forced to dig into Anakin’s past. On Tattoine. On—and under—Naboo. Work the Handmaidens and other from Padme’s life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fascinating mix. I’m curious where it goes next!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: I can’t imagine reading these issue by issue… dang that’s a cliffhanger in issue 1…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dead Man Logan, Vol. 2: Welcome Back, Logan</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/04/dead-man-logan-vol.-2-welcome-back-logan/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/04/dead-man-logan-vol.-2-welcome-back-logan/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it ends as it began. Logan and a Hulk, in the Wastelands.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“Crows remember human faces. They remember the people who feed them, who are kind to them. And the people who wrong them too. They don’t forget. They tell each other who to look after and who to watch out for.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/">Six of Crows&lt;/a> took the world of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> and instead gave us one heck of a heist book. Really, it all circled around one big, impossible heist. Plan everything, get in, plans fall apart, make new plans, and pull off the impossible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s one heck of an impressive book and I really enjoyed it, but it left an awful lot of plot thread hanging open&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which makes Crooked Kingdom all the more cathartic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Six of Crows</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>No mourners.&lt;br>
No funerals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Among them, it passed for &amp;lsquo;good luck.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s such a good book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It takes the world of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> and completely ignores the at times overly YA political and religions machinations of that particular trilogy in favor of a somewhat darker and grittier heist novel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the most part, you really don&amp;rsquo;t need to have read Shadow and Bone first. There are a few references to the &amp;lsquo;Ravkan Civil War&amp;rsquo; and even to Sankta Alina, but other than that, it&amp;rsquo;s a new world. There are still Grisha, but they&amp;rsquo;re far less &amp;lsquo;miliary&amp;rsquo;, instead using (and hiding) their powers in all manner of interesting ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And while the heist elements were &lt;em>strong&lt;/em> (an impossible job, planning going absolutely sideways, and double triple crossing left and right) we also get all sorts of interesting backstory. Each of the main characters has chapters in their voice, but in the action going now, and explaining how they got into this mess in the first place. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot, but in a good way!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One gotcha is that, while the main heist plot is more than adequately contained in the book, it very much is the first half of a duology. It managed to just make me want to read the second&amp;hellip; but don&amp;rsquo;t go into this looking for a stand alone novel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what really shines are the characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dead Man Logan, Vol. 1: Sins of the Father</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/26/dead-man-logan-vol.-1-sins-of-the-father/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/26/dead-man-logan-vol.-1-sins-of-the-father/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so he has an expiration date:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/dead-man-logan-1-textbundle-1f9c64.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel like it’s been a long time coming. He either has to figure out some way to heal… or move on from this world that isn’t even his in the first place.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Betsy-Tacy and Tib</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/25/betsy-tacy-and-tib/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 20:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/25/betsy-tacy-and-tib/</guid><description>&lt;p>Betsy-Tacy and Tib is &amp;hellip; pretty much exactly what you&amp;rsquo;d expect. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/05/betsy-tacy/">Betsy-Tacy&lt;/a>, but now with more Tib. A new girl moves in, they become instant best friends, hijinks ensue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once again, it&amp;rsquo;s a delightful book to read with my own little one. I enjoy seeing what messes the children get into. And although they do get in trouble from time to time, we&amp;rsquo;re reminded that &lt;em>it&amp;rsquo;s okay to be children&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: my absolute favorite story is when they decide to cook. It goes as well as one might expect! 😄&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ruin and Rising</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/24/ruin-and-rising/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/24/ruin-and-rising/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh that&amp;rsquo;s quite an ending. After &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> set the stage and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/19/siege-and-storm/">Siege and Storm&lt;/a> raised the stakes, Ruin and Rising really brings everything home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have the increasing religious fever of Alina as Saint&amp;ndash;whether or not that&amp;rsquo;s what she wants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have what&amp;rsquo;s left of Alina&amp;rsquo;s friends and allies trying desperately to hold off the ever more powerful&amp;ndash;and ever more unhinged&amp;ndash;Darkling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We finally get some real history, digging deeper into where the Darkling came from&amp;hellip; and perhaps how Alina fits into it all as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have more adventures; a desperate bid to find the third Amplifier that may well save the day&amp;ndash;or doom them all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally&amp;ndash;obvious seeing as it&amp;rsquo;s the final novel in the trilogy&amp;ndash;we have victory. But at what cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s by a decent margin my favorite of the three. A solid conclusion, in my opinion. Now I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the other series in the same world. Six of Crows especially to see where those threads in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/25/shadow-and-bone-season-1/">the show&lt;/a> came from and King of Scars for a &amp;lsquo;what comes next&amp;rsquo;. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Siege and Storm</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/19/siege-and-storm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/19/siege-and-storm/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When people say impossible, they usually mean improbable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> had quite the ending. The Darkling showing his true allegiance, death and destruction, Alina and Mal on the run&amp;hellip; So of course in Siege and Storm they get captured by pirates (&lt;em>cough&lt;/em> I mean &lt;em>privateers&lt;/em>), the Darkling shows up again, they go meet the royal family, the Darkling shows up again, and in the end&amp;hellip; things just keep ending up getting worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s really a solid step up from Shadow and Bone. It&amp;rsquo;s still got a YA core, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely edging on the darker end of it all&amp;ndash;which I really enjoy. I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely looking forward to where this goes next!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 10: End of the World</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/15/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-10-end-of-the-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/15/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-10-end-of-the-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>Part one:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>‡ are my favorites, ∿ I listened to the audiobook. Full reviews + all reviews for each author are linked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ &lt;strong>Sequel (HM: Book 3+)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/the-infinite/">The Infinite&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/ada-hoffmann/">Ada Hoffmann&lt;/a>. Sci-fi with post-singularity AI acting as gods and a touch of cosmic horror. Interesting discussions about neurodiversity. My favorite of the series and a solid conclusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Mundane Jobs (Not on Earth)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/12/phoenix-extravagant/">Phoenix Extravagant&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/yoon-ha-lee/">Yoon Ha Lee&lt;/a>. A parallel to the China/Japan conflicts of a century ago and the jobs and sacrifices normal people (esp. artists) have to make during times of war and occupation. Also, Arazi (the dragon on the cover) really sells the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>Published in the 00s (HM: (HM: Not top 30 on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/11mvwsa/rfantasy_top_novels_2023_results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this list&lt;/a>)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/21/throne-of-jade/">Throne of Jade&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/naomi-novik/">Naomi Novik&lt;/a>. What if the Napoleanic Wars, but with DRAGONS. This one now with more travel to China. It&amp;rsquo;s a neat concept and I like throughout the series how the idea is explored in a number of different cultures, although as the series goes on, it starts to wear a bit thin. Temeraire and Laurence (dragon and &amp;hellip; handler? it&amp;rsquo;s complicated) are really the soul of these books. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/temeraire/">Temeraire&lt;/a> is the first book in the series; but I&amp;rsquo;d previously read that years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ &lt;strong>Angels and Demons (HM: Protagonist)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/24/good-omens-the-nice-and-accurate-prophecies-of-agnes-nutter-witch/">Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/neil-gaiman/">Neil Gaiman&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/terry-pratchett/">Terry Pratchett&lt;/a>. A mix of the wonderful worldbuilding of Pratchett and Gaiman that builds on both their strengths to build a fun ride, political/religious in exactly that fun somewhat blasphemous irreverent sort of way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bottom of TBR&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/01/blindsight/">Blindsight&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/peter-watts/">Peter Watts&lt;/a>. Vampires. In Space. It&amp;rsquo;s such a bonkers idea that I want more of it. Plus you get a surprisingly solid scientific reasoning for a lot of Vampire myths, a discussion on AI and the Chinese Room argument, talk about multiple personalities. It&amp;rsquo;s dense and a bit chaotic and weird. I liked it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Horror (HM: Not King or Lovecraft)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/07/prodigal-son/">Prodigal Son&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/dean-koontz/">Dean Koontz&lt;/a>. What if Frankenstein survived into the modern era and tried to conquer the world Invasion of the Frankenbodysnatchers style. It&amp;rsquo;s a solid Dean Koontz book, which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t read in years now. The problem is that it tries to fit far too many threads into one story and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really work without the sequels (and only barely works with them). Another book dealing with autism, dealt with mostly well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ &lt;strong>Coastal or Island Setting (HM: Features Seafaring)&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/19/tress-of-the-emerald-sea/">Tress of the Emerald Sea&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/brandon-sanderson/">Brandon Sanderson&lt;/a>. The feel of Princess Bride told through through the narrative lense of Hoid (which won&amp;rsquo;t make the least bit of sense if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read much of Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s Cosmere I suppose). I&amp;rsquo;ve read and enjoyed just about all of Sanderson and he&amp;rsquo;s got 4 novels out this year, so of course I have to use one of them. It&amp;rsquo;s delightful, touching little story and probably worth a read even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the rest of Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s work, although the ending will be weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>Queernorm Setting (HM: Not Futuristic)&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/03/under-the-whispering-door/">Under the Whispering Door&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/t.j.-klune/">T.J. Klune&lt;/a>. So… what do you call a slice of life story when the protagonist dies at the end of the first chapter? Whatever you do, Under the Whispering Door is a delightful example thereof. Despite taking place within our world, I would say it&amp;rsquo;s Queernorm within the much reduced setting of the story (the tea house and this specific corner of the afterishlife).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Set in the Middle East (HM: By an author of Middle Eastern heritage)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/07/girl-serpent-thorn/">Girl, Serpent, Thorn&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/melissa-bashardoust/">Melissa Bashardoust&lt;/a>. Take Persian mythology and worldbuilding, more than a touch of fairy tale feel, a cursed princess, demons, div (what in a Euro-centric story would be probably be fae), a touch of romance, and the spark of revolution. It’s an interesting world, an interesting premise, and you really want everything to go right in the end. I like the variety of non-humans. They feel the same as dozens of stories I read before–and yet, being based on a different set of myths and legends, different. All at the same time. It’s fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Title with a Title (HM: Not Royalty)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/09/the-handmaids-tale/">The Handmaid&amp;#39;s Tale&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/margaret-atwood/">Margaret Atwood&lt;/a>. Take the extremist end of the American Protestant religious right. Give them everything they want (plus some) over the span of years (if not months). Like any good story of this sort, it takes a potential problem–an idea–and turns it up to eleven. It goes steps further than anything we’ve seen in modern times–or at least differently. And all the more telling when you feel people in today&amp;rsquo;s world taking it as inspiration rather than a cautionary tale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Superheroes (HM: Not DC or Marvel)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/12/zeroes/">Zeroes&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/scott-westerfield/">Scott Westerfield&lt;/a>. The story of six American teenagers who discover they have superpowers. What I like most perhaps was the entire idea of the title: “Zeroes, not Heroes”. They’re not superheroes. (oops, guess it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit after all). I also enjoyed how diverse the cast was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Magical Realism or Literary Fantasy (HM: Not from &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/4bhiua/proposed_magical_realism_recommendation_list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this list&lt;/a>)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/16/the-cartographers/">The Cartographers&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/peng-shepherd/">Peng Shepherd&lt;/a>. Plus side: I love the premise. Take the idea of phantom settlements / copyright traps. Now make it so that if you happen to have the right map–you can actually get to those phantom settlements. I may have to check out Paper Towns. Minus side: it takes forever to actually get to the magic of the book. You (as the reader) are sure there’s more to them than you’d think, either having read the blurb–or just being aware of the book’s genre. But for how magical a concept it is, we barely get anything to do with them until halfway through the book and even then we’re only touching the surface. I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s Magical Realism for you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>Multiverse and Alternate Realities (HM: Not through a literal door)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/18/the-space-between-worlds/">The Space Between Worlds&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/micaiah-johnson/">Micaiah Johnson&lt;/a>. Hopping between worlds–with one big caveat. If you visit a world where another you is still alive, you die. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating digging into the idea that the best world hoppers are those raised under circumstances where they &lt;em>should have died&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Myths and Retellings (HM: Not Greek or Roman)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/23/the-witchs-heart/">The Witch&amp;#39;s Heart&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/genevieve-gornichec/">Genevieve Gornichec&lt;/a>. It seems no matter the culture, myths and legends get weird. Norse mythology is absolutely no exception to that. In this story, we have a novelization of the story of Angrboda. Wife of Loki. Mother of monsters. She’s been around a while (it’s mythology, even she doesn’t know how long) and she just wants to be left alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>Set in Space (HM: Not from Earth)&lt;/strong> (replacing Book Bingo/Readalong): &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/house-of-suns/">House of Suns&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/alastair-reynolds/">Alastair Reynolds&lt;/a>. In House of Suns, we have the story of a small subset of humanity writ large. The speed of light is the ultimate limit. Planets are decades apart; the galaxy hundreds of thousands of years around. So how do you continue that oh so human drive for exploration and expansion? Well in House of Suns, you create a thousand clones. Imprint them all with your memories. And send them out into the universe. Set it up so that ever few decades/centuries/millenia, they meet up, share all they’ve been to. What other branches of humanity have risen–or fallen? What other miracles of technology have been discovered? Who’s fallen in love? Sci-fi at it&amp;rsquo;s finest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Druids (HM: Not Iron Druid)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/13/dreamers-pool/">Dreamer&amp;#39;s Pool&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/juliet-marillier/">Juliet Marillier&lt;/a>. Take a bit of magic/folklore in an oldentimes Ireland; add in a Fae bargain (with all the complications that ensues); combine with a prince and princess who’ve never met outside of letters–and seem entirely different in person; and finish it all off with fairy tale magic of Dreamer’s Pool. It&amp;rsquo;s got an interesting cast and a nice fairy tale sort of plot, if a bit incomplete feeling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Mythical Beasts (HM: Not dragons)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/18/the-last-unicorn/">The Last Unicorn&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/peter-s.-beagle/">Peter S. Beagle&lt;/a>. It’s one of those books that just feels like a fairy tale. An ageless story. A story passed down from long ago ages of myth and fantasy. Ages with heroes and villains and wizards and–you guessed it–unicorns. It’s beautifully written (for the most part; there are certainly parts that feel overdone), chock full of wonderfully fantastic descriptions and metaphors that just sort of stick around. I really enjoy the characters, especially the titular Last Unicorn&amp;ndash;they don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> human; which I appreciate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Featuring Robots (HM: Robot protagonist)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/lock-in/">Lock In&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/john-scalzi/">John Scalzi&lt;/a>. A near future Earth where a flu-like pandemic (Haden’s Syndrome) has caused locked-in syndrome in some small percent of the world’s population (a small percent of billions is still an awful lot of people). Those affected are completely paralyzed, unable to move, while still being fully aware and conscious. Luckily(ish) a massive global effort has figured out how to embed computer hardware in their brains so as to allow them to remotely pilot either robotic bodies (threeps) or (more rarely) other humans who’ve allowed them access. This of course is widely accepted by the rest of humanity and causes no issues whatsoever. It&amp;rsquo;s arguable if the human minds in robotic bodies (the threeps) counts for the square, but if Murderbot counts, I would think this does too? It&amp;rsquo;s their body (although that&amp;rsquo;s a decent plot point in itself).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Novella (HM: Not Tordotcom)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/26/six-gun-snow-white/">Six-Gun Snow White&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/catherynne-m.-valente/">Catherynne M. Valente&lt;/a>. Take (the vague outline) the story of Snow White. Make it a Western. Things get weird. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting premise and certainly an interesting writing style&amp;ndash;although not my favorite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>5 SFF Shorts (HM: An Anthology)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/30/stories-of-your-life-and-others/">Stories of Your Life and Others&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/ted-chiang/">Ted Chiang&lt;/a>. Story of Your Life became the film Arrival, which got me to read the book. The rest are also really good, including some really interesting alternate takes on religion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>YA (HM: Published in the last 5 years)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/04/a-wizards-guide-to-defensive-baking/">A Wizard&amp;#39;s Guide to Defensive Baking&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/t.-kingfisher/">T. Kingfisher&lt;/a>. A world with weirdly specialized sorts of wizards. You might be able to cast lightning bolts… or you might have the power to animate and converse with dead horses. Or you might even have magical powers over… bread! It’s such a delightful idea and Kingfisher manages to do all sorts of fun things with it. Some obvious (Mongo eat your gingerbread heart out), some less so (Bob the sourdough starter; so delightful). I need to read more Kingfisher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>POC Author (HM: Furturistic Sci/fi)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/06/rosewater/">Rosewater&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/tade-thompson/">Tade Thompson&lt;/a>. A fascinating premise. Take the world a half century in the future. Most things are the same, but there’s a bit more tech floating around, mostly. Introduce a massive alien organism that lands in London and ends up burrowing it’s way to Nigeria. From that alien blob, fill the atmosphere with alien microorganisms/cells that create their own xenosphere, enabling (among other things) psychic powers in some very small proportion of the population. Writ rather more gritty than I was expecting with a complicated structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Self/Indie published (HM: Fewer than 100 ratings)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/10/the-book-of-zog/">The Book of Zog&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/alec-hutson/">Alec Hutson&lt;/a>. Zogrusz is an Eldrich Horror, a being from beyond time and space. But… a nice one? That just wants to do the right thing? It&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly adorable with some interesting cosmic level universebuilding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Elemental Magic (HM: Not Shades of Magic or Codex Alera)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/leigh-bardugo/">Leigh Bardugo&lt;/a>. Rather YA and the TV show is better (partially because it pulls from the other series in the same world as well). But I did enjoy the Russian influenced worldbuilding and the slightly more flexible than many YA contemporaries groupings. Has a lot of potential for the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Published in 2023 (HM: Debut)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/14/the-scourge-between-stars/">The Scourge Between Stars&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/ness-brown/">Ness Brown&lt;/a>. A generation ship with something going bump in the night? Isn&amp;rsquo;t it always night in space? In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s nicely terrifying if rather short (at novella length). Feels &lt;em>very&lt;/em> similar to Alien, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a bad thing. A solid debut.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(I originally read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/29/venco/">VenCo&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/cherie-dimaline/">Cherie Dimaline&lt;/a> for this spot, but realized as I was writing this post that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit hard mode.)&lt;/p>

To get us out of it, we sent a generation ship to the stars. But when we got there&amp;hellip; it wasn&amp;rsquo;t any better, so they turned around to go home. On the way back&amp;hellip; well, we just might not be alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A generation ship is a great setting for a sci-fi/horror mashup. There really is nowhere to run but plenty of places to hide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea of things lurking out there between the stars? Terrifying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The feel of the book, especially as it ratchets up to the big reveal/fight scenes throughout the ship? Excellent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the only real problems I had with the book were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It was too short! Novella length, but the premise alone could certainly fill a novel.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The technology was a bit odd at times (what exactly are they doing with &amp;lsquo;jumps&amp;rsquo;?)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;span class="spoiler">The things in the dark between stars not actually being the monster? Awesome. But... what were they then?&lt;/span>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Worth a read though! A debut author worth following.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Yumi and the Nightmare Painter</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/14/yumi-and-the-nightmare-painter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/14/yumi-and-the-nightmare-painter/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh Sanderson. How &lt;em>do&lt;/em> you do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three of the four novels in the &amp;ldquo;Year of Sanderson&amp;rdquo;. Tress was amazing and if anything&amp;hellip; Yumi is even better. (Frugal Wizard was fine. 😄)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shadow and Bone</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/</guid><description>&lt;p>Browsing through Netflix last fall, I came upon &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/25/shadow-and-bone-season-1/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a>. Watched it. Quite enjoyed it. Figured I should read the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s not bad, but I enjoyed the show more. For one, it pulls in Kaz and co, which don&amp;rsquo;t appear in this novel at all (they&amp;rsquo;re originally from the related Six of Crows books), which is a bummer. For two, the additional dynamic of Alina as half-Shu in addition to being an orphan added rather a lot to her character.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Book of Zog</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/10/the-book-of-zog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/10/the-book-of-zog/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The man scowled, but Zogrusz sensed a slight softening in his mood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I understand, stranger. I remember my first time in this room, when I felt His presence looming over me. But you cannot so blithely stroke the visage of our dread lord! Such disrespect might summon His wrath, and all of Xochintl would suffer.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“What delightful nonsense!” Zogrusz exclaimed, clapping his hands together. “Did you make it up yourself?”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Zogrusz is an Eldrich Horror, a being from beyond time and space. But&amp;hellip; a nice one? That just wants to do the right thing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book follows Zog and the quasi-Earth (it&amp;rsquo;s never entirely clear) he settles on through thousands of years (mostly with large time jumps) and the rise and fall of various religions up to (and through) and approaching cosmic horror style end of the world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mercy Blade</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/09/mercy-blade/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/09/mercy-blade/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty of chances in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/18/skinwalker/">Skinwalker&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/27/blood-cross/">Blood Cross&lt;/a> to get used to the Vampires, Witches, and &amp;hellip; well Jane and Beast of the world. We&amp;rsquo;ve even barely started to scratch the surface for how Vampires work and how they came to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So of course things have to get &lt;em>complicated&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 9: The Hunter and the Hunted</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/07/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-9-the-hunter-and-the-hunted/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/07/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-9-the-hunter-and-the-hunted/</guid><description>&lt;p>The hand returns…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-9-textbundle-31ffad.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, not that Hand. Logan’s hand. The one with the adamantium claws. I’ve actually enjoyed seeing him with the mismatched claws for a few volumes now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bit of a bummer, other than that. More spinning wheels with nowhere to go for Old Man Logan.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rosewater</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/06/rosewater/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/06/rosewater/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The idea of a singular hero and a manifest destiny just makes us lazy. There is no destiny. There is choice, there is action, and any other narrative perpetuates a myth that someone else out there will fix our problems with a magic sword and a blessing from the gods.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Rosewater has a fascinating premise. Take the world a half century in the future. Most things are the same, but there&amp;rsquo;s a bit more tech floating around, mostly. Introduce a massive alien organism that lands in London and ends up burrowing it&amp;rsquo;s way to Nigeria. From that alien blob, fill the atmosphere with alien microorganisms/cells that create their own xenosphere, enabling (among other things) psychic powers in some very small proportion of the population.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 8: To Kill For</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/05/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-8-to-kill-for/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/05/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-8-to-kill-for/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-8-textbundle-093e2f.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First half: Kingpin has gone all respectable! On the surface. Again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s impressive that keeps working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bullseye is a weird character. Logan’s eye is not healing. And that’s about it&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second half: An Old Geezer and some Z-list X-Men defend the school from… dating site scams?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cute. But also nothing special.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/04/a-wizards-guide-to-defensive-baking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/04/a-wizards-guide-to-defensive-baking/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“It is nearly impossibly to be sad when eating a blueberry muffin. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that&amp;rsquo;s a scientific fact.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I need to read more &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/t.-kingfisher/">T. Kingfisher&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/01/nettle-bone/">Nettle &amp;amp; Bone&lt;/a> was delightful and, if anything, A Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Defensive Baking is even better!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, we have a world with a specialized sorts of wizards. You might be able to cast lightning bolts&amp;hellip; or you might have the power to animate and converse with dead horses. Or you &lt;em>might&lt;/em> even have magical powers over&amp;hellip; bread!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>That’s a hot mess of a story—although some of that is probably not really having the background for who a lot of these people are. So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was nice actually (sort of) seeing Logan deal with the slower healing factor. I feel like though most of this we’ve heard of it, but no real problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fun enough read.

&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t often read anthologies, but perhaps I should read more. I do love me some epic fantasy (I&amp;rsquo;ve read the entire &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-wheel-of-time/">The Wheel of Time&lt;/a> half a dozen times now&amp;hellip;), but there&amp;rsquo;s just something about a story that builds up quickly, gets to the point, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t stick around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think of the 8, I only bounced off 1 (which was actually a fine story, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t suspend disbelief enough for the premise) and 1 was a bit meh, just for how short it was. 6 of 8 I absolutely loved though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Absolutely worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VenCo</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/29/venco/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/29/venco/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Hold on a minute,” Lucky said. So far, the stories weren’t making things any clearer. “I don’t get it. Did someone give us the spoons?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Well, yes, in a manner of speaking,” Meena said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“But I found mine. You both found yours.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“In a secret tunnel off your basement?” Lettie replied. “Really? Hanging from a spider web in a graveyard on a specific day?
At the bottom of a box of donated books? Statistically improbable.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Never mind probability, what about the laws of nature? The world cannot be just a series of randoms,” Freya chimed in. “Might as well believe in some beardo in the sky.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a book about spoons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And witches, of course.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Well, I know there are Wiccans, right? Like a religion?” No one gave her any indication she was on the right path, so she kept talking. “And there are Halloween witches—like vampires and demons and all that. And I know about the bullshit witch trials. Thousands of women burned at the stake for being smart or queer or loud. I guess that’s about it.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But really about spoons.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blood Cross</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/27/blood-cross/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/27/blood-cross/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/18/skinwalker/">Skinwalker&lt;/a> we were introduced to Jane/Beast/and the various things that go bump in the New Orleans night.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>From that day forward she never used my name. Eventually I forgot it. Mrs. H called me something new.

&lt;p>It didn’t matter where you were, if you were in a room full of books you were at least halfway home.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/16/the-magicians/">The Magicians&lt;/a>, we had half Harry Potter &lt;em>but cynical&lt;/em> and half Narnia&amp;hellip; &lt;em>but cynical&lt;/em>. In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/20/the-magician-king/">The Magician King&lt;/a>, we mostly stuck around in Fillory (the Narnia analogue). But right at the end&amp;hellip; our well loved (:sarcasm:) main character Quentin pays the ultimate price: he doesn&amp;rsquo;t get to hang out in the magical land anymore and has to go home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Magician&amp;rsquo;s Land picks up from there, with one plot following Quentin as he settles back into a normal life, becomes a teacher, promptly gets fired, and descends to a life of crime. As one does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, we have the (new and improved?) Kings and Queens of Fillory dealingw ith their own sort of armageddon.

&lt;p>Apparently in all the wacky parallel universe shenanigans, Maestro “rescued” a bunch of Hulks and brought them back to this world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowing basically nothing about how Maestro came to be or what all these Hulks can actually do, it’s a strange story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Magician King</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/20/the-magician-king/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/20/the-magician-king/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>That was the thing about the world: it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that things were harder than you thought they were going to be, it was that they were hard in ways that you didn&amp;rsquo;t expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Turns out, if you take &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/16/the-magicians/">The Magicians&lt;/a>, tone down Quentin a bit, and cut the magic school parts to focus mostly on Fillory and adventuring, you get a much better book. It&amp;rsquo;s still a bit much at times and definitely has some &amp;lsquo;middle book syndrome&amp;rsquo; going on, but I quite enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you didn&amp;rsquo;t like the Magicians, you might like this book.

&lt;p>This can’t possibly go well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially when none of his “friends” will help, so he has to turn to darker sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we end up with is Logan bouncing (again) through time, reliving his old adventures for a few pages at a time, unable to change anything that matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s an interesting idea, but once again it doesn’t really have time to breath.

I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for a good new (to me) Urban Fantasy&amp;ndash;and Jane Yellowrock (so far) hits all the right notes. The worldbuilding is neat. The plot is basic enough, but solid. I like the main character(s). And I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing where it goes from here!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the biggest/really only negative with the book is that the writing style starts out fairly rough.

&lt;p>I got my heart&amp;rsquo;s desire, and there my troubles began.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well. The majority of comments certainly nailed this one. Two interesting premises in a trenchcoat wrapped in the guise of cynicism and dark humor, underscored by the most depressed to the point of hard to read main character I think I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a long time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Fascinating… and bloody. But that’s Wolverine for you.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yeah… I’m not sure what else he thought might happen.&lt;/p>

Until a freak airship accident&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> kills the Emperor and all of his early heirs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suddenly, Maia is thrust into a whole new life. A life of money and power; but also a life without privacy, a life that he has &lt;em>absolutely&lt;/em> no idea how to deal with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For better or for worse, The Goblin Emperor has surprisingly low stakes. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a book about the new emperor standing against invasion. It&amp;rsquo;s not about some world ending threat. It&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em>really&lt;/em> even about traitors trying to take the throne&amp;ndash;although that one at least we get a bit of&lt;sup id="fnref1:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I actually really like it. It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;lsquo;slice of life&amp;rsquo; (a genre I&amp;rsquo;ve recently really started to love), where the life is that of a new Emperor. Who happens to be a (half-)Goblin.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 1: Berzerker</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/05/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-1-berzerker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/05/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-1-berzerker/</guid><description>&lt;p>And now, after &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/03/wolverine-old-man-logan/">Wolverine: Old Man Logan&lt;/a> in the apocalyptic future and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/04/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-0-warzones/">Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 0: Warzones!&lt;/a> in Battleworld, we&amp;rsquo;re finally back in the present&amp;ndash;and, I assume, in the main universe?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Old Man Logan of course goes straight from shock to murder. If he&amp;rsquo;s in the past (from his own point of view), well then of course he&amp;rsquo;s going to have to &lt;em>fix the future&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-1-210d15.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if this isn&amp;rsquo;t actually &lt;em>his&lt;/em> past? What if it isn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>his&lt;/em> future that he&amp;rsquo;s setting out to change?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat idea, but a bit thin on execution. I would have rather him kick up a bit more trouble before starting to figure things out. Seeing an equally old Captain America (no idea what the story was there) was neat. But the real amusing part is the apart team up with Kate Bishop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-1-a65f7c.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not at all who I would have picked&amp;hellip; but amusing!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to think. I really liked the &lt;em>world&lt;/em> of Old Man Logan. Now we have Logan without that world. Bit of a bait and switch, but I suppose it has potential.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating bit of story, with poor &amp;lsquo;Old Man&amp;rsquo; Logan bouncing between a world (or two) where the X-Men live, a world where anyone not in Iron man armor contracts a techno virus, and a world of the dead.
On the other hand, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really go anywhere&amp;ndash;not until we get to Secret Wars itself.</description></item><item><title>Spells for Forgetting</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/03/spells-for-forgetting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/03/spells-for-forgetting/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mom had gotten better through the years at blending in and appearing at first glance like other mothers. But she still spent the equinox in the woods and the solstice at the sea.

&lt;p>Take the idea of a used bookstore in San Francisco. Give it an awesome name. Skinny, but three stories tall (and I imagine, open all the way up rather than having 3 actual floors). Add a mysterious &amp;lsquo;back&amp;rsquo; section, where strange people come to &amp;lsquo;borrow&amp;rsquo; strange books. Some sort of secret society? A merging of new* technologies&amp;ndash;e-readers! search engines! OCR! book scanning!&amp;ndash;and archaic&amp;ndash;books! printing presses! actually; that&amp;rsquo;s about it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s got the seeds of what should have been a great story!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really do love the early setting of the book. It&amp;rsquo;s got a perfect magical feel to it. I really want to visit Mr. Penumbra&amp;rsquo;s!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But unfortunately, from there (and in my opinion), it goes somewhat off the rails. Everything feels too each. The characters are all a bit &amp;rsquo;too much&amp;rsquo;. The technology (a big part of the book) all feels slightly off. The big reveal is &amp;hellip; meh?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting premise stretched thin.

&lt;p>I think that I really like the Marvel stories that take place a bit further from our own world&amp;ndash;gives them a chance to really change things up. And multiple universes lets you have characters you know and love&amp;ndash;and brutally murder them. Always a good time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“I knew about faeries. They didn’t,” she protested. She hated the faery inability to lie more and more as he spoke. It would be easier to lie and deny how painlessly she had become fey.

&lt;p>For every nine years, the fold from Beyond the Wall and over the hill set up their stalls, and for a day and a night the meadow played host to the Faerie market; and there was, for one day and one night in nine years, commerce between the nations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I do love Neil Gaiman&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. He does weird/creepy/dark perfectly well. Stardust is a great example of &lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a dark fairy tale, a la the Brothers Grimm. A city on the border between Victorian England and Fairie. The contrast of worlds. An adventure full of princes and witches, woodland animals, magic, and of course: fairy tale love.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a great listen. A bit weird, since apparently it was also originally published in graphic novel format and is also supposed to be a great movie.

&lt;p>“Time,” he said solemnly, “is comparable to a river flowing under a layer of ice. It stretches us out like water weeds, from root to tip, from birth to death, curled around whatever rocks or snags happen to lie in our path; and no one can get out of the river because of the ice roof, and no one can turn back against the current for an instant.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have a magical mishap that blows holes in time, secret societies at each other&amp;rsquo;s throats, beggers&amp;rsquo; guilds, poets, time traveling tourism, and body swapping shenanigans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s certainly a longer read, yet even with the runtime I found myself wanting more in certain areas.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
