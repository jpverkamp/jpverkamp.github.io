&lt;p>Nah, Future Foundation!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a really weird story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Random incursions from random dimensions. Animal people. Cyclops super heroes. Atlanteans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And oy talk about tonal whiplash. Death and doom to animal people to kidnapping to quippy one liners to rape. All over the place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally, the art. It starts off, a bit unfinished… but I kind of like it. But then it gets even more unfinished and cartoony. Not a fan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a vaguely interesting story wrapped up in a lot of weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not surprised this is all it got.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Brave New World</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/brave-new-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/brave-new-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of those novels that it seems many were assigned in High School reading, but I never actually read. Figured it was probably about time. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, take the modern world and turn a number of interesting trends up to 11. Dissolve family ties. Genetically engineer children as a sort of uber-caste system. Make sex purely recreational. Add to that the perspective of &amp;rsquo;the Savage&amp;rsquo;. One raised on a reservation without this &amp;lsquo;modern&amp;rsquo; world&amp;ndash;giving an outsider&amp;rsquo;s perspective to all the changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the craziest thing is that this book was written in 1932&amp;hellip; Oddly prescient that. It could extrapolate from today&amp;rsquo;s world about as easily as the world of almost a century ago. Probably a bit more influence from the Internet and social media; perhaps more commentary on how the sexual revolution in Brave New World compares to what actually happened in the decades after the book&amp;rsquo;s release. But I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what else I&amp;rsquo;d see changed. A mark of good distopian sci-fi, that. For better or for worse.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/cataclysm-the-ultimates-last-stand/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/cataclysm-the-ultimates-last-stand/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another giant story; the second &amp;lsquo;biggest&amp;rsquo; of the Ultimate Marvel Universe&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/cataclysm-textbundle-bf6180.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Uh oh. Gah Lak Tus? Time to meet GALACTUS!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m sure this will go well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being titled Cataclysm—and the last in the Ultimate Marvel Universe line—after all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The X-Men’s involvement? Meh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spider-Man? Pretty awesome. Touching and personal, even in the face of a giant purple guy with a fancy hat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ultimates: what is with that art style? Everyone getting infected with Galactus is amusing. Purple Hulk!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ultimates Last Stand? The meat of the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reed Richard&amp;rsquo;s redemption arc (of a sort)? What&amp;hellip; he does not deserve that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s kind of a deus ex solution to an impossible problem. But that’s sort of the way with comics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/cataclysm-textbundle-97dfbe.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or … maybe it is?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Age of Ultron: The Complete Event</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/age-of-ultron-the-complete-event/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/age-of-ultron-the-complete-event/</guid><description>&lt;p>So this was on the list of &amp;lsquo;Ultimate Marvel reading order&amp;rsquo;, primarily as a lead in to the events of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/cataclysm-the-ultimates-last-stand/">Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand&lt;/a>. That was not necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel like most of these &amp;lsquo;big events&amp;rsquo; have ended up being overwhelming. They just need more room to breathe than comics can give them. The &amp;lsquo;smaller&amp;rsquo; scale comics (like Spider-Man) do so much better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/age-of-ultron-textbundle-f8d500.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit weird to be suddenly dropped into another universe with no idea what’s going on with all the characters I either know from the MCU or Ultimate line. But here we go!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/age-of-ultron-textbundle-7edd25.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yup. Definitely not in (Ultimate) Kansas any more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Crazy concept. Wonky time travel shenanigans. A decent solution. And yet another something happening after.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward to Cataclysm!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Spider-Man by Brian Michael Bendis, Volume 5</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/ultimate-comics-spider-man-by-brian-michael-bendis-volume-5/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/ultimate-comics-spider-man-by-brian-michael-bendis-volume-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>One Year Later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-spider-man-5-textbundle-d8a1ae.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Miles is done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But then (Ultimate) Cloak and Dagger show up:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-spider-man-5-textbundle-710540.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Origin story and all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Crazy comic action. Touching family scenes. Motivational speeches. It’s really good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Ultimates: Disassembled</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/14/ultimate-comics-ultimates-disassembled/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/14/ultimate-comics-ultimates-disassembled/</guid><description>&lt;p>Who would be the absolute worst person in the Ultimate Universe to get the Infinity Stones?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worse than that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now… both at once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a pretty crazy volume with some interesting twists and some big action pieces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But really, it’s just the beginning of the end. Cataclysm is coming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics: X-Men, by Brian Wood, Volume 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/14/ultimate-comics-x-men-by-brian-wood-volume-3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/14/ultimate-comics-x-men-by-brian-wood-volume-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two mutant homelands, Tian and Utopia. Well, apparently you can’t have that…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-x-men-wood-3-textbundle-5d58e0.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jean has never been the most stable personality, at last not in the Ultimate Universe. And… I get it. So much power, so young. And yet… she keeps causing more issues again and again. Oy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It all seems so sudden to escalate. And then in the way of comics—so suddenly over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and apparently the Sentient Seed dies again? Not sure what the point of that was either way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dreamer's Pool</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/13/dreamers-pool/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/13/dreamers-pool/</guid><description>&lt;p>A solid book.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There are three conditions you must agree to meet before I grant you this opportunity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Firstly, the considerable skill you possess must be used only for good. You will not let bitterness or anger draw you down the darker ways of your craft.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Secondly, if anyone asks for your help, you will give it willingly. I do not mean solely those who come to you for assistance with their ailments, but anyone at all who seeks your aid.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“And thirdly?” It occurred to me that I could be as good a liar as anyone. What was to stop me from agreeing now, and once I was out of here, doing whatever I pleased? I might yet live beyond dawn and see Mathuin brought down before nightfall. My heart began to race.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Thirdly, you will not seek vengeance. You will remain in Dalriada and stay away from Mathuin of Laois.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Take a bit of magic/folklore in an oldentimes Ireland; add in a Fae bargain (with all the complications that ensues); combine with a prince and princess who&amp;rsquo;ve never met outside of letters&amp;ndash;and seem entirely different in person; and finish it all off with fairy tale magic of Dreamer&amp;rsquo;s Pool.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wicked Lovely</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/wicked-lovely/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 17:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/wicked-lovely/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s YA Urban Fantasy. Don&amp;rsquo;t go in expecting anything earth shattering&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, wonder what in the world they&amp;rsquo;re all thinking, and have some fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not the best Urban Fantasy I&amp;rsquo;ve read, but it&amp;rsquo;s really not bad. The world-alongside-our-world of the Fae is fairly standard, the romance is mostly predictable, and there are few enough action scenes. But on the other hand, the world feels real enough, I liked Aislinn more than I had any right to, and I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued what happens next. And that&amp;rsquo;s more enough for a quick read in my opinion!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics: Iron Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/ultimate-comics-iron-man/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 17:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/ultimate-comics-iron-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>So much continues to change in the Post-Wave world&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead let’s introduce some new foe in the Mandarin. Hacking in and taking over Stark Tech. The Iron Man suit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neat idea but feels incomplete. Both in what I expected post Ultimatum and in the resolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics: X-Men, by Brian Wood, Volume 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/09/ultimate-comics-x-men-by-brian-wood-volume-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/09/ultimate-comics-x-men-by-brian-wood-volume-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Utopia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out, pretending the Sentient Seed died out lasted… not at all. Now there’s a new Mutant homeland in America…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-x-men-wood-2-textbundle-475838.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s actually really cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course Tian isn’t thrilled by the competition. It’s kind of amazing that after so long, Jean is still around. This has potential… but she’s starting with lies. I’m sure it will go well. Especially if she’s both hiding and going by her original name. Wat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it’s a neat story. If I didn’t know the Ultimate line was nearly over, I’d be intrigued. So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>House of Suns</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/house-of-suns/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/house-of-suns/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Everything came and went, everything was new and bright with promise once and old and worn out later, and everything left a small, diminishing stain on eternity, a mark that time would eventually erase.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>House of Suns is what really great sci-fi tries to be: it takes some fascinating ideas (generally technological), sprinkles in interesting characters (although some authors seem to find that optional), and goes from there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Wolverine: Legacies</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/ultimate-comics-wolverine-legacies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/ultimate-comics-wolverine-legacies/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jimmy gets a hidden message in that hidden message with his father.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enough to reveal a tiny bit of Wolverine’s past, how Jimmy came to be (almost graphically), and who his mother/family is…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why does everyone have to be related?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a one off, meh. In the greater storyline, too late.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skip-able, unless you’re going for completion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics: X-Men, by Brian Wood, Volume 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/05/ultimate-comics-x-men-by-brian-wood-volume-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/05/ultimate-comics-x-men-by-brian-wood-volume-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>So here we go again again (again?). Another Volume 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It could have been an interesting story. The Mutant Cure. The last 20 or so mutants (in the US/public). Divisions even among them. A Mutant Seed that can cure world hunger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it’s all moving so fast I barely even have a chance to get to know anyone we didn’t already know. And those left feel different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this has been the start of Ultimate X-Men, opening with Ultimatum? That would have been cool. As it is? Meh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost to the end. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Ultimates by Sam Humphries, Vol. 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/ultimate-comics-ultimates-by-sam-humphries-vol.-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/ultimate-comics-ultimates-by-sam-humphries-vol.-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>President Cap. Hydra. Fury doing Fury things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s certainly a jam packed volume… but for all that happens, what has actually changed?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feels like they’re trying to reboot a reboot while holding together entirely too much damage they (the writers) have done to this version of the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall: it’s fine, but I’m not surprised that this line doesn’t last long. Being yet another Volume 1 doesn’t help. Onward!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: Cap is a terrible President. 😃&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Spider-Man by Brian Michael Bendis, Volume 4</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/30/ultimate-comics-spider-man-by-brian-michael-bendis-volume-4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/30/ultimate-comics-spider-man-by-brian-michael-bendis-volume-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Miles is new on the job—and already too many people know (or suspect that he’s Spider-Man).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-spider-man-4-textbundle-258b1c.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do like this Jameson.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, that list includes Venom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now we’ve got to deal with the tragic origin part of Spider-Man stories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Spider-Man by Brian Michael Bendis, Volume 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/29/ultimate-comics-spider-man-by-brian-michael-bendis-volume-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/29/ultimate-comics-spider-man-by-brian-michael-bendis-volume-3/</guid><description>Unless I misread something, this is included as 1/3 of Ultimate Comics: Divided We Fall, United We Stand, for the most part overlapping with that story: the fall and rise of America in this crazy Ultimate Universe.
But here, we also get a lot more of the story of Miles and Uncle Aaron. Which is a bit more violent and brutal (and quick) than in Into the Spider-Verse (I think? I might be misremembering), since he&amp;rsquo;s the main protagonist.</description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics: Divided We Fall, United We Stand</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/29/ultimate-comics-divided-we-fall-united-we-stand/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/29/ultimate-comics-divided-we-fall-united-we-stand/</guid><description>&lt;p>Things are … slightly more broken then I realized.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now we have TWO Spider-Men.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s another part of what became Into the Spider-Verse, with another Peter Parker getting shot across dimensions and meeting Miles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s good fun all around. I’m glad to see the two get a chance to meet. And I’m going to have to check out some main universe Spider-Man at some point!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I do wonder… what’s Fury going to do now that he knows about parallel realities… or apparently what Stark might do.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I feel like it’s just so much diverging, so many deaths… at some point it just doesn’t land any more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I suppose we’re building up to another big event, but at this point, I’m mostly waiting to see how it all ends.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Ultimates by Jonathan Hickman, Vol. 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/25/ultimate-comics-ultimates-by-jonathan-hickman-vol.-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/25/ultimate-comics-ultimates-by-jonathan-hickman-vol.-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-ultimates-2-textbundle-87e0ba.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well that escalated again’ly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given the number of sudden super powered threats, it’s not over surprising. But in a world reeling… I’m doubtful we’ll get the gravitas this deserves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot certainly happens, but I find it hard to be invested in any of it. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Dead Town</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/24/the-dead-town/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/24/the-dead-town/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it ends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A direct sequel to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/09/lost-souls/">Lost Souls&lt;/a>, we finish up with Victor (etc) and his nanomachine replacements out in Montana.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of cool seeing the rugged, individual, hyper-&amp;ldquo;American&amp;rdquo; characters fight back. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit much at times, but I enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a conclusion to even two books, let alone five&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s fine? It does tie up most of the threats. But on the other hand, it&amp;rsquo;s all build up and &amp;hellip; just ends. I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of that. And barely any of the monsters/big bads from the first three books come back&amp;hellip; Just Erika and Jocko. Of all the things to keep&amp;hellip; why Jocko?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth finishing once I&amp;rsquo;d come that far, but it really is the sort of series you could probably finish at the first book and not miss mutch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Witch's Heart</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/23/the-witchs-heart/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/23/the-witchs-heart/</guid><description>&lt;p>It seems no matter the culture, myths and legends get weird. Norse mythology is &lt;em>absolutely&lt;/em> no exception to that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this story, we have a novelization of the story of Angrboda. Wife of Loki. Mother of monsters. She&amp;rsquo;s been around a while (it&amp;rsquo;s mythology, even she doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how long) and she just wants to be left alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like seeing a slightly more &amp;lsquo;raw&amp;rsquo; Norse mythology, especially than you get from (for example) the Marvel universe(s).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a bonkers story. You never know what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen. Being built on myths, the world is flexible at best. Rules are made to be broken.

So mutants? Not in a great place after Magneto’s wave.
The ones that are left are on the run and there are more than a few factions teeing to hunt them down.
And as if that weren’t enough, add in the new forces in SEAR. And others.
Oh it’s a wonderful mess. Dark. But it has potential.

&lt;p>He’s been around this whole time… and only sort of in the spotlight. Which I suppose us par for the course for him.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I did not realize that he originally came from the Ultimates universe. So this is actually a new origin story!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pretty cool. It’s interesting seeing what made it into Into the Spider-Verse—and what didn’t.&lt;/p>

If you visit a world where another you is still alive, you die.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why have I survived? Because I am a creature more devious than all the other mes put together. Because I saw myself bleeding out and instead of checking for a pulse, I began collecting her things. I survive the desert like a coyote survives, like all tricksters do.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating premise, especially when you dig just a bit deeper: Who are the people most likely able to jump? Who&amp;rsquo;s the most likely to have died on other worlds?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a story about privilege. About a world built for the rich and powerful&amp;ndash;by those who have nothing or less; those that pay everything and get nothing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Cartography, at its heart, was about defining one&amp;rsquo;s place in the world by creating charts and measurements. Nell had lived her life by that idea, that everything could be mapped according to references and thereby understood. But she could see now that she had been paying attention to the wrong references.&lt;br>
It was not a map alone that made a place real.&lt;br>
It was the people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a tricky one to review. It&amp;rsquo;ll take some minor spoilers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell (if you want to completely avoid spoilers), it&amp;rsquo;s a decent book with a fascinating premise that could have done so much more for the actual execution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Spider-Man: Death of Spider-Man Fallout</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/14/ultimate-comics-spider-man-death-of-spider-man-fallout/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/14/ultimate-comics-spider-man-death-of-spider-man-fallout/</guid><description>&lt;p>I feel like we’ve &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/16/ultimatum-requiem/">been here before&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But this time around, as much as it is about endings… it’s also about new beginnings (see below, spoilers). Which is kind of a bummer. We really needed more time to breath and process, but this all feels like setting up whatever comes next.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Zeroes, not Heroes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That was fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s the story of six American teenagers who discover they have superpowers. And fairly atypical ones too. A Voice that says exactly what needs to be said&amp;ndash;for better or for worse. Being immediately forgotten. Crashing electronics all around you. Controlling mobs. Leadership (somehow different from mobs). Seeing through others&amp;rsquo; eyes.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Maybe Flicker&amp;rsquo;s power made her think differently than most people. She saw the world from so many perspectives, and seeing was half of enlightenment.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So. Is he finally going to hang up the mask for good? (again) A metaphorical sort of death?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or, given that it&amp;rsquo;s the Ultimate Marvel Universe&amp;hellip; is Peter Parker himself the next on chopping block?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of all the Ultimate Marvel titles, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/ultimate-spider-man/">Ultimate Spider-Man&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/ultimate-comics-spider-man-2009/">continued&lt;/a>) has been by far the most consistently good.

&lt;p>Pride can become arrogance. Arrogance is the father of cruelty. But in the beginning, there was also an idealism, a hope that he could change the human condition.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; fine. It&amp;rsquo;s got all the bits you&amp;rsquo;d need for a thriller, but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel the villains as much.

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Take the extremist end of the American Protestant religious right. Give them everything they want (plus some) over the span of years (if not months).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Men have taken absolute power. In a world with (dramatically) declining birth rates, women are owned by the state. Their bodies are nothing more than a vessel for their wombs. They can&amp;rsquo;t travel alone, can&amp;rsquo;t be seen, can&amp;rsquo;t own property.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like any good story of this sort, it takes a potential problem&amp;ndash;an idea&amp;ndash;and turns it up to eleven. It goes steps further than anything we&amp;rsquo;ve seen in modern times&amp;ndash;or at least differently. The closest analogue I&amp;rsquo;m aware of is probably the events around the Iranian Revolution in 1979. By 1981, hijab were mandatory (there&amp;rsquo;s more to the history there; even before, hijab were seen as a method of protest against Westernization). Given this book was released in 1985, it seems&amp;hellip; potentially related.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; terrifying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the more so, for all those men (often in positions of power) that even today see it less as a cautionary tale and more something to aspire to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Stories always begin the same way: There was and there was not. There is possibility in those words, the chance for hope or despair.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>On the other hand, we don&amp;rsquo;t actually get a number of those big moments. There is plenty of dragon conflict, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, but there&amp;rsquo;s also a lot missing.

&lt;p>Yes, I’m aware of the irony, given for example Gwen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s fun. Making up a team of sorts? Getting back to normalcy in a seriously screwed world?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like it. I hope we get more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a while at least. I can see the titles coming up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crucible of Gold</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/25/crucible-of-gold/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/25/crucible-of-gold/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“They are ours,” he said, “although not properly the sailors: they are only along because we would not leave them to drown, and ought to be more grateful for it than they are. Laurence,” he said, turning, “this is Palta, and that man is called Taruca: Iskierka snatched him, and I cannot find she asked him in the least.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s an interesting one. On one hand, I&amp;rsquo;m glad they&amp;rsquo;re out of Australia. Instead, they&amp;rsquo;re off across the Pacific&amp;hellip; to Brazil and the Portuguese royal family. Of course things don&amp;rsquo;t go as expected. Crossing the Pacific is one mess and meeting up with the Inca and how they deal with dragons was pretty fascinating&amp;ndash;they&amp;rsquo;re still a power to be reckoned with in this world, mostly on the backs of their local dragons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s still not up to the strengths of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/13/victory-of-eagles/">Victory of Eagles&lt;/a>, mostly because the travels and exploration was never the original draw of the series&amp;ndash;the Napoleon but &lt;em>dragons&lt;/em> was, and we&amp;rsquo;ve scant little of that. This time around&amp;hellip; we do at least get the war, which is pretty cool. So it&amp;rsquo;s a decent book.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
