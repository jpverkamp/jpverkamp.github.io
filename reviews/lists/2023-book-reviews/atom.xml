&lt;p>Heidi is just so innocent and fun. Her grandfather is the prototypical gruff old man with a heart of gold. Peter&amp;ndash;the Goat General&amp;ndash;is hilarious and a fun counter to the overwhelming wholesomeness. Clara you just want the best for&amp;ndash;and yay magical mountain air!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s not much in the way of plot, but that&amp;rsquo;s all right. You&amp;rsquo;re still going to get a chance to live vicariously through Heidi for a few hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s probably a lesson in there touching on ideas of homeschooling, parental rights, and living outdoors and off the land, but really, it&amp;rsquo;s more a matter of the times (written in 1880) than anything. Take it as you will.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth the read, especially if you have little ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Broken Soul</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/19/broken-soul/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/19/broken-soul/</guid><description>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s quite a book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first, it&amp;rsquo;s more of the same. Jane dealing with vampire politics and her own love life as things just keep getting a bit crazier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then we learn that the European vampires are coming to visit. And they might just want to poke their noses into various artifacts Jane has picked up through the books&amp;ndash;or that Leo has and Jane hasn&amp;rsquo;t realized yet&amp;hellip; Including another big piece of vampire history.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And &lt;em>then&lt;/em> we get a whole deeper look into the metaphysics of the Jane&amp;rsquo;s universe. Light dragons. More about what the Mercy Blade actually is. More about Soul. And perhaps&amp;ndash;more about how Jane&amp;rsquo;s own history and powers might fit in with all of it. It&amp;rsquo;s going quite a different direction than most Urban Fantasy I&amp;rsquo;ve read and I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated to see where this is going.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus, it&amp;rsquo;s a major upgrade for Jane&amp;rsquo;s powers&amp;ndash;which she may very well need to survive&amp;ndash;even if it comes at quite the cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like I said, it gets crazier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And on top of all &lt;em>that&lt;/em>, we actually get a bit of a straight forward&amp;ndash;well, relative to what&amp;rsquo;s come before&amp;ndash;relationship for Jane!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“For a reason or a season,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;ldquo;For a year or a lifetime. For a poem or a song. For a victorious battle or a bloody death. For honor. I would stand by you for as long as I might live.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s about time&amp;hellip; I hope the best for them, at least for a little while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a crazy book and worth the read if you&amp;rsquo;ve already made it this far. Even if (minor spoilers) &amp;hellip; we don&amp;rsquo;t actually even &lt;em>get&lt;/em> to the European vampires for the most part!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: Almost the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/11/25/broken-souls/">second book by that title&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fire Ice</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/18/fire-ice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/18/fire-ice/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another day (week?), another Cussler. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve read this one before, but that&amp;rsquo;s sort of the appeal of all of these books&amp;ndash;some quasihistorical inciting incident (that happens on or near the oceans) then jump to the present time to find the resulting shipwreck and deal with the secret organization (for example) that&amp;rsquo;s trying to RULE THE WORLD.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time with more Russia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have the daughters of Nikolai II, last Emperor of Russia&amp;ndash;on the run with all the royal jewels, including one very shiny crown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cut to the modern era, we have a Russian spy who&amp;rsquo;s gone toe to toe with Kurt Austin several times over the years, a manic trying to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/methane%20clathrate">blow up the ocean floor&lt;/a> and cause &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsunamis">tsunamis&lt;/a>, and gangs of modern neo-&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossacks">Cossacks&lt;/a> trying to bring back Mother Russia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s exactly what it says on the tin&amp;ndash;a &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/numa-files/">NUMA Files&lt;/a> novel&amp;ndash;and quite the adventure for all that. Formulaic, but a fun listen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars Vol. 3: Rebel Jail</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/11/star-wars-vol.-3-rebel-jail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/11/star-wars-vol.-3-rebel-jail/</guid><description>&lt;p>Backstory! Work Obi-Wan and Luke’s uncle. A prison hidden tucked right up against a sun. Hearding Nerfs. Sana, Leia, and Aphra… working together?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a decent enough adventure with quite the set pieces. I just wish I had more time in Obi-Wan’s backstory now!&lt;/p>

It’s a neat story, but out so I wish there were easier to read on Marvel Unlimited…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out Anakin can still fly…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-vader-down-textbundle-413633.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, Vader is forced down. One thing leads to another and the Rebellion decides that an entire battalion might be needed to keep him down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This may not be enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s nice to see Dr. Aphra again. Been a a bit. And oh the droids.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For as annoying as it is to switch from series to series, that’s quite an enjoyable story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title> Star Wars Vol. 2: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/04/star-wars-vol.-2-showdown-on-the-smugglers-moon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/04/star-wars-vol.-2-showdown-on-the-smugglers-moon/</guid><description>&lt;p>The continuing in between adventures of all our original trilogy friends!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a fun one, a dueling pair of adventures and a bit of backstory bridging the original trilogy and the prequels. I think that’d be an interesting era to read more about. How exactly did things go &lt;em>so badly&lt;/em> so quickly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blue Gold</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/03/blue-gold/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/03/blue-gold/</guid><description>In this century wars will not be fought over oil, as in the past, but over water. The situation is becoming desperate. The world&amp;rsquo;s water is strained by population growth. There is no more fresh water on earth than two thousand years ago when the population was three percent of its current size.
Oof.
Serpent started us down the road of an alternative to Dirk Pitt with the NUMA Files.</description></item><item><title>Star Wars Vol. 1: Skywalker Strikes</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/01/star-wars-vol.-1-skywalker-strikes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/01/star-wars-vol.-1-skywalker-strikes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s read another &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/marvel-star-wars/">Marvel Star Wars&lt;/a> series! This time, getting a bit away from Vadar, we have Star Wars (2015). Set (initially) right after A New Hope, we have the fallout of the (first) Death Star and the whole gang out on a variety of adventures!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a fun start. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing where they go from here!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Serpent</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/25/serpent/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/25/serpent/</guid><description>“Nereus, the Old Man of the Sea,” Nina murmured, cocking her head in thought. “There’s a quote from Hesiod, the Greek poet: ‘A trusty and gentle god who thinks just and kindly thoughts and never lies.”
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve read any Clive Cussler. Turns out there are even a few new Dirk Pitt books I&amp;rsquo;ll have to catch up on. But even then, I still haven&amp;rsquo;t actually read any of his second related series: The NUMA Files.</description></item><item><title>The Sunlit Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/23/the-sunlit-man/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/23/the-sunlit-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so ends the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/year-of-sanderson/">Year of Sanderson&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/19/tress-of-the-emerald-sea/">Tress&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/14/yumi-and-the-nightmare-painter/">Yumi&lt;/a> already hinted at new and interesting worlds in the far future of the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-cosmere/">The Cosmere&lt;/a>, but the connections were (relatively) small parts of the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Sunlit man is a bit more tied in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s still in the far future. And oh, the hints we get at where the Cosmere is going&amp;hellip; but this time, we have a protagonist we&amp;rsquo;ve met before, chock full of references to stories we&amp;rsquo;ve seen&amp;ndash;and a few that haven&amp;rsquo;t happened yet. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into who it is&amp;ndash;spoilers!&amp;ndash;but it&amp;rsquo;s a neat surprise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a solid story as all the Cosmere secret projects have been. I think I prefer Tress and Yumi over Sunlit Man, but it&amp;rsquo;s by absolutely no means a bad book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think my only real negative is&amp;hellip; I want more! More of protagonist. More of the Night Brigade. More of this weird offshoot society. More worldbuilding and magic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I&amp;rsquo;m worried we won&amp;rsquo;t see more/any of this for at the very least a very long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s still very worth the read.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit since we&amp;rsquo;ve seen Molly and the Trueblood family&amp;ndash;what with killing her sister gone evil and all. I missed them. The dynamic between Jane and Molly was interesting, as was the relationship between Molly and her husband Evan (from what relatively little we saw of it). And Angie is fascinating&amp;ndash;so much potential for crazy things to happen there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So when Evan almost literally blows into town, blaming Jane for Molly gone missing? Only for some of Katie&amp;rsquo;s girls gone missing as well. And a new (old) vampire from out of town come visiting. All at the same time?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, things are bound to get interesting&amp;ndash;all together perhaps my favorite book of the series thus far.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Last Star</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/17/the-last-star/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/17/the-last-star/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s always been this way&amp;hellip; We bear the unbearable. We endure the unendurable. We do what must be done until we ourselves are undone.
Whelp. That&amp;rsquo;s where The 5th Wave ends. Honestly, the first book was really quite good. The second was fine. And the third was &amp;hellip; marginally better?
But really, the ending kind of came out of left field, we got too much and not enough of the alien invaders all at the same time, and &amp;hellip; other than (mostly) Ringer, I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly care about what happens next to any of the protagonists.</description></item><item><title>Blood Trade</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/14/blood-trade/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/14/blood-trade/</guid><description>&lt;p>Onward in Jane&amp;rsquo;s ever increasing trials and tribulations in the world(s) of the VAMPIRES!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the upside, I really love Jane&amp;rsquo;s new found family in Eli and the Kid. It&amp;rsquo;s great to have someone close to her that she can rely on more directly than all the on again off again allies, potential lovers (as screwed up as many of those are), and other relationships she&amp;rsquo;s had through the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“And we don’t give a rat’s ass that you’re a skinwalker,” the Kid added. I heard the slap on the back of his head, and my smile went even wider. He’d braved a head slap to reassure me in that gutsy, bigmouthed way teenaged boys have. “As long as you don’t shift and get hungry enough to think about us as dinner. ’Cause, like, that would, like, totally suck.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>On another upside, it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to dig more into Jane&amp;rsquo;s more recent past. Not hundreds of years ago when she was born (still needing more of that), but her life as a child and a few into her badass (if lonely) way of dealing with all of that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worldbuildingwise, the Vampires continue to get more complicated. Bruiser is an Onario now? Whatever that is. Sounds neat. And whatever Soul actually is? More of that please! For whatever reason, I like injections of weird, unique things in urban fantasy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the downside, relationship drama. She &lt;em>really&lt;/em> needs to get over Rick. That&amp;rsquo;s not an option (for now). Just move on. Bruiser would be great. Leo (relationshipwise) is a whole heaping mess and I hope that&amp;rsquo;s not a serious option. Or any of the other men, really. Just&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s been six books. Move on already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a fun adventure and I really look forward to what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen next!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Origins of The Wheel of Time: The Legends and Mythologies that Inspired Robert Jordan</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/14/origins-of-the-wheel-of-time-the-legends-and-mythologies-that-inspired-robert-jordan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/14/origins-of-the-wheel-of-time-the-legends-and-mythologies-that-inspired-robert-jordan/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-wheel-of-time/">The Wheel of Time&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Robert Jordan built an absolutely wonderful world. And when he passed away, Brandon Sanderson (with the help of Jordan&amp;rsquo;s wife and team) managed to do what I really wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure was possible and managed to &lt;em>finish&lt;/em> it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Infinite Sea</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/14/the-infinite-sea/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/14/the-infinite-sea/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>That’s the cost. That’s the price. Get ready, because when you crush the humanity out of humans, you’re left with humans with no humanity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In other words, you get what you pay for&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/10/the-5th-wave/">The 5th Wave&lt;/a> had an interesting premise with a lot of potential: alien spaceship shows up; 4 waves of death and destruction kill 99.99% of humanity. This is the story of all that unfolding, plus what happens next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Infinite Sea takes that&amp;hellip; and continues it?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The 5th Wave</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/10/the-5th-wave/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/10/the-5th-wave/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>After the 1st wave, only darkness remains.&lt;br>
After the 2nd, only the lucky escape.&lt;br>
And after the 3rd, only the unlucky survive.&lt;br>
After the 4th wave, only one rule applies: trust no one.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the world (as we know it). The aliens came and killed off most of humanity&amp;ndash;in some actually fairly interesting ways. This is the story of what comes next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first, it&amp;rsquo;s the story of Cassie after the end of the world. How she survives each wave (not told in order), how things keep getting worse, and then finally how she starts to find some &lt;em>other&lt;/em> survivors.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“I would kill for a cheeseburger. Honestly. If I stumbled across someone eating a cheeseburger, I would kill them for it.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But then we start getting a few more points of view. More survivors and their own stories of death. Child soldiers. Human* survivors every bit as bad as the aliens. A possible look into what comes next.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How do you rid the Earth of humans? Rid the humans of their humanity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Abe Kalotay died in his front yard in late February, beneath a sky so pale it seemed infected. There was a wintery wet snowbite to the still air and the sprawled-open pages of the book at his side had grown slightly damp by the time his daughter Joanna came home and found his body lying in the grass by their long dirt driveway.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s quite the opening. Such beautiful language for something so dark. Which really sums up the book in a lot of ways.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thornhedge</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/28/thornhedge/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/28/thornhedge/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another day, another Kingfisher. And once again, I quite enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time, we have a novella length story that takes Rapunzel and turns it more than a bit sideways. As the blurb says:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a princess trapped in a tower. This isn&amp;rsquo;t her story.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Instead, we get Toadling. Raised by the fae with the power to turn into a frog and some other minor magics of her own, she ends up standing guard over a girl in a tower for years and years&amp;ndash;centuries really, it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely clear; nor does it particularly matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I quite enjoyed the different take on the story&amp;ndash;I do love a good fairy story. I enjoyed the character of Toadling. The idea of the bramble and a gift gone awry. Not a huge fan of the idea of straight up pure evil in general and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work any better here (spoilers I suppose?). But it&amp;rsquo;s a small enough part of the story that I don&amp;rsquo;t think it particularly detracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good book. A quick read. Worth it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rule of Wolves</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/27/rule-of-wolves/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/27/rule-of-wolves/</guid><description>&lt;p>I hate it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, not the book, I actually quite liked the book. It&amp;rsquo;s never an easy task to bring together as many different plotlines as you have when you&amp;rsquo;re the second book of the third series set in the same world&amp;ndash;and I think Bardugo did it well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, I hate that one particular death in this book. They did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> have to die.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which I suppose means that it worked? Except&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t really feel like it changed anything, other than to annoy me, the reader. So it goes I suppose.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 7: Unbound Force</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/26/darth-vader-vol.-7-unbound-force/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/26/darth-vader-vol.-7-unbound-force/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v7-textbundle-bfbe5d.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Walk softly and carry a big stick. Or stomp loudly and carry enough firepower to start a small war. Whatever worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so continues the saga of Jane Yellowrock (and Beast!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, there&amp;rsquo;s a vampire plague, a new (old) vampire making a play for territory, and Jane accidentally making promises she certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean to&amp;ndash;and perhaps starting a war for her troubles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a solid book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Lions of Al-Rassan</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/21/the-lions-of-al-rassan/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/21/the-lions-of-al-rassan/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It was a day that would be remembered all her life by Jehane bet Ishak, the physician, for reasons over and above those of her fellow citizens in that proud, notoriously rebellious town: she lost her urine flask in the afternoon, and a part of her heart forever before the moons had set. The flask, for reasons of family history, was not a trivial matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That is a dense book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have a land in turmoil, warring city states, religious fervor, and the potential (perhaps a bit more than that) of a looming holy war.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Time and steady governance would bring Jad back into Al-Rassan, the king had declared, not burnings and destruction. Ibero wasn’t entirely sure how that meshed with holy doctrine, but he kept silent in the N
presence of his betters.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You have a half dozen points of view, from a warrior poet to a general to a physician to a young boy and more.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I am increasingly unlikely to be best remembered, ibn Khairan decided ruefully, entering his home, for my poetry.&lt;/p>

We had our fun with Kaz and crew in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/">Six of Crows&lt;/a>. And now we shift focus once again, back to Ravka.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In some ways, it&amp;rsquo;s a continuation of the storyline of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a>, following the new King Nikolai as he deals with securing his throne in a nation deeply in debt with enemies on all sides. Plus, we get a lot more Zoya (who I did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> expect to like as much as I did) and at least some more of Genya and David (I do love their relationship).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another fascinating aspect of that storyline is that we get to dig much more into the mystical/religious underpinnings of the world. Six of Crows never really went there, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely something that came up in Shadow and Bone. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to feel like you know how magic works in the world&amp;ndash;and then realizing that you know nothing after all&amp;hellip; (both as a reader and as the characters).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will warn though: this part got &lt;em>weird&lt;/em>. All sorts of new and interesting (or I suppose old and interesting) metaphysics and magic we hadn&amp;rsquo;t really dug into before. A bit jarring&amp;ndash;both for the reader and for the characters involved&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a completely different direction, we also have a main storyline with Nina from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/">Six of Crows&lt;/a> (of all the characters, hers isn&amp;rsquo;t the first story I would have chosen to continue, but it is interesting). She&amp;rsquo;s still messed up / something new and now she&amp;rsquo;s off to Fjerda to continue to try to save the world. Newcomer Hanna is a lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a solid book. It&amp;rsquo;s weird how disjoint the two storylines are&amp;ndash;they don&amp;rsquo;t really interact at all, although I see how they&amp;rsquo;ll likely come together in [[todo:Rule of Wolves]]. I kept finding myself annoyed when we switch from one to another.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 5: The Shadow's Shadow</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/12/darth-vader-vol.-5-the-shadows-shadow/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/12/darth-vader-vol.-5-the-shadows-shadow/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sabe!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v5-textbundle-1f9451.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems the Handmaidens freed a number of former slaves from Tattooine. Including some familiar very minor characters from episode 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A great way to… blackmail Vader into doing a good thing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v5-textbundle-f081b2.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For all Vader touts order over chaos… he certainly does have a flair for shaking things up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also: an ‘artificial life force draining storm’ is so very Star Wars sounding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a fine story. Interesting to see the complexity Vader is struggling with even now/then.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 4: Crimson Reign</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/09/darth-vader-vol.-4-crimson-reign/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/09/darth-vader-vol.-4-crimson-reign/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v4-textbundle-6d8ec1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So forget Luke and Han Vader is apparently going after this Crimson Dawn now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v4-textbundle-99b49e.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They’re everywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Should be right up Vader’s alley.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add to that the return of Sabe. It’s an unexpectedly interesting way to tie into Vader’s past. One just had to wonder if/&lt;em>when&lt;/em> she’ll learn the truth of Vader’s identity…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still not quite as good as the first two volumes but an enjoyable read nevertheless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On thing I particularly enjoy about the comics is just how varied and alien the universe can feel:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v4-textbundle-5f40a5.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a nice contrast to how human centric the movies and shows have to be. Easier to draw a bug/lizard/ten foot ball droid than to put them on film.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 3: War of the Bounty Hunters</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/darth-vader-vol.-3-war-of-the-bounty-hunters/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/darth-vader-vol.-3-war-of-the-bounty-hunters/</guid><description>&lt;p>Vader is after Solo now…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v3-textbundle-a96877.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With some interesting “allies”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus an appearance by the one and only (I assume) IG-88!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Coolest part:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v3-textbundle-e568a4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vader getting &lt;del>hacked&lt;/del> sliced! He’s ‘more machine now than man’ so it fits. They could have done so much more with it…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The introduction (for me at least) of the Crimson Dawn is interesting as well. A Million Stronger than One. A neat idea to contrast the ‘only two there are’ Sith and the Big Damn Heroes of the Rebellion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit more out there than the previous two volumes but I enjoyed it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Raven Cursed</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/raven-cursed/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/raven-cursed/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>Jane is still up to here in Vampire politics&amp;ndash;with the complications of Witches and Weres for good measure. But at least now, she&amp;rsquo;s back home in North Carolina.

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v2-textbundle-a28ead.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Emperor was not thrilled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So he tears Vader apart over again, sends him back to Mustafar (planet of his both in a way), and forbids him the force.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things only get more epic from here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a whirlwind of Vader passing test after trial, showing off just why he’s one of the most powerful beings in the Galaxy. Until we return to Exegol—2 years after the Rise of Skywalker; trying to fill in some of the mess that one made of continuity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vader is a weird choice for a protagonist, but likewise weirdly compelling. He is (at this point) unabashedly evil, yet I find myself rooting for him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 1: Dark Heart of the Sith</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/05/darth-vader-vol.-1-dark-heart-of-the-sith/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/05/darth-vader-vol.-1-dark-heart-of-the-sith/</guid><description>&lt;p>Darth Vader, shortly after Luke escapes him in The Empire Strikes Back. Realizing that perhaps he doesn’t actually &lt;em>know&lt;/em> what happened to Padme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Off to trawl through the past. With… quite the droid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v1-textbundle-108da3.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a fascinating look into Vader forced to dig into Anakin’s past. On Tattoine. On—and under—Naboo. Work the Handmaidens and other from Padme’s life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fascinating mix. I’m curious where it goes next!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“Crows remember human faces. They remember the people who feed them, who are kind to them. And the people who wrong them too. They don’t forget. They tell each other who to look after and who to watch out for.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/">Six of Crows&lt;/a> took the world of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> and instead gave us one heck of a heist book. Really, it all circled around one big, impossible heist. Plan everything, get in, plans fall apart, make new plans, and pull off the impossible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s one heck of an impressive book and I really enjoyed it, but it left an awful lot of plot thread hanging open&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which makes Crooked Kingdom all the more cathartic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Six of Crows</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>No mourners.&lt;br>
No funerals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Among them, it passed for &amp;lsquo;good luck.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s such a good book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It takes the world of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> and completely ignores the at times overly YA political and religions machinations of that particular trilogy in favor of a somewhat darker and grittier heist novel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the most part, you really don&amp;rsquo;t need to have read Shadow and Bone first. There are a few references to the &amp;lsquo;Ravkan Civil War&amp;rsquo; and even to Sankta Alina, but other than that, it&amp;rsquo;s a new world. There are still Grisha, but they&amp;rsquo;re far less &amp;lsquo;miliary&amp;rsquo;, instead using (and hiding) their powers in all manner of interesting ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And while the heist elements were &lt;em>strong&lt;/em> (an impossible job, planning going absolutely sideways, and double triple crossing left and right) we also get all sorts of interesting backstory. Each of the main characters has chapters in their voice, but in the action going now, and explaining how they got into this mess in the first place. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot, but in a good way!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One gotcha is that, while the main heist plot is more than adequately contained in the book, it very much is the first half of a duology. It managed to just make me want to read the second&amp;hellip; but don&amp;rsquo;t go into this looking for a stand alone novel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what really shines are the characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dead Man Logan, Vol. 1: Sins of the Father</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/26/dead-man-logan-vol.-1-sins-of-the-father/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/26/dead-man-logan-vol.-1-sins-of-the-father/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so he has an expiration date:&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/05/betsy-tacy/">Betsy-Tacy&lt;/a>, but now with more Tib. A new girl moves in, they become instant best friends, hijinks ensue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once again, it&amp;rsquo;s a delightful book to read with my own little one. I enjoy seeing what messes the children get into. And although they do get in trouble from time to time, we&amp;rsquo;re reminded that &lt;em>it&amp;rsquo;s okay to be children&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: my absolute favorite story is when they decide to cook.

After &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> set the stage and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/19/siege-and-storm/">Siege and Storm&lt;/a> raised the stakes, Ruin and Rising really brings everything home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have the increasing religious fever of Alina as Saint&amp;ndash;whether or not that&amp;rsquo;s what she wants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have what&amp;rsquo;s left of Alina&amp;rsquo;s friends and allies trying desperately to hold off the ever more powerful&amp;ndash;and ever more unhinged&amp;ndash;Darkling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We finally get some real history, digging deeper into where the Darkling came from&amp;hellip; and perhaps how Alina fits into it all as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have more adventures; a desperate bid to find the third Amplifier that may well save the day&amp;ndash;or doom them all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally&amp;ndash;obvious seeing as it&amp;rsquo;s the final novel in the trilogy&amp;ndash;we have victory. But at what cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s by a decent margin my favorite of the three. A solid conclusion, in my opinion. Now I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the other series in the same world. Six of Crows especially to see where those threads in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/25/shadow-and-bone-season-1/">the show&lt;/a> came from and King of Scars for a &amp;lsquo;what comes next&amp;rsquo;.

&lt;p>When people say impossible, they usually mean improbable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> had quite the ending. The Darkling showing his true allegiance, death and destruction, Alina and Mal on the run&amp;hellip; So of course in Siege and Storm they get captured by pirates (&lt;em>cough&lt;/em> I mean &lt;em>privateers&lt;/em>), the Darkling shows up again, they go meet the royal family, the Darkling shows up again, and in the end&amp;hellip; things just keep ending up getting worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s really a solid step up from Shadow and Bone. It&amp;rsquo;s still got a YA core, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely edging on the darker end of it all&amp;ndash;which I really enjoy.

&lt;p>‡ are my favorites, ∿ I listened to the audiobook. Full reviews + all reviews for each author are linked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ &lt;strong>Sequel (HM: Book 3+)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/the-infinite/">The Infinite&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/ada-hoffmann/">Ada Hoffmann&lt;/a>. Sci-fi with post-singularity AI acting as gods and a touch of cosmic horror. Interesting discussions about neurodiversity. My favorite of the series and a solid conclusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Mundane Jobs (Not on Earth)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/12/phoenix-extravagant/">Phoenix Extravagant&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/yoon-ha-lee/">Yoon Ha Lee&lt;/a>. A parallel to the China/Japan conflicts of a century ago and the jobs and sacrifices normal people (esp. artists) have to make during times of war and occupation. Also, Arazi (the dragon on the cover) really sells the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>Published in the 00s (HM: (HM: Not top 30 on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/11mvwsa/rfantasy_top_novels_2023_results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this list&lt;/a>)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/21/throne-of-jade/">Throne of Jade&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/naomi-novik/">Naomi Novik&lt;/a>. What if the Napoleanic Wars, but with DRAGONS. This one now with more travel to China. It&amp;rsquo;s a neat concept and I like throughout the series how the idea is explored in a number of different cultures, although as the series goes on, it starts to wear a bit thin. Temeraire and Laurence (dragon and &amp;hellip; handler? it&amp;rsquo;s complicated) are really the soul of these books. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/temeraire/">Temeraire&lt;/a> is the first book in the series; but I&amp;rsquo;d previously read that years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ &lt;strong>Angels and Demons (HM: Protagonist)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/24/good-omens-the-nice-and-accurate-prophecies-of-agnes-nutter-witch/">Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/neil-gaiman/">Neil Gaiman&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/terry-pratchett/">Terry Pratchett&lt;/a>. A mix of the wonderful worldbuilding of Pratchett and Gaiman that builds on both their strengths to build a fun ride, political/religious in exactly that fun somewhat blasphemous irreverent sort of way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bottom of TBR&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/01/blindsight/">Blindsight&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/peter-watts/">Peter Watts&lt;/a>. Vampires. In Space. It&amp;rsquo;s such a bonkers idea that I want more of it. Plus you get a surprisingly solid scientific reasoning for a lot of Vampire myths, a discussion on AI and the Chinese Room argument, talk about multiple personalities. It&amp;rsquo;s dense and a bit chaotic and weird. I liked it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Horror (HM: Not King or Lovecraft)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/07/prodigal-son/">Prodigal Son&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/dean-koontz/">Dean Koontz&lt;/a>. What if Frankenstein survived into the modern era and tried to conquer the world Invasion of the Frankenbodysnatchers style. It&amp;rsquo;s a solid Dean Koontz book, which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t read in years now. The problem is that it tries to fit far too many threads into one story and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really work without the sequels (and only barely works with them). Another book dealing with autism, dealt with mostly well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ &lt;strong>Coastal or Island Setting (HM: Features Seafaring)&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/19/tress-of-the-emerald-sea/">Tress of the Emerald Sea&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/brandon-sanderson/">Brandon Sanderson&lt;/a>. The feel of Princess Bride told through through the narrative lense of Hoid (which won&amp;rsquo;t make the least bit of sense if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read much of Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s Cosmere I suppose). I&amp;rsquo;ve read and enjoyed just about all of Sanderson and he&amp;rsquo;s got 4 novels out this year, so of course I have to use one of them. It&amp;rsquo;s delightful, touching little story and probably worth a read even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the rest of Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s work, although the ending will be weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>Queernorm Setting (HM: Not Futuristic)&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/03/under-the-whispering-door/">Under the Whispering Door&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/t.j.-klune/">T.J. Klune&lt;/a>. So… what do you call a slice of life story when the protagonist dies at the end of the first chapter? Whatever you do, Under the Whispering Door is a delightful example thereof. Despite taking place within our world, I would say it&amp;rsquo;s Queernorm within the much reduced setting of the story (the tea house and this specific corner of the afterishlife).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Set in the Middle East (HM: By an author of Middle Eastern heritage)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/07/girl-serpent-thorn/">Girl, Serpent, Thorn&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/melissa-bashardoust/">Melissa Bashardoust&lt;/a>. Take Persian mythology and worldbuilding, more than a touch of fairy tale feel, a cursed princess, demons, div (what in a Euro-centric story would be probably be fae), a touch of romance, and the spark of revolution. It’s an interesting world, an interesting premise, and you really want everything to go right in the end. I like the variety of non-humans. They feel the same as dozens of stories I read before–and yet, being based on a different set of myths and legends, different. All at the same time. It’s fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Title with a Title (HM: Not Royalty)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/09/the-handmaids-tale/">The Handmaid&amp;#39;s Tale&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/margaret-atwood/">Margaret Atwood&lt;/a>. Take the extremist end of the American Protestant religious right. Give them everything they want (plus some) over the span of years (if not months). Like any good story of this sort, it takes a potential problem–an idea–and turns it up to eleven. It goes steps further than anything we’ve seen in modern times–or at least differently. And all the more telling when you feel people in today&amp;rsquo;s world taking it as inspiration rather than a cautionary tale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Superheroes (HM: Not DC or Marvel)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/12/zeroes/">Zeroes&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/scott-westerfield/">Scott Westerfield&lt;/a>. The story of six American teenagers who discover they have superpowers. What I like most perhaps was the entire idea of the title: “Zeroes, not Heroes”. They’re not superheroes. (oops, guess it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit after all). I also enjoyed how diverse the cast was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Magical Realism or Literary Fantasy (HM: Not from &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/4bhiua/proposed_magical_realism_recommendation_list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this list&lt;/a>)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/16/the-cartographers/">The Cartographers&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/peng-shepherd/">Peng Shepherd&lt;/a>. Plus side: I love the premise. Take the idea of phantom settlements / copyright traps. Now make it so that if you happen to have the right map–you can actually get to those phantom settlements. I may have to check out Paper Towns. Minus side: it takes forever to actually get to the magic of the book. You (as the reader) are sure there’s more to them than you’d think, either having read the blurb–or just being aware of the book’s genre. But for how magical a concept it is, we barely get anything to do with them until halfway through the book and even then we’re only touching the surface. I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s Magical Realism for you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>Multiverse and Alternate Realities (HM: Not through a literal door)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/18/the-space-between-worlds/">The Space Between Worlds&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/micaiah-johnson/">Micaiah Johnson&lt;/a>. Hopping between worlds–with one big caveat. If you visit a world where another you is still alive, you die. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating digging into the idea that the best world hoppers are those raised under circumstances where they &lt;em>should have died&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Myths and Retellings (HM: Not Greek or Roman)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/23/the-witchs-heart/">The Witch&amp;#39;s Heart&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/genevieve-gornichec/">Genevieve Gornichec&lt;/a>. It seems no matter the culture, myths and legends get weird. Norse mythology is absolutely no exception to that. In this story, we have a novelization of the story of Angrboda. Wife of Loki. Mother of monsters. She’s been around a while (it’s mythology, even she doesn’t know how long) and she just wants to be left alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>Set in Space (HM: Not from Earth)&lt;/strong> (replacing Book Bingo/Readalong): &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/house-of-suns/">House of Suns&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/alastair-reynolds/">Alastair Reynolds&lt;/a>. In House of Suns, we have the story of a small subset of humanity writ large. The speed of light is the ultimate limit. Planets are decades apart; the galaxy hundreds of thousands of years around. So how do you continue that oh so human drive for exploration and expansion? Well in House of Suns, you create a thousand clones. Imprint them all with your memories. And send them out into the universe. Set it up so that ever few decades/centuries/millenia, they meet up, share all they’ve been to. What other branches of humanity have risen–or fallen? What other miracles of technology have been discovered? Who’s fallen in love? Sci-fi at it&amp;rsquo;s finest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Druids (HM: Not Iron Druid)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/13/dreamers-pool/">Dreamer&amp;#39;s Pool&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/juliet-marillier/">Juliet Marillier&lt;/a>. Take a bit of magic/folklore in an oldentimes Ireland; add in a Fae bargain (with all the complications that ensues); combine with a prince and princess who’ve never met outside of letters–and seem entirely different in person; and finish it all off with fairy tale magic of Dreamer’s Pool. It&amp;rsquo;s got an interesting cast and a nice fairy tale sort of plot, if a bit incomplete feeling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Mythical Beasts (HM: Not dragons)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/18/the-last-unicorn/">The Last Unicorn&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/peter-s.-beagle/">Peter S. Beagle&lt;/a>. It’s one of those books that just feels like a fairy tale. An ageless story. A story passed down from long ago ages of myth and fantasy. Ages with heroes and villains and wizards and–you guessed it–unicorns. It’s beautifully written (for the most part; there are certainly parts that feel overdone), chock full of wonderfully fantastic descriptions and metaphors that just sort of stick around. I really enjoy the characters, especially the titular Last Unicorn&amp;ndash;they don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> human; which I appreciate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Featuring Robots (HM: Robot protagonist)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/lock-in/">Lock In&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/john-scalzi/">John Scalzi&lt;/a>. A near future Earth where a flu-like pandemic (Haden’s Syndrome) has caused locked-in syndrome in some small percent of the world’s population (a small percent of billions is still an awful lot of people). Those affected are completely paralyzed, unable to move, while still being fully aware and conscious. Luckily(ish) a massive global effort has figured out how to embed computer hardware in their brains so as to allow them to remotely pilot either robotic bodies (threeps) or (more rarely) other humans who’ve allowed them access. This of course is widely accepted by the rest of humanity and causes no issues whatsoever. It&amp;rsquo;s arguable if the human minds in robotic bodies (the threeps) counts for the square, but if Murderbot counts, I would think this does too? It&amp;rsquo;s their body (although that&amp;rsquo;s a decent plot point in itself).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Novella (HM: Not Tordotcom)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/26/six-gun-snow-white/">Six-Gun Snow White&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/catherynne-m.-valente/">Catherynne M. Valente&lt;/a>. Take (the vague outline) the story of Snow White. Make it a Western. Things get weird. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting premise and certainly an interesting writing style&amp;ndash;although not my favorite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>5 SFF Shorts (HM: An Anthology)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/30/stories-of-your-life-and-others/">Stories of Your Life and Others&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/ted-chiang/">Ted Chiang&lt;/a>. Story of Your Life became the film Arrival, which got me to read the book. The rest are also really good, including some really interesting alternate takes on religion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>YA (HM: Published in the last 5 years)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/04/a-wizards-guide-to-defensive-baking/">A Wizard&amp;#39;s Guide to Defensive Baking&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/t.-kingfisher/">T. Kingfisher&lt;/a>. A world with weirdly specialized sorts of wizards. You might be able to cast lightning bolts… or you might have the power to animate and converse with dead horses. Or you might even have magical powers over… bread! It’s such a delightful idea and Kingfisher manages to do all sorts of fun things with it. Some obvious (Mongo eat your gingerbread heart out), some less so (Bob the sourdough starter; so delightful). I need to read more Kingfisher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>POC Author (HM: Furturistic Sci/fi)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/06/rosewater/">Rosewater&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/tade-thompson/">Tade Thompson&lt;/a>. A fascinating premise. Take the world a half century in the future. Most things are the same, but there’s a bit more tech floating around, mostly. Introduce a massive alien organism that lands in London and ends up burrowing it’s way to Nigeria. From that alien blob, fill the atmosphere with alien microorganisms/cells that create their own xenosphere, enabling (among other things) psychic powers in some very small proportion of the population. Writ rather more gritty than I was expecting with a complicated structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Self/Indie published (HM: Fewer than 100 ratings)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/10/the-book-of-zog/">The Book of Zog&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/alec-hutson/">Alec Hutson&lt;/a>. Zogrusz is an Eldrich Horror, a being from beyond time and space. But… a nice one? That just wants to do the right thing? It&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly adorable with some interesting cosmic level universebuilding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Elemental Magic (HM: Not Shades of Magic or Codex Alera)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/leigh-bardugo/">Leigh Bardugo&lt;/a>. Rather YA and the TV show is better (partially because it pulls from the other series in the same world as well). But I did enjoy the Russian influenced worldbuilding and the slightly more flexible than many YA contemporaries groupings. Has a lot of potential for the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Published in 2023 (HM: Debut)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/14/the-scourge-between-stars/">The Scourge Between Stars&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/ness-brown/">Ness Brown&lt;/a>. A generation ship with something going bump in the night? Isn&amp;rsquo;t it always night in space? In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s nicely terrifying if rather short (at novella length). Feels &lt;em>very&lt;/em> similar to Alien, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a bad thing. A solid debut.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(I originally read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/29/venco/">VenCo&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/cherie-dimaline/">Cherie Dimaline&lt;/a> for this spot, but realized as I was writing this post that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit hard mode.)&lt;/p>

To get us out of it, we sent a generation ship to the stars. But when we got there&amp;hellip; it wasn&amp;rsquo;t any better, so they turned around to go home. On the way back&amp;hellip; well, we just might not be alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A generation ship is a great setting for a sci-fi/horror mashup. There really is nowhere to run but plenty of places to hide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea of things lurking out there between the stars? Terrifying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The feel of the book, especially as it ratchets up to the big reveal/fight scenes throughout the ship? Excellent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the only real problems I had with the book were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It was too short! Novella length, but the premise alone could certainly fill a novel.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The technology was a bit odd at times (what exactly are they doing with &amp;lsquo;jumps&amp;rsquo;?)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;span class="spoiler">The things in the dark between stars not actually being the monster? Awesome. But... what were they then?&lt;/span>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Worth a read though! A debut author worth following.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Yumi and the Nightmare Painter</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/14/yumi-and-the-nightmare-painter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/14/yumi-and-the-nightmare-painter/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh Sanderson. How &lt;em>do&lt;/em> you do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three of the four novels in the &amp;ldquo;Year of Sanderson&amp;rdquo;. Tress was amazing and if anything&amp;hellip; Yumi is even better. (Frugal Wizard was fine. 😄)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shadow and Bone</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/</guid><description>&lt;p>Browsing through Netflix last fall, I came upon &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/25/shadow-and-bone-season-1/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a>. Watched it. Quite enjoyed it. Figured I should read the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s not bad, but I enjoyed the show more. For one, it pulls in Kaz and co, which don&amp;rsquo;t appear in this novel at all (they&amp;rsquo;re originally from the related Six of Crows books), which is a bummer. For two, the additional dynamic of Alina as half-Shu in addition to being an orphan added rather a lot to her character.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Book of Zog</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/10/the-book-of-zog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/10/the-book-of-zog/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The man scowled, but Zogrusz sensed a slight softening in his mood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I understand, stranger. I remember my first time in this room, when I felt His presence looming over me. But you cannot so blithely stroke the visage of our dread lord! Such disrespect might summon His wrath, and all of Xochintl would suffer.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“What delightful nonsense!” Zogrusz exclaimed, clapping his hands together. “Did you make it up yourself?”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Zogrusz is an Eldrich Horror, a being from beyond time and space. But&amp;hellip; a nice one? That just wants to do the right thing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book follows Zog and the quasi-Earth (it&amp;rsquo;s never entirely clear) he settles on through thousands of years (mostly with large time jumps) and the rise and fall of various religions up to (and through) and approaching cosmic horror style end of the world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mercy Blade</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/09/mercy-blade/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/09/mercy-blade/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty of chances in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/18/skinwalker/">Skinwalker&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/27/blood-cross/">Blood Cross&lt;/a> to get used to the Vampires, Witches, and &amp;hellip; well Jane and Beast of the world. We&amp;rsquo;ve even barely started to scratch the surface for how Vampires work and how they came to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So of course things have to get &lt;em>complicated&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 9: The Hunter and the Hunted</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/07/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-9-the-hunter-and-the-hunted/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/07/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-9-the-hunter-and-the-hunted/</guid><description>&lt;p>The hand returns…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-9-textbundle-31ffad.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, not that Hand. Logan’s hand. The one with the adamantium claws. I’ve actually enjoyed seeing him with the mismatched claws for a few volumes now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bit of a bummer, other than that. More spinning wheels with nowhere to go for Old Man Logan.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rosewater</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/06/rosewater/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/06/rosewater/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The idea of a singular hero and a manifest destiny just makes us lazy. There is no destiny. There is choice, there is action, and any other narrative perpetuates a myth that someone else out there will fix our problems with a magic sword and a blessing from the gods.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Rosewater has a fascinating premise. Take the world a half century in the future. Most things are the same, but there&amp;rsquo;s a bit more tech floating around, mostly. Introduce a massive alien organism that lands in London and ends up burrowing it&amp;rsquo;s way to Nigeria. From that alien blob, fill the atmosphere with alien microorganisms/cells that create their own xenosphere, enabling (among other things) psychic powers in some very small proportion of the population.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 8: To Kill For</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/05/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-8-to-kill-for/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/05/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-8-to-kill-for/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-8-textbundle-093e2f.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First half: Kingpin has gone all respectable! On the surface. Again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s impressive that keeps working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bullseye is a weird character. Logan’s eye is not healing. And that’s about it&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second half: An Old Geezer and some Z-list X-Men defend the school from… dating site scams?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cute. But also nothing special.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/04/a-wizards-guide-to-defensive-baking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/04/a-wizards-guide-to-defensive-baking/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“It is nearly impossibly to be sad when eating a blueberry muffin. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that&amp;rsquo;s a scientific fact.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I need to read more &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/t.-kingfisher/">T. Kingfisher&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/01/nettle-bone/">Nettle &amp;amp; Bone&lt;/a> was delightful and, if anything, A Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Defensive Baking is even better!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, we have a world with a specialized sorts of wizards. You might be able to cast lightning bolts&amp;hellip; or you might have the power to animate and converse with dead horses. Or you &lt;em>might&lt;/em> even have magical powers over&amp;hellip; bread!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>That’s a hot mess of a story—although some of that is probably not really having the background for who a lot of these people are. So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was nice actually (sort of) seeing Logan deal with the slower healing factor. I feel like though most of this we’ve heard of it, but no real problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fun enough read. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stories of Your Life and Others</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/30/stories-of-your-life-and-others/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/30/stories-of-your-life-and-others/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that was a delightful collection of shorts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t often read anthologies, but perhaps I should read more. I do love me some epic fantasy (I&amp;rsquo;ve read the entire &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-wheel-of-time/">The Wheel of Time&lt;/a> half a dozen times now&amp;hellip;), but there&amp;rsquo;s just something about a story that builds up quickly, gets to the point, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t stick around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think of the 8, I only bounced off 1 (which was actually a fine story, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t suspend disbelief enough for the premise) and 1 was a bit meh, just for how short it was. 6 of 8 I absolutely loved though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Absolutely worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
