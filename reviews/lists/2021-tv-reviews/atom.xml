      <title>The Good Place: Season 4</title>

      <description>The Good Place is an absolute gem of a show. It&amp;rsquo;s hilarious, it&amp;rsquo;s touching, and it even manages to make you think.
I watched the first three seasons a year or more ago, before the 4th season was out (let alone on Netflix), so it&amp;rsquo;s a bit out of order, but from the beginning or jumping in on season 4, it&amp;rsquo;s a show well worth watching.
In a nutshell, the main characters die and end up in the afterlife: The Good Place.</description>

      <description>Whoo boy. And so it ends. It&amp;rsquo;s a different sort of excellent from the peak of early SG-1, but the new team is really gelling, the Ori are a decent new threat, and it&amp;rsquo;s quite a ride to go out on. Not all shows end so well. I&amp;rsquo;m happy with this.
Excellent episodes: The Pegasus Project, crossover with Atlantis! 200, the best parody episode ever. The Quest: Part 1/2, a big team up with SG-1, Ba&amp;rsquo;al, and even eventually Adria, off to find a magic dodad&amp;ndash;plus, a dragon!</description>

      <description>And now we&amp;rsquo;re really getting into the cast shake ups. Richard Dean Anderson has mostly moved on and the powers that be have finally realized the team needs a new lead: So we get Ben Browder as Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have minded Carter keeping the reigns and Bowder certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t Anderson, but unlike the whole Jonas mess, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to be. He&amp;rsquo;s still a fairly straight laced military leader, but he&amp;rsquo;s his own kind and I really like it.</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanda Maximoff: We are an unusual couple, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vision: Oh, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that was ever in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well. That was most certainly a thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A TV show about chess set in the 1960s? How good could that even be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out: very very good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Things are getting shaken up yet again. O&amp;rsquo;Neill is the big boss now and isn&amp;rsquo;t going on missions any more, leaving SG-1 down a member. Dr. Weir has a new face (Torri Higginson); who will continue the role in Atlantis is kind of weird, but knowing already how well she did there, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see it any other way. Anubis is gone for the moment and the Goa&amp;rsquo;uld are in disarray.</description>

      <description>Daniel Jackson is back! (they could have done rather a bit more with re-integrating him I think)
The beginning of the search for Atlantis! (it&amp;rsquo;s amusing, if a bit annoying how long that takes)
Stronger episodes: Lifeboat (Michael Shanks can really act; the plot is weird and weak but the acting is pretty dang impressive), Heroes (Oy. Just Oy. It&amp;rsquo;s a slow burn, but very very good), *Lost City( (woo the beginning of Atlantis!</description>

      <description>The first big shake up of the main SG-1 cast. For better or for worse (or for out of universe negotiating reasons), Daniel Jackson is no longer part of SG-1 (or, truly, this mortal plane), so instead we have Jonas: who&amp;rsquo;s basically a carbon copy of Daniel Jackson, but without all the history. I think he aboslutely did a great job&amp;ndash;and props to Corin Nemec for pulling that off&amp;ndash;but I really wish that they could have done something a little more different since they were already shaking things up.</description>

      <title>Stargate SG-1: Season 5</title>
      <link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/22/stargate-sg-1-season-5/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/22/stargate-sg-1-season-5/</guid>
      <description>Great episodes: 2001 (echoes of 2010 from last season), Wormhole X-Treme! (the parody episode to end all parody episodes), Summit/Last Stand (Goa&amp;rsquo;uld politics! A new bigger bad?!)
Less great episodes: Threshold (Jaffa weirdness and Teal&amp;rsquo;c defection didn&amp;rsquo;t last nearly long enough), Beast of Burden (we did this already)
Towards the end, we do get one interesting bit of shake up with the death of Daniel Jackson. Of course it&#39;s not the first time , but I imagine that for anyone watching this in real time, that was quite the shake up.</description>

      <description>Another great seasons.
Good episodes: Small Victories (Replicators!), Upgrades (SG-1 on PCP!), Divide and Conquer (oh O&amp;rsquo;Neill and Carter&amp;hellip;), and 2010 (time travel!)
Not as great: Crossroads (Jaffa episodes) and Entity (we&amp;rsquo;ve done this before).
The Best of the Best: Window of Opportunity. Groundhog Day done Stargate style. It&amp;rsquo;s absolutely wonderful and the only episode I&amp;rsquo;ll just randomly watch out of order.
Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a fairly middling seasons. It&amp;rsquo;s still a great show, but (other than Window of Opportunity), a general derth amazing.</description>
