Good times. Good times.
Also: Tell me there’s a series about Johanna Constantine. That’s quite the story of hers at the end of the volume.
The Passage Oh my. Constantine? But laughing?
The Laughing Magician Sounds pretty Constantine.
That’s been a while…
Another enemy left behind.

He cannot stop a Carrion Crow woman from dressing to honor the crow god, particularly on a day as sacred as today.</description></item><item><title>The Changeling</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/26/the-changeling/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/26/the-changeling/</guid><description>On one level, it&amp;rsquo;s about fatherhood. Apollo grew up without a dad and vows he&amp;rsquo;s going to do better by his own son. And right from the beginning&amp;ndash;a surprise delivery no one around was quite ready for&amp;ndash;he does everything he can. As a father, with my youngest about the age of Apollo&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; when things go sideways. But we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that.
On another level, it&amp;rsquo;s about motherhood. Emma had all sorts of issues of her own, but she and Apollo seem absolutely delightful together.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 20: Systems of Control</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/25/hellblazer-vol.-20-systems-of-control/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/25/hellblazer-vol.-20-systems-of-control/</guid><description>Constantine gets his Mojo back.
Joyride is a pretty crazy story which may yet come back to haunt us. All His Engines is even better, getting some Aztec flair in line. A good volume.
In The Deep End Quite a way to execute someone.
Wheels of Change, Systems of Control He’s back? Oh Constantine.
Ooh Constantine. Quite the work of art.
Joyride Magic? Or something more run of the mill—drugs?</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 19: The Red Right Hand</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/21/hellblazer-vol.-19-the-red-right-hand/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/21/hellblazer-vol.-19-the-red-right-hand/</guid><description>Well that’s an interesting saga. Heaven, Hell, and… a Third Place. Mythology certainly goes some interesting places in Hellblazer. I enjoyed it.
Empathy is the Enemy Confident. Can’t say it isn’t deserved though.
Not something monks want to hear I expect.
IRL the team seems attached to a particular brand of Fundamentalist Christians. I like this idea better.
The Season of the Zealot Map!
The Red Right Hand How do you fix something like that?</description></item><item><title>Physics of the Impossible</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/21/physics-of-the-impossible/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/21/physics-of-the-impossible/</guid><description>Physics of the Impossible is a really great book. It goes into a wide variety of primarily science fictional topics in decreasingly order of likelihood and gets into how each works (so far as they do work with what we know now) and what it would take to make them possible. There&amp;rsquo;s just enough scientific background that I understood most of it and could stretch for the rest, with pointers for what to search for to learn more, which is always a good way to go.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 18: The Gift</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/15/hellblazer-vol.-18-the-gift/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/15/hellblazer-vol.-18-the-gift/</guid><description>All about that little issue of Constantine and one very very long day.
There’s a lot of crazy things going on better my here. Quiet a story… where can it possibly go next?
Reasons to be Cheerful Twisted. Of course this would come back sooner rather than later.
Wonder who they got that from…
Cross Purpose New art, the fallout for Chas, and family troubles. Oh this story.</description></item><item><title>Nate the Great Stalks Stupidweed</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/15/nate-the-great-stalks-stupidweed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/15/nate-the-great-stalks-stupidweed/</guid><description>My oldest started reading not that long ago and oh how they&amp;rsquo;ve taken it to heart. Immediately into just about everything they can get their hands on. One of which?
Nate the Great!
They vary a bit in quality, but &amp;lsquo;Stalks Stupidweed&amp;rsquo; is pretty high up there in my opinion. It&amp;rsquo;s cute and has a few laugh out loud moments. Worth a try (especially if you&amp;rsquo;ve read the first 8).</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 17: Out of Season</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/14/hellblazer-vol.-17-out-of-season/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/14/hellblazer-vol.-17-out-of-season/</guid><description>Constantine lost and found and so very screwed. Literally. A lot happens in this one and there’s a lot of potential for what comes next. Looking forward to it.
Staring at the Wall The continuing story of the Shadow Dog and the Red Sepulchre.
Good times.
Cool detail.
And an excellent sense of scale.
It got worse! Uberpowerful beings bound by their own rules, always a good one.</description></item><item><title>Black Rain and Paper Cranes</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/10/black-rain-and-paper-cranes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/10/black-rain-and-paper-cranes/</guid><description>That&amp;rsquo;s a strange book. It&amp;rsquo;s one part historical novel&amp;ndash;detailing the development, usage, and aftermath of the nuclear weapons detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II&amp;ndash;one part technical manual&amp;ndash;very roughly detailing the physics and engineering behind early nuclear weapons&amp;ndash;and one part children&amp;rsquo;s book&amp;ndash;many scenes involve Fritz, the talking (and super fast) dove. We&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that.
Historically, it&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating and terrible story. So many brilliant scientists, engineers, and support staff&amp;ndash;all to make a weapon capable of destroying a city and killing tens/hundreds of thousands in moments.</description></item><item><title>The Poppy War</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/08/the-poppy-war/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/08/the-poppy-war/</guid><description>War doesn&amp;rsquo;t determine who&amp;rsquo;s right. War determines who remains.
That&amp;hellip; is quite a book.
Plotwise, for the first third or so, it&amp;rsquo;s a very solid &amp;lsquo;poor girl works very hard and gets into a prestigious (military) school&amp;rsquo;. Once there, she&amp;rsquo;s outcast and has to fight (literally) for her place. On top of that, she bumps into the mysterious &amp;lsquo;Lore&amp;rsquo; master who everyone thinks is nuts&amp;ndash;but just might know a bit about the magic no one believes in any more.</description></item><item><title>Daemon Voices</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/07/daemon-voices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/07/daemon-voices/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>He is interested in the discoveries of science (“intellectual daring and imaginative brilliance without parallel”), the freedoms of democracy (in particular “the great democracy of reading and writing”), the evils of authoritarianism (“always reductive whether it’s in power or not”) and the pitfalls of education (“any education that neglects the experience of delight will be a dry and tasteless diet with no nourishment in it”). He is profoundly interested in religion, while remaining puzzled by aspects of it. “The first thing to say about the Bishop’s arguments in his book,” he writes in “God and Dust,” “is that I agree with every word of them, except the words I don’t understand; and that the words I don’t understand are those such as spirit, spiritual and God.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Philip Pullman is an interesting author, which makes Daemon Voices an interesting sort of book. In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s a selected collection of essays and presentation he&amp;rsquo;s given over the years on a wide range of topics. In particular, he talks a lot about Paradise Lost (makes me want to actually read it), his religious and philosophical views (and a dive into Gnosticism) and how those interact with his writing, and a bit on writing advice and his own particular style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating look and there&amp;rsquo;s a little for everyone, so if you like what Pullman has written, you can certainly do worse than give it a chance!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are a few interesting quotes that I highlighted for just about every essay. It&amp;rsquo;s not really the sort of book where one should worry about spoilers, but just in case that&amp;rsquo;s not a shared option, you have been warned. (Also: &lt;em>long&lt;/em>)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 16: The Wild Card</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/05/hellblazer-vol.-16-the-wild-card/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/05/hellblazer-vol.-16-the-wild-card/</guid><description>A crazy bloody mess with some old friends in the longer stories and a few neat bits in the short ones. But more of Angela and Gemma.
A rather solid volume.
Thoughts as I read (spoilers):
High on Life Constantine with brown hair?! (Might be red) What’s this?
Bit of an ass.
Using his blood to heal/as a pick me up is quite the trick.
That’s a neat trick…</description></item><item><title>The Last Uncharted Sky</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/28/the-last-uncharted-sky/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/28/the-last-uncharted-sky/</guid><description>Where An Alchemy of Masques and Mirrors was mystery and religious fiddling and A Labyrinth of Scions and Sorcery was a political story, culminating in a fall of power (or at least a shift), The Last Uncharted Sky shifts yet again. This time we have a (aero)nautical adventure with skyships, pirates, lost treasures, and found families. Really, it&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful exploration of just how wonderful and strange the world we&amp;rsquo;ve been allowed to inhabit for just a little while.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 15: Highwater</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/13/hellblazer-vol.-15-highwater/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/13/hellblazer-vol.-15-highwater/</guid><description>It’s… fine? I enjoyed the first two longer stories well enough but the latter one was all kinds of weird. And not in a way I cared for?
Onward! Maybe to something new?
Individual thoughts (spoilers):
Lapdogs and Englishmen That’s what I was looking for. Great art style, interesting story. Bit of magic (ish), bits of fate.
Oh Constantine. It fits though. 5
And then suddenly young punk Constantine.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 14: Good Intentions</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/11/hellblazer-vol.-14-good-intentions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/11/hellblazer-vol.-14-good-intentions/</guid><description>That’s a few hard hitting stories. Hard Times is about Constantine in prison. Weird art style and hard to read. Good Intentions is the aftermath… people are terrible. Freezes Over it’s a pretty good locked room mystery with just the possibility of something more.
Overall, good but not the best Constantine. Needs more out and out unambiguous supernatural IMO.
Onwards!

Hard Time (Parts 1-5) Been a while.

I&amp;rsquo;ve long been interested in alife, artificial evolution, simulated creatures, etc, and have been looking to add back in more non-fiction so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d go ahead and give it a whirl.
Overal though, it seems&amp;hellip; rather lackluster. I guess if you&amp;rsquo;re just getting into the field, it&amp;rsquo;s a good summary of what all is involved, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get more than a page into detail about absolutely anything.</description></item><item><title>A Labyrinth of Scions and Sorcery</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/04/a-labyrinth-of-scions-and-sorcery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/04/a-labyrinth-of-scions-and-sorcery/</guid><description>An Alchemy of Masques and Mirrors was a delightful surprise of a book, with unique/excellent worldbuilding, fun characters, great wordsmithing, and a solid mystery of a plot. A Labyrinth of Scions and Sorcery has all three once again, although we mostly lose the mystery of the of first book and get a bunch of politics instead. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, it&amp;rsquo;s still great, it just took me a bit to get into the tonal shift.</description></item><item><title>The Wyrmling Horde</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/04/the-wyrmling-horde/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/04/the-wyrmling-horde/</guid><description>I think that for the most part The Wyrmling Horde takes everything I mentioned in Worldbinder and does a bit more of that. There are some really fascinating worldbuilding ideas being explored here, although I miss the smaller scope of just the Endowments and possibly the wizards of the early books. The characters are cool&amp;ndash;and I do actually find the inversions of several of them fascinating&amp;ndash;but we&amp;rsquo;re also missing a few faces that I really wish we would see more of.</description></item><item><title>Brothers of War The Iron Brigade at Gettysburg</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/03/brothers-of-war-the-iron-brigade-at-gettysburg/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/03/brothers-of-war-the-iron-brigade-at-gettysburg/</guid><description>“But at a great cost,” Williams continued, looking at the men and pointing in the direction where the Nineteenth suffered so horrendously. “The cost will be felt in hundreds of homes, factories, and farms back in Indiana…not only now, but for generations.

Mini-reviews and pretty pictures (spoilers):
Haunted That’s a story. Enough time to breathe, a cast of new and interesting story, and all sorts of gross and creepy scenes.
Part One Oy. Although you can’t say she’s wrong.
Murder scene description: oy that’s graphic.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 12: How to Play with Fire</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/07/hellblazer-vol.-12-how-to-play-with-fire/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/07/hellblazer-vol.-12-how-to-play-with-fire/</guid><description>Three multiple parters? No single issues? Sweet. Up the Down Staircase want my favorite, but both How to Play with Fire and Son of Man were excellent.
Mini reviews, pretty (horrifying) pictures and spoilers:
Up the Down Staircase Memes? I feel like I missed something. Interesting character development, but no real pay off.
Part One You are dating the wrong man.
Other than that, we have a fairly standard meet the family type scene.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 11: Last Man Standing</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/03/hellblazer-vol.-11-last-man-standing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/03/hellblazer-vol.-11-last-man-standing/</guid><description>A solid one. Big stories are interesting, little ones are touching_weird_sweet, and Constantine’s got some new people and problems to deal with. Nothing too surreal either, which I appreciate.
Mini-reviews (spoilers):
Days of Wine and Roses A little bit of Constantine, a little bit of regular human terror.
The Wild Hunt Oh my.
Also: Colts!
Last Man Standing Argue and his men as ancient immortals?

Not a standout volume, but still pretty good.
Mini reviews (spoilers):
The Nature of the Beast Sure…
Reading the future is a common enough trope in this genre, but I enjoyed it.
Walking the Dog Another ghost story&amp;hellip;
