At times, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s going on, which makes me feel bad for the characters. :D It&amp;rsquo;s still a wonderful fever top of a story though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Starless Sea</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-starless-sea/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-starless-sea/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Far beneath the surface of the earth, hidden from the sun and the moon, upon the shores of the Starless Sea, there is a labyrinthine collection of tunnels and rooms filled with stories. Stories written in books and sealed in jars and painted on walls. Odes inscribed onto skin and pressed into rose petals. Tales laid in tiles upon the floors, bits of plot worn away by passing feet. Legends carved in crystal and hung from chandeliers. Stories catalogued and cared for and revered. Old stories preserved while new stories spring up around them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The Starless Sea&lt;/em> is an unfortunate sort of book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, the prose is beautiful. There are some really wonderful passages and smaller stories that really sing on the pages. On top of that, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of delightful visuals described from the book. Often times, I don&amp;rsquo;t really picture what&amp;rsquo;s going on in a lot of stories, I more&amp;hellip; absorb them. But this, this really needs and thrives on the visuals. Especially leaning on the sights and smells of books and libraries and doors, it&amp;rsquo;s the sort of book a physical book lover (not a lover of stories, one of the actual physical books themselves) could really get into.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand&amp;hellip; even after reading through the entire book, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what in the world was going on / what the point of anything was. A book doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to have a point&amp;ndash;I do love a good slice of life story&amp;ndash;but this felt like it was trying to go for something. But with the absolute pile of characters (major, minor, versions of the same) jumping around all the time, it was hard to figure anything out. The prose and settings almost do enough to overcome that&amp;hellip; but not quite enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s a book that was almost really really good&amp;hellip; but didn&amp;rsquo;t quite stick the landing for me. It&amp;rsquo;s probably worth a try, but if you bounce off the first few chapters, consider that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really change that much before the end.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 6: Tommy Taylor and the War of Words</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-unwritten-vol.-6-tommy-taylor-and-the-war-of-words/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-unwritten-vol.-6-tommy-taylor-and-the-war-of-words/</guid><description>&lt;p>The story is going now. Tommy has leaned into his powers&amp;ndash;and his opponents are figuring out how to fight back!&amp;ndash;we learn who/what exactly Pullman is, and Savoy really gets to do his Vampire thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 5: On to Genesis</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/02/the-unwritten-vol.-5-on-to-genesis/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/02/the-unwritten-vol.-5-on-to-genesis/</guid><description>&lt;p>Finding stories, history, &amp;hellip; family?

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s good, if a bit convoluted at times.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Soul Taken</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/05/soul-taken/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/05/soul-taken/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This frail cloth, a gift to the person he had once been, was his touchstone, a reminder that once he had been whole. Once there had been joy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a crazy book for backstory. We get more backstory of Wulfe and Sherwood (big answers there), a bit more about Zee (he&amp;rsquo;s terrifying, but still a good guy), and even more escalations / variations on what it means that Mercy&amp;rsquo;s Coyote-magic is based around boundaries and death. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting variation, a complicated book, and well worth reading.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Bone Ships</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/03/the-bone-ships/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/03/the-bone-ships/</guid><description>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating bit of worldbuilding. In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s a world (or at least story) dominated by naval superiority&amp;ndash;brought about by ships built on the literal bones of sea dragons. And what&amp;rsquo;s more, the sea dragons appear to have been hunted to extinction, making the warships all the more rare and valuable.
It&amp;rsquo;s a very cool root for the story and Barker only takes it from there with unique twists on vocab and word choice, a few other interesting bits of magic, and more naval everything than you can shake some paint at.</description></item><item><title>A Canticle for Leibowitz</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/31/a-canticle-for-leibowitz/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/31/a-canticle-for-leibowitz/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But neither infinite power nor infinite wisdom could bestow godhood upon men. For that there would have to be infinite love as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That was an interesting book. In a nutshell, humanity finally managed to blow ourselves up&amp;ndash;and then the story begins. Years after Armageddon, we pick up with a religious order founded to preserve knowledge (a worthwhile goal).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Warning: the rest of this summary contains minor (IMO) spoilers on the structure of the book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 4: Leviathan</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/29/the-unwritten-vol.-4-leviathan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/29/the-unwritten-vol.-4-leviathan/</guid><description>&lt;p>Onward marches the story, ever stranger. Hints of what Tommy can (and must) do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onwards and upwards!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shorts - Shifting Shadows</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/13/shorts-shifting-shadows/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/13/shorts-shifting-shadows/</guid><description>&lt;p>With book #13 of the Mercy Thompson series (&lt;em>Soul Taken&lt;/em>) coming out later this month, I&amp;rsquo;ve been relistening to the rest of the series (and I&amp;rsquo;ll probably hit the &lt;em>Alpha &amp;amp; Omega&lt;/em> series on my way). Between the two, they&amp;rsquo;re either my top or second favorite urban fantasy series out there (the other being the Dresden Files) and I&amp;rsquo;ve reread each a number of times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around though, I decided to hit all of the short stories and novellas as well, primarily collected in &lt;em>Shifting Shadows&lt;/em>. Rather than one post per book, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to put them all in this one post, ordered chronologically within the Mercyverse. Any I haven&amp;rsquo;t read yet, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave as placeholders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good stories all and none seem critical for enjoying the main series if you skip over them. A bit more backstory, particularly for more minor characters though, which is appreciated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll try for minor spoilers at most, but I&amp;rsquo;m not always the most caring about that. :D&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Out of the Blue</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/28/out-of-the-blue/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/28/out-of-the-blue/</guid><description>&lt;p>Take part gay teenage lifeguard lover of rom-coms, just broken up with the Love Of His Life(tm), add a non-binary (because they all are) mermaid, sent on a month long &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumspringa">Rumspringa&lt;/a> to the surface, make it into a love story (of course) with all the (teenage) relationship twists and turns that entails&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&amp;hellip; and you have &lt;em>Out of the Blue&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That &amp;hellip; is not at all the sort of book I normally find myself drawn to (I picked it up for the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/bingo/2022-book-bingo/">2022 Book Bingo&lt;/a>), but you know&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s actually kind of sweet. And now that it&amp;rsquo;s over, I think I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have read it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Last Argument of Kings</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/17/last-argument-of-kings/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/17/last-argument-of-kings/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I have learned all kinds of things from my many mistakes. The one thing I never learn is to stop making them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so it ends&amp;hellip; for now. Some of our old friends (more or less) are dead, some are broken, and some &amp;hellip; miraculously seem to have gotten everything they wanted in life. There are more surprises and political shifts than one knows how to deal with, a chunk more of world building around the First and Second Laws, and all manner of battles and death and destruction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It remains fascinating what Abercrombie can do with characters. Glokta is a terrible person&amp;ndash;and he makes us root for him. Logen is a berserker in the truest sense&amp;ndash;and he makes us feel sorry for him. Jezal is excellent at failing upward&amp;ndash;and he makes us feel sorry for him. It&amp;rsquo;s all around amazing and the real strength of the series.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/14/the-first-fifteen-lives-of-harry-august/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/14/the-first-fifteen-lives-of-harry-august/</guid><description>&lt;p>Take the timeloop premise of Groundhog Day (et al), apply it to lifetimes, add a few neat worldbuilding twists, break things up with a cataclysm coming back through time&amp;hellip; and you have The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August. I love all of those things, so of course, I love this book as well. :D&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 3: Dead Man's Knock</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/10/the-unwritten-vol.-3-dead-mans-knock/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/10/the-unwritten-vol.-3-dead-mans-knock/</guid><description>&lt;p>He&amp;rsquo;s on the run and&amp;ndash;eventually&amp;ndash;starting to accept his destiny. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to get further into who everyone is and how the world works.

In this case, the Lipan (Apache) people of what became the southwestern US down into Mexico. The idea of a world inhabited by animal people&amp;ndash;those that can shape shift between an animal and a human form&amp;ndash;that was once connected to Earth&amp;hellip; and now is not.
“And if they don’t?” I muttered. “Pfft. You’re a cottonmouth,” she snickered.</description></item><item><title>The Galaxy, and the Ground Within</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/22/the-galaxy-and-the-ground-within/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/22/the-galaxy-and-the-ground-within/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>People – a group comprised of every sapient species, organic or otherwise – were chaos, but chaos was good. Chaos was the only sensible conclusion. There was no law that was just in every situation, no blanket rule that could apply to everyone, no explanation that accounted for every component. This did not mean that laws and rules were not helpful, or that explanations should not be sought, but rather that there should be no fear in changing them as needed, for nothing in the universe ever held still.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh, I do love these books. Especially on audio. There just such a delightful take on the sci-fi &amp;lsquo;slice of life&amp;rsquo; genre. Once again, it&amp;rsquo;s a new cast and new stories, with loose tiebacks to the previous characters (seeing Pei and hearing her talk about Ashby is a nice change of view). Chambers really shines at taking a bunch of weird and wonderful aliens, sticking them in a tight space (this time what&amp;rsquo;s essentially a &amp;lsquo;space truck stop&amp;rsquo;) for a few days, and seeing what happens. Nothing earthshaking&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> or deadly&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, but a lot of interpersonal drama. It&amp;rsquo;s great. Worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 2: Inside Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/22/the-unwritten-vol.-2-inside-man/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/22/the-unwritten-vol.-2-inside-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>Things are starting to move now! Prison, dedicated journalists, some real magic, and death. I’ll still trying to figure out the rules, but I’m enjoying it so far!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Outside</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/21/the-outside/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/21/the-outside/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Well, it did what Outside usually did in stories. Showed up. Violated all the known laws of physics. Killed some people and drove the rest mad.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s certainly an interesting book. It&amp;rsquo;s one part autism as &amp;lsquo;different, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay and sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a superpower and sometimes it sucks&amp;rsquo;, one part cosmic horror, and one part fascinating worldbuilding with technoreligion writ large.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it didn&amp;rsquo;t quite feel finished to me. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of setup, but the ending drew somewhere between a true horror ending and something much &amp;lsquo;better&amp;rsquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s potential for a sequel there, but without it, it could have been better. Still an enjoyable enough read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Before They Are Hanged</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/20/before-they-are-hanged/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/20/before-they-are-hanged/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We should forgive our enemies, but not before they are hanged.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Before They Are Hanged takes &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/31/the-blade-itself/">The Blade Itself&lt;/a> and takes everything up a notch. It&amp;rsquo;s still a dark and twisted world, there are still terrible people on all sides&amp;hellip; but now we have even more hints and worldbuilding on darker things coming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a worthwhile continuation to the first story and I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to see where it goes next. The narration in particular remains well worth it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 1: Tommy Taylor and the Bogus Identity</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/20/the-unwritten-vol.-1-tommy-taylor-and-the-bogus-identity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/20/the-unwritten-vol.-1-tommy-taylor-and-the-bogus-identity/</guid><description>Well that’s a start. A world where Tommy Taylor is a modern hidden world fantasy even bigger than Harry Potter… until the author disappears, leaving behind disillusioned son Tom Taylor. There are more than hints of a darker truth behind the story, hidden worlds within hidden worlds. And a section at the end establishing how far back in time the truth goes.
So far, a fascinating sort of story. Well written and illustrated.</description></item><item><title>The Rage of Dragons</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/17/the-rage-of-dragons/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/17/the-rage-of-dragons/</guid><description>&lt;p>African-inspired Bronze-age fantasy with piles of caste based tensions, crazy sword battles, interesting magic, demons, dragons, and the distinct feeling that the &amp;lsquo;good guys&amp;rsquo; might not actually be that good after all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m reminded a lot of Ender&amp;rsquo;s Game (which I love and need to re-read at some point) in that you have a surprisingly good soldier that manages to train harder and break the rules, breaking down society as he goes. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot darker though and Tau (said soldier) is motivated almost entirely by vengeance. It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a lot to read at times, but it fits. Man he&amp;rsquo;s stupid at times for it though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a great book and worth the read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fugitive Telemetry</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/06/fugitive-telemetry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/06/fugitive-telemetry/</guid><description>&lt;p>An odd book. It&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be #6 in the series, but really, it&amp;rsquo;s a prequel to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/29/network-effect/">Network Effect&lt;/a>. There&amp;rsquo;s not much you need to know between the two, so you can read them in either order and if it were up to me, I&amp;rsquo;d probably swap them (mostly because I want to know what happens next!), but it still works.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Mysterious Benedict Society</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/02/the-mysterious-benedict-society/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/02/the-mysterious-benedict-society/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that took a while to read. I read it outloud, part of a chapter a night many nights, and it still took a few months. Glad I did it though, it&amp;rsquo;s a great book, especially for kids, but even more so to read aloud with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a story about a group of children, each lost and/or alone in different ways, each brilliant (as the first section and a series of tests shows both to them and to us) and thus necessary for a &lt;em>SECRET MISSION&lt;/em>. I won&amp;rsquo;t go much more into that, but once they get out on the mission and have to prove that they are more than up to the task&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Blade Itself</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/31/the-blade-itself/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/31/the-blade-itself/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Every man has his excuses, and the more vile the man becomes, the more touching the story has to be. What is my story now, I wonder?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Joe Abercrombie / The Blade Itself have long held a highly recommended spot on my to read lis, so when I caught the audiobook on Libby/the Indiana Digital Library&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> I figured it was about time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quick version: it&amp;rsquo;s wonderful, but also &lt;em>very&lt;/em> dark. One of the main characters is a barbarian who&amp;rsquo;s family was recently killed, another is a soldier crippled in war turned torturer. And somehow, Abercrombie actually really makes you feel for the both of them, but man it takes a bit&amp;hellip; On top of that, there&amp;rsquo;s some fascinating hints of magic&amp;ndash;plus some more overt examples, no less terrible, when we meet Bayaz&amp;ndash;the First of the Magi&amp;hellip; or is he?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Network Effect</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/29/network-effect/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/29/network-effect/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>So that was what had happened before the survey. Now we’re here, ready for the next major disaster. (Spoiler warning.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a full length Murderbot novel! Yay! And it gets far deeper and weirder into corners of the worldbuilding we&amp;rsquo;ve only had hints of before. I love seeing the hints of tension with the corporations and how much control they hvaqe, the weirdness that is alien remnants, and the knowledge that there are super weird problems out there that aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily directly related to Murderbot.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spelunky</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/29/spelunky/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/29/spelunky/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The games reminded me of something the author Haruki Murakami says in the intro to the English edition of Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman: “I find writing novels a challenge, writing short stories a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure.” In video games, we don’t have corresponding terms for novels and short stories—we simply have large games and small games. These Game Maker games were Murakami’s gardens: vibrant, intimate, and full of charm. Having just planted a large forest with Alec, I was eager to find my own little patch of fertile soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I absolutely love Spelunky. I remember playing the (now) Classic version when that&amp;rsquo;s all there was (even going so far as to decompile and mess with the source code, yay GameMaker Studio), spending hours on the HD remake (beat Olmec, made it to Hell, never did beat Yama)&amp;ndash;mostly on Steam, and more recently put just as many hours into Spelunky 2. It&amp;rsquo;s a great game and what little I knew of the story was already inspirational.

I read it long ago and &lt;a href="&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/06/19/redwall/">Redwall&lt;/a>">listened to it a couple years ago&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s a great story of animals basically doing the human thing in and around an abbey run by mice. It&amp;rsquo;s great fun so long as you don&amp;rsquo;t think too long and hard about which animals are sentient and which aren&amp;rsquo;t and how the vast differences in scale and lack of opposable thumbs could possibly work&amp;hellip; but other than that, it&amp;rsquo;s great fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Formatwise, I&amp;rsquo;ve read a few graphic novel adaptations of novels and usually they feel a little lackluster (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/white-sand/">White Sand&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/08/storm-front-graphic-novel/">Storm Front (Graphic Novel&lt;/a>) as two examples), but if anything was going to work, this was it. It&amp;rsquo;s already a lighter fantasy world with lots of light riddles and actions and over the top characters that fit just fine with graphic novels. And it pays off. As an introduction to this world, it&amp;rsquo;s a great alternative. It&amp;rsquo;s just so fun to see pictures of how someone else saw all of the characters from this world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well worth the read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>V for Vendetta</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/09/v-for-vendetta/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/09/v-for-vendetta/</guid><description>&lt;p>That’s quite a story; quite a world. I only vaguely remember the film, but I still hear Hugo Weaving’s voice as V and Natalie Portman as Evey. The bones of what I remember match though. A story of a world gone well over the edge and a man determined to bring it back—but at what cost?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fascinating read and worth the time. I need to watch the movie now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/stiff-the-curious-lives-of-human-cadavers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/stiff-the-curious-lives-of-human-cadavers/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Death. It doesn’t have to be boring.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s quite a book. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to try out one of Mary Roach&amp;rsquo;s books for a while and this one came up on the (digital) library, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a try. In a nutshell, it goes into the process of what happens right up to and after you die (including brain death and organ donation) along with the various things that might be done with your body afterwards (such as medical training and testing various products along with alternatives to burial).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“What I do is, I think of them as wax.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Theresa is practicing a time-honored coping method: objectification. For those who must deal with human corpses regularly, it is easier (and, I suppose, more accurate) to think of them as objects, not people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>“Amias Mitchell,’ Kip said. ‘Born aboard the Asteria. Forty Solar days of age as of GC standard day 211/310. He is now, and always, a member of our Fleet. By our laws, he is assured shelter and passage here. If we have food, he will eat. If we have air, he will breathe. If we have fuel, he will fly. He is son to all grown, brother to all still growing. We will care for him, protect him, guide him. We welcome you, Amias, to the decks of the Asteria, and to the journey we take together.’ He spoke the final words now, and the room joined him. ‘From the ground, we stand. From our ships, we live.

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s absolutely fascinating what Becky Chambers has done with The Wayfarers books. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/31/the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet/">In one&lt;/a>, we get a slice of life on a long haul spaceship with all sorts of aliens; &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/10/a-closed-and-common-orbit/">in two&lt;/a>), we get an embodied AI and a former cloned slave learning about being people, and now&amp;hellip; we get the most &amp;lsquo;human&amp;rsquo; centric of the stories thus far. It&amp;rsquo;s all about the Exodus Fleet&amp;ndash;a few dozen generation ships built from the ruins of Earth&amp;rsquo;s cities and launched into deep space what feels like a very long time ago&amp;ndash;certainly before humanity knew for sure there was anyone else out there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Edgeworld: A Little Chaos In Your Life</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/19/edgeworld-a-little-chaos-in-your-life/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/19/edgeworld-a-little-chaos-in-your-life/</guid><description>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a neat enough story and I really like the worldbuilding&amp;hellip; I just wish there was more of it.

What&amp;rsquo;s there even to say? It&amp;rsquo;s a story about a son and a father. About growing up Jewish during the rise of the Nazi party and during the Holocaust. About the ways that dramatically changes the lives of even those survive.
All told in a comic book style with different style animals for different races.
It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating way to tell the story (a (Jewish) mouse wearing a (Polish) pig mask to hide from the Nazis&amp;hellip;) even if / perhaps because it raises questions of it&amp;rsquo;s own.</description></item><item><title>Rogue Protocol</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/17/rogue-protocol/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 00:00:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/17/rogue-protocol/</guid><description>(There needs to be an error code that means “I received your request but decided to ignore you.”)

&lt;p>El is a super dramatic senior&amp;ndash;and she&amp;rsquo;s got her reasons, with the whole potential Dark Goddess thing she has going on&amp;ndash;and life is only getting weirder. She&amp;rsquo;s determined to get &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em> out, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the least bit of sense and she&amp;rsquo;s absolutely going to do it in world ending style. Oh, and of course there&amp;rsquo;s Orion. What&amp;rsquo;s up with that relationship, am I right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, if you loved &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/13/a-deadly-education/">A Deadly Education&lt;/a> (as I did), you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to love The Last Graduate. It turns the whole Scholomance craziness up to 11, gives us a dark chosen one that actually kind of works within the world building, and I really do love and care for the characters.

&lt;p>When constructs were first developed, they were originally supposed to have a pre-sentient level of intelligence, like the dumber variety of bot. But you can’t put something as dumb as a hauler bot in charge of security for anything without spending even more money for expensive company-employed human supervisors. So they made us smarter. The anxiety and depression were side effects.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Murderbot is out on their own! It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting change of pace from the previous story, where Muderbot was still in the role of SecUnit&amp;hellip; On the way, it runs into ART (a spaceship AI; not it&amp;rsquo;s real name, it stands for Asshole Research Transport; three guesses who that&amp;rsquo;s from&amp;hellip;) who turns out to be a great ally.

&lt;p>This is an exercise in fictional science, or science fiction, if you like that better. Not for amusement: science fiction in the service of science. Or just science, if you agree that fiction is part of it, always was, and always will be as long as our brains are only minuscule fragments of the universe, much too small to hold all the facts of the world but not too idle to speculate about them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What am I in for…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it’s an interesting read. In a nutshell, it builds up a model for ‘vehicles’ that start with a single wheel and basic sensor and grows, adding better senses and in particular a more and more complicated brain. I would have liked something a bit more technical and/or practical but there are a lot of interesting ideas here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One downside, the wording is … a bit pretentious at times. Academic is probably a better word. Above is the first paragraph.. and that’s really how it stays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, an interesting enough and surprisingly quick read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Deadly Education</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/13/a-deadly-education/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/13/a-deadly-education/</guid><description>Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s a joy of a book. Saying which I suppose&amp;ndash;after you&amp;rsquo;ve read it&amp;ndash;feels a bit ironic.
It&amp;rsquo;s one part magic school, with your more or less typical teenage protagonists doing more or less typical teenage thing. In my opinion, Novik does this very well. Main character El (short for Galadriel) is so wonderfully snarky and done with it teenage girl that I could practically feel her angst coming off the page&amp;ndash;and it&amp;rsquo;s all the better, because she really does have a good reason for it.</description></item><item><title>Paradise Lost</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/12/paradise-lost/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/12/paradise-lost/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s an odd sort of book. It&amp;rsquo;s basically the story of the Fall of Satan plus Genesis, wrapped up in some crazy flowery poetry, writ long. It&amp;rsquo;s been on my &amp;lsquo;why not&amp;rsquo; list for a long time and hearing more about it in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/07/daemon-voices/">Daemon Voices&lt;/a> bumped it up a fair bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Am I glad to have read it? Yes. Is it a good book? Maybe. The poetry is absolutely beautiful in some places, but the story is one you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard before, if you&amp;rsquo;ve any sort of judeo-christian upbringing, although it does embelish in spots. And oy does it get long. It thought there were 7 books for some reason, so when I finished number 7 and we&amp;rsquo;re barely into Genesis&amp;hellip;, well, I knew I was wrong about that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, the first few books with the fall of Satan are very cool and I&amp;rsquo;d say worth reading.

&lt;p>Life is terrifying. None of us have a rule book. None of us know what we&amp;rsquo;re doing here. So, the easiest way to stare reality in the face and not utterly lose your shit is to believe that you have control over it. If you believe you have control, then you believe you&amp;rsquo;re at the top. And if you&amp;rsquo;re at the top, then people who aren&amp;rsquo;t like you&amp;hellip; well, they&amp;rsquo;ve got to be somewhere lower, right? Every species does this. Does it again and again and again. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if they do it to themselves, or another species, or someone they created.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh. Wow. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/31/the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet/">The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet&lt;/a> felt like lightning in a bottle.

&lt;p>Turns out&amp;hellip; just like this. This is a very very good sequel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, A Closed and Common Orbit was a bit of a surprise. We only barely get any of the characters we know and love from the first book. There are a few hints of and references to them, but for the most part, we instead focus on Lovey/Sidra* and Pepper, learning once again how two very strange and different sorts of people can grow into a family.

&lt;p>I COULD HAVE BECOME a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.

&lt;p>Ashby eyed the readouts on his control screen. “I swear, our engines have never been running this smooth.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a great book. It&amp;rsquo;s a slice of life story, set on small starship travelling the galaxy chock full of some of the most fascinating and delightful characters I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a scifi novel in a long time. There&amp;rsquo;s not particularly a huge over-arching plot. Instead, our intrepid band of oddballs is off on a long mission (it&amp;rsquo;s a Long Way after all) to the edge (center?) of &amp;lsquo;known&amp;rsquo; space.
