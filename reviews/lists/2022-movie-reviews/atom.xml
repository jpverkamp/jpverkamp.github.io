In years past, I&amp;rsquo;ve done a seperate post for my &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/2021-reading-retrospective/">2021 Reading Retrospective&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/2021-tv-movies-retrospective/">2021 TV &amp;amp; Movies Retrospective&lt;/a>, but&amp;hellip; that seems silly. Let&amp;rsquo;s do them all together this year!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In summary:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>126 total books: 40 graphic novels, 52 audiobooks, and 8 short stories / children&amp;rsquo;s books)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>24 seasons of TV shows&lt;/li>
&lt;li>31 movies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2245 (!) plays across 207 different board games, 88 of them new to me!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>45 different games played on Steam, 29 of them new to me&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I really should add board games and Steam games to my lists. Not sure how to do that though. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of a truely delightful era&amp;ndash;that of the Disney animated classics. While they&amp;rsquo;ve certainly got their problems (the rather traditional gender roles and Disney&amp;rsquo;s ongoing copyright battles to name a pair), they&amp;rsquo;re still something elegant and innocent about them and Snow White is no exception.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Up</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/08/up/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/08/up/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whelp. That&amp;rsquo;s one major tear jerker of an intro. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even need words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest of the movie is a pretty fun romp of an adventure as well. The old man, too old for this crap / young boy just trying so very hard to do the right thing is great; the talking collars and how dogs think is hilarious; and the adventurey bits are solid and almost too exciting (depending on the age of the viewers).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A solid Pixar, well worth watching.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Free Guy</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/07/free-guy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/07/free-guy/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Guy: I know this world is just a game, but this place, these people, that&amp;rsquo;s all I have. So I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna be the good guy. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be a great guy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Molotov Girl: [inhales] Wow, enjoy your lifetime supply of virginity.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds playing a guy named Guy in a game&amp;ndash;but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t realize it. It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a lot of fun. Once you get the basic idea, you&amp;rsquo;ve got pretty much the entire plot, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun and well done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/movies/attachments/free-guy-62ba5c.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a watch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Everything Everywhere All at Once</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/23/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/23/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/</guid><description>&lt;p>Laundry and taxes. Hotdog fingers and Raccacoonie. Googly third eyes and sex toy fueled kung fu fights. The truest &lt;em>everything&lt;/em> bagel there ever was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well that was a delightfully &lt;em>weird&lt;/em> movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If anything at all of that sounds interesting (especially the &lt;em>weird&lt;/em> part) and you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen this movie yet, go see it. Don&amp;rsquo;t spoil it. I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Land Before Time</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/13/the-land-before-time/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/13/the-land-before-time/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually watched any of the &lt;em>Land Before Time&lt;/em> movie. They just didn&amp;rsquo;t really come up in our childhood. On watching them now with my own children&amp;ndash;I see why they exist and why some children would get absolutely stuck on them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thor: Love and Thunder</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/31/thor-love-and-thunder/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/31/thor-love-and-thunder/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/28/thor/">Thor&lt;/a> was probably the most underwhelming of Phase 1, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/12/thor-the-dark-world/">Thor: The Dark World&lt;/a> tried to go more fantasy and was mostly forgettable, and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/16/thor-ragnarok/">Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/a> was a blast. Getting better all the time, so &amp;hellip; what about &lt;em>Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good question. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to love about the movie: Hemsworth&amp;rsquo;s sense of humor, Portman back and then some, Thompson&amp;rsquo;s awesome and slightly awkward Valkyrie. And of course Bale plays a solidly terrifying baddy in Gorr.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, there is a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of movie to get through here, probably more than a bit too much. A cancer plot, succession jealousy, a threat spanning across the Galaxy (or at least the gods thereof)&amp;ndash;heck, the idea that gods are just &lt;em>a thing&lt;/em> now, Thor unpacking even more trauma. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot to put into a single movie and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>quite&lt;/em> work. It&amp;rsquo;s still a solid enough flick, but not nearly up to what &lt;em>Ragnarok&lt;/em> did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, pretty impressive for the first 4th solo outing in the MCU. Because that&amp;rsquo;s a thing we can say now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/29/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/29/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness/</guid><description>&lt;p>So. That&amp;rsquo;s what what you get if you take a &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/directors/sam-raimi">director best known for his horror movies&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and let them loose in the MCU.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like it. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Underworld: Rise of the Lycans</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/27/underworld-rise-of-the-lycans/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/27/underworld-rise-of-the-lycans/</guid><description>&lt;p>Always interesting when a series decides to go back and do a prequel. For this though, given that we&amp;rsquo;re specifically dealing with centuries old immortals (especially ones killed in the previous films, thus not exactly available for any more sequels), there&amp;rsquo;s certainly room for it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eternals</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/25/eternals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/25/eternals/</guid><description>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ancient aliens sent to Earth thousands of years ago to protect&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> humanity&amp;hellip; but only from very specific threats. Loki and the Chitauri? Nah. Hydra? Nope. Thanos? Of course not. A whole cast of superheroes&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and we&amp;rsquo;ve never seen them before&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&amp;ndash;and I doubt that any of the should-be-worldwide-news events in this film will make it into any of the others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you ignore all that though, it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting enough idea, especially once you start digging into the greater cosmic plot. There&amp;rsquo;s even more to unpack than we even get a chance to look at in that movie. I really do want to know where it goes next&amp;ndash;and if there will be any impact at all on the greater MCU.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Underworld: Evolution</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/17/underworld-evolution/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/17/underworld-evolution/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quite an interesting contrast compared to the first &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/underworld/">Underworld&lt;/a>. Where the first was a straight forward vampire/werewolf urban fantasy action flick, Evolution tries to be more. We get deeper worldbuilding, more backstory&amp;ndash;especially for Selene&amp;ndash;and more hints that the entire world is changing. It works&amp;hellip; well enough?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Underworld</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/15/underworld/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/15/underworld/</guid><description>&lt;p>Modern Day. Vampires versus Werewolves. That&amp;rsquo;s basically Underworld in a nutshell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily, it does it very well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Constantine</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/17/constantine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/17/constantine/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I went through and read the entire (modern) catalogue of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/14/hellblazer-vol.-1-original-sins/">Hellblazer&lt;/a> and rewatched &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-matrix/">The Matrix&lt;/a>. So&amp;hellip; let&amp;rsquo;s give the 2005 Constantine film another try!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Matrix Revolutions</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/14/the-matrix-revolutions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/14/the-matrix-revolutions/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh the Matrix Revolutions. In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/11/the-matrix-reloaded/">The Matrix Reloaded&lt;/a>: Part 2. We cut in right as that one ended, with Neo out for the count, robots descending on Zion, and Smith doing&amp;hellip; whatever Smith is doing. I particularly appreciate the idea of humans, programs, and machines perhaps finding common ground (which &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/30/the-matrix-resurrections/">The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/a> really got into).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Neo: I just have never&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rama-Kandra: &amp;hellip;heard a program speak of love?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neo: It&amp;rsquo;s a&amp;hellip; human emotion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rama-Kandra: No, it is a word. What matters is the connection the word implies. I see that you are in love. Can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neo: Anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rama-Kandra: Then perhaps the reason you&amp;rsquo;re here is not so different from the reason I&amp;rsquo;m here.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>The Matrix Reloaded</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/11/the-matrix-reloaded/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/11/the-matrix-reloaded/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Morpheus: [Morpheus addresses the people of Zion] Zion, hear me! It is true, what many of you have heard. The machines have gathered an army and as I speak, that army is drawing nearer to our home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[the Zion crowd becomes louder]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Morpheus: Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us. But if we are to be prepared for it, we must first shed our fear of it. I stand here, before you now, truthfully unafraid. Why? Because I believe something you do not? No, I stand here without fear because I remember. I remember that I am here not because of the path that lies before me but because of the path that lies behind me. I remember that for 100 years we have fought these machines. I remember that for 100 years they have sent their armies to destroy us, and after a century of war I remember that which matters most&amp;hellip; We are still here! Today, let us send a message to that army. Tonight, let us shake this cave. Tonight, let us tremble these halls of earth, steel, and stone, let us be heard from red core to black sky. Tonight, let us make them remember, THIS IS ZION AND WE ARE NOT AFRAID!&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>More Matrix! I love it!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Toy Story 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/11/toy-story-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/11/toy-story-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>For me, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/02/toy-story/">Toy Story&lt;/a> falls at just the right time for a blast of nostalgia. It came out when I was a kid and I watched it over and over again. Somehow, Toy Story 2, despite only coming out 4 years later, just doesn&amp;rsquo;t hit the same mark. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, it&amp;rsquo;s still a good fun movie and worth watching, but&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s just not quite as good.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Buzz Lightyear: Woody, stop this nonsense and let&amp;rsquo;s go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Woody: Nah, Buzz.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sigh]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Woody: I can&amp;rsquo;t go. I can&amp;rsquo;t abandon these guys. They &lt;em>need&lt;/em> me to get into this museum. Without me, they&amp;rsquo;ll go back into storage. Maybe forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buzz Lightyear: Woody, you&amp;rsquo;re not a collector&amp;rsquo;s item, you&amp;rsquo;re a child&amp;rsquo;s plaything. You - are - a &lt;em>toy&lt;/em>!&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>The Matrix</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/08/the-matrix/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/08/the-matrix/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh the Matrix. This movie came out at just the perfect time for me&amp;ndash;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t into the counter culture as much, but even then I was messing around with computers and hacking&amp;ndash;and I absolutely love every minute of it. It stands up even today, with a retrofuturistic sort of vibe that really still works even though it&amp;rsquo;s been twenty years.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/07/pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/07/pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales/</guid><description>&lt;p>After the smash hit of the first three and the downer that was &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/03/pirates-of-the-caribbean-on-stranger-tides/">Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&lt;/a>, I was cautiously hopeful that they could pull something off with Dead Men Tell No Tales.

&lt;p>Start with &amp;ldquo;Anyone can cook&amp;rdquo;, turn that up to 11 by making &amp;lsquo;anyone&amp;rsquo; a rat (because rats don&amp;rsquo;t belong in kitchens, get it?) and end up with a surprisingly touching movie about believing in yourself, doing whatever you set your mind to, and not having to necessarily do what it is that others expect of you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/03/pirates-of-the-caribbean-on-stranger-tides/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/03/pirates-of-the-caribbean-on-stranger-tides/</guid><description>&lt;p>Pirates of the Caribbean&amp;hellip; without Bloom or Knightly? At least they still have Johnny Depp I suppose. And Barbossa&amp;ndash;ish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Easily the weakest of the series.

&lt;p>Oh, I love the opening!&lt;/p>

So of course they&amp;rsquo;re going to make a sequel and turn everything up to 11. More Johnny Depp (yay)! More love triangles (boo)! More supernatural beasties (awesome)! More mythology (sweet)!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the plus side, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to like. As mentioned Depp is still great. That&amp;rsquo;s probably the number one reasons these movies are as awesome as they are. He just nails the roll.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pocahontas</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/07/pocahontas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/07/pocahontas/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of my favorites of the Disney animated classics. It&amp;rsquo;s a straight forward enough story that at least takes some pains to show the terrible way that European settlers treated Native Americans and shows that people are people and will often try to do the right thing, given a chance. The music is wonderful and the animation is really quite something that up even today.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it began.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is just such a fun movie. Johnny Depp is absolutely the star of the show:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Mullroy: What&amp;rsquo;s your purpose in Port Royal, Mr. Smith?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Murtogg: Yeah, and no lies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jack Sparrow: Well, then, I confess, it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Murtogg: I said no lies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mullroy: I think he&amp;rsquo;s telling the truth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Murtogg: If he were telling the truth, he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have told us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jack Sparrow: Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t believe the truth even if he told it to you.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The sheer number of wonderfully quoteable lines he has:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Norrington: No additional shot nor powder, a compass that doesn&amp;rsquo;t point north,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[looks at Jack&amp;rsquo;s sword]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Norrington: And I half expected it to be made of wood. You are without doubt the worst pirate I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jack Sparrow: But you have heard of me.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s on top of crazy pirate action (with a heart of gold buried somewhere deep in there), Geoffrey Rush&amp;rsquo;s spectacular portrayal of Barbossa, Bloom&amp;rsquo;s &amp;rsquo;everyman with a mysterious history&amp;rsquo;, and Keira Knightley&amp;rsquo;s beginning to work against the sexism inherent in the age and region (although that gets better in the sequels).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Toy Story</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/02/toy-story/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/02/toy-story/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/movies/toy-story.jpg">

&lt;p>🎵 You&amp;rsquo;ve got a friend in me 🎵&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh Toy Story. A solid animated kids&amp;rsquo; film that started Pixar&amp;rsquo;s decade&amp;rsquo;s long line of wonderful animated films. It&amp;rsquo;s a great film that for the most part holds up even now. Well worth the re-watch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do love the humor. HTe interplay between Tim Allen&amp;rsquo;s Buzz and Tom Hanks&amp;rsquo; Woody. Absolutely great.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Woody: All right, that&amp;rsquo;s enough! Look, we&amp;rsquo;re all very impressed with Andy&amp;rsquo;s new toy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Man: No Way Home</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/18/spider-man-no-way-home/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/18/spider-man-no-way-home/</guid><description>&lt;p>Finally got around to watching this. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did, it&amp;rsquo;s hilarious and an aboslute blast of nostalgia. Similar to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/29/avengers-endgame/">Avengers: Endgame&lt;/a>, I don&amp;rsquo;t know know if this would possibly hold up without the weight of all of the movies that came before it (I doubt it), but with that weight&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s really really good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s funny, it&amp;rsquo;s touching, and there are some really crazy action scenes. But the greatest strength of course comes from &lt;span class="spoiler">bringing back a half dozen villains and all three modern live action Spider-Men into one film&lt;/span>
. Would anyone have believed something that crazy possible, especially before Infinity War/Endgame? I doubt it. But it&amp;rsquo;s quite satisfying.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Encanto</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/13/encanto/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/13/encanto/</guid><description>&lt;p>Disney has really been doing quite well the last 12 years. Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6, Moana, and now Encanto? (I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen Raya yet) All really solid films. Encanto specifically, I really enjoyed. It&amp;rsquo;s got great songs, fun characters, beautiful animation, and a lovely story. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to see a story based on yet another culture&amp;ndash;Columbia this time&amp;ndash;Disney is really doing that well. Overall, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t quite put it to the level of Moana, but it&amp;rsquo;s just about there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/17/harry-potter-20th-anniversary-return-to-hogwarts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/17/harry-potter-20th-anniversary-return-to-hogwarts/</guid><description>&lt;p>You know&amp;hellip; I should really re-watch those movies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I expect is the case for many in roughly my age bracket, Harry Potter was a huge part of my life growing up. I think I got into it with the release of the 3rd or 4th book (can&amp;rsquo;t quite remember) and absolutely devoured each book after that the night it came out. I watched all of the movies a number of times. It was absolutely fascinating watching the characters in this other world basically growing up with me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now&amp;hellip; 20 years later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/15/star-wars-episode-ix-the-rise-of-skywalker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/15/star-wars-episode-ix-the-rise-of-skywalker/</guid><description>&lt;p>Given the internet&amp;rsquo;s backlast, I exepcted a lot worse. At least to me, The Rise of Skywalker did a pretty decent job of closing the loop on the saga that began a long time ago with the rise of Palpatine and the fall of Anakin Skywalker. Really, that&amp;rsquo;s the entire story, and you get that here in spades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were definitely some weird choices made in pacing (in particular, right at the beginning, they sort of drop the whole &amp;lsquo;Emperor is back&amp;rsquo; thing on us&amp;hellip; apparently the reveal came in &amp;hellip; Fortnite? Seriously?). We lose out on a lot of what could have been a cool story with Finn and Poe, although they&amp;rsquo;re still around at least. And I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine that losing Carrie Fisher did filming any favors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/05/star-wars-episode-viii-the-last-jedi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/05/star-wars-episode-viii-the-last-jedi/</guid><description>&lt;p>More Star Wars! I remember being&amp;hellip; somewhat disappointed. Tonally, they got away from the nostalgia of the Force Awakens. There are still some absolutely beautiful/powerful moments (the final battles over the salt flats or whatever those were were pretty cool), but not quite as strong as it was before. And there are all sorts of things that just feel &amp;rsquo;less magical&amp;rsquo; and more movie driven than anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, I liked it a lot more. It still has some issues, but it&amp;rsquo;s still a solid enough Star Wars movie and (in my opinion) worth watching.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/04/star-wars-episode-vii-the-force-awakens/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/04/star-wars-episode-vii-the-force-awakens/</guid><description>&lt;p>Woo, new Star Wars! I remember the hype when The Force Awakens first came out. It was pretty crazy to see new Star Wars for the first time (second time?) in years. And it&amp;rsquo;s pretty dang cool. It&amp;rsquo;s shinier than the original trilogy, a bit less stuck in the weeds (trade blockades!) than the prequels, and it leans &lt;em>hard&lt;/em> on nostalgia. Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s Star Wars! Could they have done something newer and more unique? Sure they could have.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Star</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/03/the-star/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/03/the-star/</guid><description>&lt;p>Not really sure what to say about this one. It&amp;rsquo;s the Nativity story told from the point of view of various animals, voiced by a few famous people (Kris Kristofferson as &amp;lsquo;Old Donkey&amp;rsquo; was pretty awesome&amp;hellip; also Oprah apparently?).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a cute enough story and the kids enjoy it. The songs are a nice touch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I expect this will be fairly low on my list for the year, mostly since I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;hellip; not really the target audience. Conversely, I think it will be the movie I re-watch the most times this year. Interesting contrast.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Grinch</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/02/the-grinch/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/02/the-grinch/</guid><description>&lt;p>Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s nostalgia speaking, but I really miss the 1966 How the Grinch Stole Christmas! It was basically a reading of the book with a great narrator (Boris Karloff, who amusingly is best known for a bunch of 1930-40s horror films) and a few new songs that really fit the Seuss style. Given that the Grinch is probably in my top 5 Seuss books overall, of course I like it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
