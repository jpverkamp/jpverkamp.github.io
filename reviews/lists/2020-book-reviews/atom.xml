That was a year. I went kind of nuts this year and read 239 books. Granted, that includes graphic novels (they&amp;rsquo;re shorter and read quickly, but they&amp;rsquo;re still definately books) and books I read with my children. But it&amp;rsquo;s still a total of 68k pages, averaging 285 pages per book. An average of 186 pages per day. Not bad at all. Some more statistics:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>239 books, 95 non-graphic novels/children&amp;rsquo;s books&lt;/li>
&lt;li>110 graphic novels, 120-371 pages, average was 174&lt;/li>
&lt;li>34 children&amp;rsquo;s books, 48-352 pages, average was 163&lt;/li>
&lt;li>26 audiobooks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>31 different series, 27 books were not in a series&lt;/li>
&lt;li>51 different authors, 24 had one book each, highest was 35 (Fables), average was 4.7 books / author&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Not bad.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Boys, Volume 9: The Big Ride</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/30/the-boys-volume-9-the-big-ride/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/30/the-boys-volume-9-the-big-ride/</guid><description>&lt;p>If was a filler, is a return to form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Homelander is nuts. Butcher is nuts. Everyone is nuts. Hughie meets the old boss and gets some more backstory (wow this world is screwed up) and is back into the game.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dawnshard</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/28/dawnshard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/28/dawnshard/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that was unexpectedly wonderful. I was all set to dive into the behemoth that is and then I noticed that there&amp;rsquo;s a 50k word &amp;lsquo;short&amp;rsquo; to read before it. I loved &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="34703445" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34703445.edgedancer">Edgedancer&lt;/a>, so let&amp;rsquo;s give this a try!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end, this I do not regret at all. &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="34703445" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34703445.edgedancer">Edgedancer&lt;/a> is a story that could was too long to be an interlude and too different to be in the main storyline, but having read it is a story that every much needed to be told.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Boys, Volume 8: Highland Laddie</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/28/the-boys-volume-8-highland-laddie/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/28/the-boys-volume-8-highland-laddie/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Warning: NSFW&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was &amp;hellip; not great. Hughie is having a crisis of faith (which is a long time coming). In doing so, he goes back home to Scotland&amp;hellip; and strange things happen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/28/the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/28/the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But I tell you one thing, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be immortal if it mean living &amp;gt; forever, cause then everybody else just die and get old in front of you &amp;gt; while you stay the same, and that&amp;rsquo;s just sad.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That is one heck of a story. In a nutshell: decades ago, there was a woman named Henrietta Lacks who developed cancer. While treating her, a doctor took a sample of her cells, which turned out to be rather unusual. Unlike any other cells found before (or since?), they never died. They just kept growing and dividing and living forever.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Boys, Volume 7: The Innocents</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/26/the-boys-volume-7-the-innocents/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/26/the-boys-volume-7-the-innocents/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Warning: NSFW&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

In the , we spend pretty much the entire story in Essun&amp;rsquo;s head, learning how the world of the Broken Earth works and watching the beginning of its end. In , things have gotten far worse as the cataclysm really sets in&amp;ndash;and yet there are rays of hope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most interesting bits to me was that rather than having three different points of view from the same woman&amp;rsquo;s life, this time we&amp;rsquo;re following multiple different characters in roughly the same timeline. We have Essun (etc) of course, but also a plotline with Schaffa the guardian (he&amp;rsquo;s was already fascinating and terrible to being with), and the third following Essun&amp;rsquo;s daughter Nassun as she comes into her powers and has to survive traveling with her father.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Boys, Volume 5: Herogasm</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/21/the-boys-volume-5-herogasm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/21/the-boys-volume-5-herogasm/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Warning: NSFW&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once a year, the comics run a big teamup event where all the superheroes get together to save the world from a terrible threat. Except&amp;hellip; of course they don&amp;rsquo;t. Instead, they go to an island resort and have a giant super-orgy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Boys, Volume 4: We Gotta Go Now</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/19/the-boys-volume-4-we-gotta-go-now/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/19/the-boys-volume-4-we-gotta-go-now/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/the-boys-4-2.jpg" alt="The-Boys-4-2">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Boys Universe, there&amp;rsquo;s a giant pile of superhero teams. There&amp;rsquo;s the Seven of course, but also all manner of just as twisted other ones out there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Boys, Volume 3: Good For The Soul</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/18/the-boys-volume-3-good-for-the-soul/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/18/the-boys-volume-3-good-for-the-soul/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Warning: NSFW&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

In our world, Eustace (no N apparently) has grown up slightly and is now attending a&amp;ndash;gasp&amp;ndash;hyper secular school&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. He&amp;rsquo;s still for the most part the better character he grew to be on his voyages and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see someone we&amp;rsquo;ve seen before. But in Narnia, his friend King Caspian is old, with a son of his own, missing for years in his own right. And of course Eustace screws up his first&amp;ndash;and perhaps last&amp;ndash;meeting with an old friend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along for the ride is the first new female character we&amp;rsquo;ve seen in a while: Jill. She goes to school with Eustance and the both of them are outcasts, being bullied. I like her. One problem we&amp;rsquo;ve always had with Narnia is that women/girls are either perfect (like Susan and Lucy) or evil (like the White Witch). Jill is a pretty decent yet still nicely conflicted woman. I love this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Boys, Volume 1: The Name of the Game</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/09/the-boys-volume-1-the-name-of-the-game/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/09/the-boys-volume-1-the-name-of-the-game/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently watched [ The Boys ](&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Boys-">https://www.amazon.com/The-Boys-&lt;/a> Season-1/dp/B07QNJCXZK) on Amazon. It takes the basic idea that if you give a number of average people supernatural powers, a good number of them are going to call all sorts of wrong&amp;ndash;even the good guys. So if the good guys are bad, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes%3F"> who watches them? &lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And&amp;ndash;before it was a TV show, it was a graphical novel! One absolutely chock full of the same schocking language ( &lt;span class="spoiler">Butcher to his dog: fuck 'em&lt;/span>
), violence (slightly less), and sexual content (much earlier) as the show.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Umbrella Academy, Vol. 3: Hotel Oblivion</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/08/the-umbrella-academy-vol.-3-hotel-oblivion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/08/the-umbrella-academy-vol.-3-hotel-oblivion/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it ends&amp;hellip; (for now?)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A crazy series and another crazy story. Or I guess multiple stories all tied together. It&amp;rsquo;s got a neat enough premise:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Umbrella Academy, Vol. 2: Dallas</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/02/the-umbrella-academy-vol.-2-dallas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/12/02/the-umbrella-academy-vol.-2-dallas/</guid><description>&lt;p>Onwards and weirdwards!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we last saw the Umbrella Academy, we were just getting to know all of the siblings for better or for worse and following them through saving the word one time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Edgedancer</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/25/edgedancer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/25/edgedancer/</guid><description>&lt;p>Edgedancer is a short story set in Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s Cosmere, specifically on Roshar of the Stormlight Archive. It features Lift, a young girl who was first featured in one of the interludes of interludes and now has a story all to her own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short, Lift is a lot of fun. She&amp;rsquo;s a surgebinder who can make herself &amp;lsquo;awesome&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;her term for it&amp;ndash;and basically ignore friction. She seems an overall good person with a somewhat odd sense of morals and has a way of talking and acting that will just leave you smiling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Fated Sky</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/23/the-fated-sky/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/23/the-fated-sky/</guid><description>&lt;p> takes what started and takes us on a journey to MARS!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one level, there is an absolutely wonderful feel to the technology in this book. It really does feel to me like a slightly alternate history 1950s/60s, flying a trio of spacecraft to the red planet. It actually comes to the point of making me think: if this feels this real now, then why in the world haven&amp;rsquo;t we been to Mars yet. Bring on the meteor! (Not really. That would kill an awful lot of people.) You can really feel just how much research went into this book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Umbrella Academy, Vol. 1: The Apocalypse Suite</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/23/the-umbrella-academy-vol.-1-the-apocalypse-suite/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/23/the-umbrella-academy-vol.-1-the-apocalypse-suite/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that is truely a bizarre read. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to watch the show, but figured the written form is short enough, I could read it first. It&amp;rsquo;s weirdly wonderful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, some random event makes women all over the earth give birth at once. 7 of the babies (that we know of!) survive and are adopted by the same man. Of course they all have super powers, so off they go to solve crimes!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fables, Vol. 22: Farewell</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/22/fables-vol.-22-farewell/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/22/fables-vol.-22-farewell/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it ends. It&amp;rsquo;s been an awfully long strange trip, that probably overstayed it&amp;rsquo;s welcome just a bit. But on the whole it&amp;rsquo;s been quite the story and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have read it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of neat having a page or two with the &amp;rsquo;last story&amp;rsquo; of many different fables. We get to see some like Boy Blue again, which I appreciate. Even if/especially if he (more or less) stayed dead.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fairest, Volume 5: The Clamour for Glamour</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/22/fairest-volume-5-the-clamour-for-glamour/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/22/fairest-volume-5-the-clamour-for-glamour/</guid><description>&lt;p>Of all the the ways for Fairest to end, Reynard knocking up a random mundie girl, a murder mystery among the non-human fables, and the final tale of Goldielocks was not where I expected it to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good story though, all told.

It wrapped up everything nicely enough. Instead it just keeps going. But here, we have a finale! Except&amp;hellip; &lt;span class="spoiler">everyone dies&lt;/span>
Not even kidding. After we&amp;rsquo;ve come to know and love all these characters, the big finale is them all getting together for one last battle &amp;hellip; and every one of them &lt;span class="spoiler">dies&lt;/span>

&lt;p>After that, the entire book basically takes the form of a series of smaller adventures, each taking a chapter or two. It reminds me a lot of Ulysses; perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s the boat connection. Each of the stories is actually pretty good (my daughter and I both particularly enjoyed the Dufflepuds. They&amp;rsquo;re just silly enough for her age group. That being said, it&amp;rsquo;s weird that the King can do something like that (leaving his kindom, potentially for years) and it means that the story doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much of an overarching plot, but it works well enough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fables, Vol. 20: Camelot</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/16/fables-vol.-20-camelot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/16/fables-vol.-20-camelot/</guid><description>&lt;p>Onward and Fableward, we&amp;rsquo;re almost to the end!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this volume, we have the story of a little girl wondering about Castle Dark / the new Fabletown (cute), Rose Red growing in her position as a Paladin of Hope and refounding the Round Table (it&amp;rsquo;s weird and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the point is), and Snow White growing darker as she loses her children/at least their childhoods and husband.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mariel of Redwall</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/14/mariel-of-redwall/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/14/mariel-of-redwall/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="7993" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7993.mariel-of-redwall">Mariel of Redwall&lt;/a> takes place between &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="201341" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201341.mossflower">Mossflower&lt;/a> and and once again splits the story, this time between Mariel, daughter of Joseph the Bellmaker on a quest for vengence and a(nother) sea rat attack on Mossflower Abbey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a lot of ways, these stories are rather formulaic. There always seem to be two plots: one threatening the abbey, and the other a quest guided by mysterious verse, with Martin&amp;rsquo;s sword along for the ride. That being said, they&amp;rsquo;re still wonderfully fun and whimsical stories and the repetitiveness is actually really nice when I&amp;rsquo;m primarily listening to them while walking/running/driving various places. Deep, attention seeking books these are not. Light fun tales of various woodland animals killing one another in the name of peace&amp;hellip; :D&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fairest: In All the Land</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/06/fairest-in-all-the-land/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/06/fairest-in-all-the-land/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fairest. The story of Cinderella, this time trying to solve a murder mystery as all the &amp;lsquo;fairest in the land&amp;rsquo; (there are amusingly many of them) are dropping like flies. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a fairly decent murder mystery and while you completely expect that there will be some way (MAGIC!) to bring them back in the end, there&amp;rsquo;s still a chance that they might not.&lt;/p>

For the children, only a year has passed, but for Narnia, it&amp;rsquo;s been far, far longer.

&lt;p>Home, like love, hate, war, and peace, is one of those words that is so &amp;gt; important that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need more than one syllable. Home is part of the &amp;gt; fabric of who humans are. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you&amp;rsquo;re a vampire or a wizard or &amp;gt; a secretary or a schoolteacher; you have to have a home, even if only in &amp;gt; principle-there has to be a zero point from which you can make comparisons &amp;gt; to everything else.

&lt;p>For the first, we live in a deeply screwed up world, where people (white, black, and everything else) are people, for better or for worse. People are racist, both patently and obviously and subconsciously. And it&amp;rsquo;s not enough to just ignore it and be &amp;lsquo;colorblind&amp;rsquo;, you have to be actively anti-racist. Thus the title on the book. There are a pile of fascinating thoughts in here and ideas for how to be better.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jade City</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/10/04/jade-city/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/10/04/jade-city/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>I wrote this story for you, but when I began it I had not realized that &amp;gt; girls grow quicker than books. As a result you are already too old for fairy &amp;gt; tales, and by the time it is printed and bound you will be older still. But &amp;gt; some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again. You can &amp;gt; then take it down from some upper shelf, dust it, and tell me what you think &amp;gt; of it. I shall probably be too deaf to hear, and too old to understand a &amp;gt; word you say, but I shall still be your affectionate Godfather, C. S. Lewis.&lt;/p>
