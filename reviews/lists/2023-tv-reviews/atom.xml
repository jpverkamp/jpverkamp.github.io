&lt;p>They couldn’t/didn’t get the rights to the third age, so instead we get much older stories. Stories after the fall of Morgoth but still during the end of the era of Elves and Númenor. Before the rise of the kingdoms of Men.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s a lot crammed into eight episodes. One might argue too much. Leaves some stories a bit thin. But really, having seen them, I don’t know what I’d cut.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a watch. Looking forward to season two!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Little Drummer Boy</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/08/the-little-drummer-boy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/08/the-little-drummer-boy/</guid><description>That&amp;rsquo;s cute. A fun art style that really fits these videos, it&amp;rsquo;s something I watched each year when I was younger. Great to see once again.

It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to realize that the song only came about in the 40s and this was only made into a movie in the 60s. Especially since that means that for such a well know &amp;lsquo;Christmas&amp;rsquo; story, it&amp;rsquo;s really got very little backend religiously.</description></item></channel></rss>
