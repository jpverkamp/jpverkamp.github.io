&lt;p>Only barely long than season 2, it still manages to pack quite a bunch. We have the &lt;a href="#1-be-right-back">prescient one (given all the news about LLMs/AIs)&lt;/a>, the &lt;a href="#2-white-bear">one where the world&amp;rsquo;s ended&lt;/a> (or may be a world has ended), the &lt;a href="#3-the-waldo-moment">politics are stupid&amp;ndash;ha ha&amp;ndash;one&lt;/a>, and the &lt;a href="#4-white-christmas">twisted and all connected one&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is quite the show. How did I miss this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to season 2!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>For All Mankind</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/for-all-mankind/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/for-all-mankind/</guid><description>&lt;p>Watched with someone that didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the show was about. A few minutes of &amp;ldquo;okay, so it&amp;rsquo;s about the moon landing.&amp;rdquo; And then the moment when he speaks&amp;hellip; Delightful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about &lt;strong>STOP READING NOW AND GO WATCH THIS SHOW&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m waiting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea of an alternate history where the Soviets made it to the moon is so fascinating. And it&amp;rsquo;s only made all the better by all the character moments and (surprisingly to me) other historical events &lt;em>not on the moon&lt;/em> we see along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s such a good show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to what they do with Season 2. What changes&amp;hellip; and what stays the same?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mr. Robot: Season 4</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/18/mr.-robot-season-4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/18/mr.-robot-season-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Wow. That really went quite a fascinating direction. I was wondering where they were going for the last few seasons, but really digging into the aftermath of the season 1 hacks + another big target + dealing with the fallout of the Dark Army + digging deeper into Elliot&amp;rsquo;s troubles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man. Quite a season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had my doubts in the run up to the final few episodes, but I think they really stuck the landing. This was quite a show, through and through. Well worth the watch.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
