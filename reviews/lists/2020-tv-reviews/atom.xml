      <description>The good/great:
Fair Game: Negotiating with the Goa&amp;rsquo;uld with Asgard as mediators!
Legacy: A typical &amp;lsquo;maybe you were crazy all along&amp;rsquo; episode!
Point of View: More alternate realities!
Foothold: Aliens in the SGC!
Urgo: &amp;ldquo;Comtraya!&amp;rdquo; A wonderful episode.
A Hundred Days: It&amp;rsquo;s kind of hilarious how often O&amp;rsquo;Neill gets stranded and finds love&amp;hellip; Still a touching story. I just want him to be happy.
Crystal Skull: I love this episode and Daniel&amp;rsquo;s grandfather is hilarious.</description>

      <description>Onwards!
SG-1 has saved the world and now they&amp;rsquo;re back to do it again!
We get the introduction of the Tok&amp;rsquo;ra (In the Line of Duty, etc; Selmac is one of my favorite minor characters of the show), moral questionable decisions (Prisoners), more Asguard (Thor&amp;rsquo;s Chariot/The Fifth Race), and the NID (Touchstone), and 1969 (time travel!). So many things keep happening and such great episodes.
I think one of my favorite episodes of the season is Message in a Bottle.</description>

      <description>Man, I love this show.
  Stargate is one of those shows for me that every time I see a reference to it, every time I hear someone talking about it, it makes me want to watch it again. This will mark at least the 5th time. And that&amp;rsquo;s counting the movie, SG-1 (10 seasons), Atlantis (5 seasons), Universe (2 seasons, although I haven&amp;rsquo;t see them 5 times since I watched them as they came out), and the follow up films.</description>
