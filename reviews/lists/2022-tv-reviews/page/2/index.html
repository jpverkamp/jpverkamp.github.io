A main character with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dissociative%20identity%20disorder>dissociative identity disorder</a> where their powers deal with but <em>are not</em> caused by their disorder is fascinating (and truly weird to be watching at the same time as <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/01/altered-carbon-season-1/>Altered Carbon: Season 1</a>&mldr;), the Egyptian background and characters are great, and there&rsquo;s are some pretty awesome scenes, fight and otherwise.</p><p>Castingwise, Oscar Isaac is awesome. I&rsquo;m amazed at how he brings both Marc and Steven to life. Ethan Hawke is a great maybe-baddie-but-maybe-just-a-different-point-of-view. And May Calamawy as Layla El-Faouly is a real stand out in just about everyway. I hope that we get to see more of them in the greater MCU, although I have no idea how that&rsquo;s going to work.</p><p>Speaking of which, this was so different from other MCU properties. It&rsquo;s got Egyptian gods and powers more or less walking around, which fits, but I do really wander how/if we&rsquo;d see them or their avatars square off against normal MCU level heroes. Tonally, it&rsquo;s rather different too. There&rsquo;s still an end of the world threat, but a lot of it&rsquo;s dealing with the internal struggles of Steven/Marc.</p><p>Overall, it&rsquo;s probably my favorite of the MCU TV shows so far&mldr; I&rsquo;ll have to rewatch it and see if it holds up. It&rsquo;s really quite good.</p><p><a href=/2022/05/06/moon-knight/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/01/altered-carbon-season-1/ class=clearfix>Altered Carbon: Season 1</a>

In a nutshell, it takes a cyberpunk future world where the technology exists to separate the &lsquo;mind&rsquo;/stack/DHF of a person from their body/sleeve. Really, it&rsquo;s primarily a tool for the wealthy to accumulate even more wealth and a number of the characters mention that we aren&rsquo;t meant to live forever&mldr; And that actually made me think. It&rsquo;s been something I&rsquo;ve always thought would be neat: to be able to repair or move into another body if this is damaged, to send me mind to other worlds, etc. But how in the world would people react to that sort of power and change?</p><p>At the very least, let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s better than what we see in Altered Carbon. Hoo boy.</p><p>Plotwise, it&rsquo;s part detective show that segues into murder/revenge/revolution plots with more than a dash of questions around identity in a world where bodies are quite literally and easily (if not cheaply) replaceable.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of rather graphic violence and nudity, but for the most part it makes sense within the context of the show. Certainly not one for the kids though.</p><p>The casting, I loved. Joel Kinnaman as Takeshi Kovacs nails the &lsquo;Envoy brought back&rsquo;, Dichen Lachman as Reileen Kawahara is a wonderful <span class=spoiler>example of long lives corrupting people</span>
. My surprise favorite? Chris Conner as &lsquo;Poe&rsquo;&ndash;the AI running an Edgar Allen Poe themed hotel that hasn&rsquo;t seen a guest in years/decades. He&rsquo;s such a surprisingly wonderful character.</p><p>That&rsquo;s quite a spectacular show. Well worth the watch. Now the confusing it&mldr; <span class=spoiler>apparently almost the entire cast was replaced for S2?</span>
It&rsquo;s something that the concept of the show certainly allows, but I don&rsquo;t know how in the world they&rsquo;re going to pull that one off. I guess we&rsquo;ll see!</p><p><a href=/2022/05/01/altered-carbon-season-1/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/19/locke-key-season-1/ class=clearfix>Locke & Key: Season 1</a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2022-04-19</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><p>I really enjoyed the <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/09/23/locke-key-vol.-1-welcome-to-lovecraft/>Locke & Key graphic novels</a>, so of course I had to give the TV show a try. Turns out: also really good. While they changed a few things with the details of how the keys worked that are probably more efficient to do in TV (not opening the tops of people&rsquo;s heads for instance), it&rsquo;s still got the same wonderfully creepy dark magical vibe. I do love the actors&ndash;Bode in particular does his part very well, as do his siblings.</p><p>Man that&rsquo;s a crazy show. Well worth the show (warning, it is dark, although not overly graphic).
