I hadn&rsquo;t actually read the books (although now I really wanted to) and for the first episode or two, I really thought it was some sort of cheesy YA fantasy, a la Hunger Games and the ilk.</p><p>But a few episodes in&mldr; and it really started to grow on me. The world building is fascinating, primarily the basis on a broad Asian setting, but with an emphasis on Russian roots, with some influences (in other nations) from China and India. The magic system is a bit cheesey and somewhat unexplained (so far), but at the very least it&rsquo;s pretty?</p><p>On top of that, you have absolutely wonderful characters/actors. Jessie Mei Li nails it as lead Alina Starkov, Ben Barnes as General Kirigan&ndash;plays his character rather well (<span class=spoiler>he actually has the gravitas of old, powerful, and twisted, which not everyone can pull off</span>
). But the ones that really shine are the Crows (I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re referred to as such in the show?): Freddy Carter as Kaz, Amita Suman as Inej and Kit Young as Jesper. There are rumors that they might get their own show and that would be <strong>awesome</strong>.</p><p>In any case, worth a watch. And we&rsquo;re getting Season 2, hopefully sometime next year?

It doesn&rsquo;t deal with the end of the world and only barely with the greater MCU (although there is a decent bit of &lsquo;how the world changes with superheroes in it, like Ant-Man&rsquo;s podcast and Avengercon).</p><p>What it is though? A awful lot of fun. Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan is just an absolute delight and really looks like she had a great time in the role. The whole supporting cast is great as well, especially Kamala&rsquo;s family and friends Bruno and Nakia.</p><blockquote><p>Kamala Khan: [whispers] I&rsquo;m a super hero.</p><p>[She runs off gleefully]</p></blockquote><p>I really enjoyed this. Especially when it leaned into the Muslim + Pakistani culture and the family dynamics of the whole thing.</p><blockquote><p>Sheikh Abdullah: I don’t need anyone on my side. I’m not even concerned if God is on my side as long as I am on His side. God is always right.</p><p>Agent Deever: I don’t have time for Quranic quotes. Excuse me.</p><p>Sheikh Abdullah: Actually, that was Abraham Lincoln.</p></blockquote><p>The big fights and greater threats were kind of cheesey and didn&rsquo;t mesh as well (especially the big showpiece in the final episode), but the down to earth human parts of being a teenager superhero? Awesome.</p><p>It&rsquo;s so hard to rank these any more, since there&rsquo;s just so much to love in the MCU. I think Ms. Marvel ends up pretty squarely in the middle of the pack&mldr; but I&rsquo;d still say it&rsquo;s worth a watch.

A main character with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dissociative%20identity%20disorder>dissociative identity disorder</a> where their powers deal with but <em>are not</em> caused by their disorder is fascinating (and truly weird to be watching at the same time as <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/01/altered-carbon-season-1/>Altered Carbon: Season 1</a>&mldr;), the Egyptian background and characters are great, and there&rsquo;s are some pretty awesome scenes, fight and otherwise.</p><p>Castingwise, Oscar Isaac is awesome. I&rsquo;m amazed at how he brings both Marc and Steven to life. Ethan Hawke is a great maybe-baddie-but-maybe-just-a-different-point-of-view. And May Calamawy as Layla El-Faouly is a real stand out in just about everyway. I hope that we get to see more of them in the greater MCU, although I have no idea how that&rsquo;s going to work.</p><p>Speaking of which, this was so different from other MCU properties. It&rsquo;s got Egyptian gods and powers more or less walking around, which fits, but I do really wander how/if we&rsquo;d see them or their avatars square off against normal MCU level heroes. Tonally, it&rsquo;s rather different too. There&rsquo;s still an end of the world threat, but a lot of it&rsquo;s dealing with the internal struggles of Steven/Marc.</p><p>Overall, it&rsquo;s probably my favorite of the MCU TV shows so far&mldr; I&rsquo;ll have to rewatch it and see if it holds up. It&rsquo;s really quite good.</p><p><a href=/2022/05/06/moon-knight/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/01/altered-carbon-season-1/ class=clearfix>Altered Carbon: Season 1</a>

In a nutshell, it takes a cyberpunk future world where the technology exists to separate the &lsquo;mind&rsquo;/stack/DHF of a person from their body/sleeve. Really, it&rsquo;s primarily a tool for the wealthy to accumulate even more wealth and a number of the characters mention that we aren&rsquo;t meant to live forever&mldr; And that actually made me think. It&rsquo;s been something I&rsquo;ve always thought would be neat: to be able to repair or move into another body if this is damaged, to send me mind to other worlds, etc. But how in the world would people react to that sort of power and change?</p><p>At the very least, let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s better than what we see in Altered Carbon. Hoo boy.</p><p>Plotwise, it&rsquo;s part detective show that segues into murder/revenge/revolution plots with more than a dash of questions around identity in a world where bodies are quite literally and easily (if not cheaply) replaceable.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of rather graphic violence and nudity, but for the most part it makes sense within the context of the show. Certainly not one for the kids though.</p><p>The casting, I loved. Joel Kinnaman as Takeshi Kovacs nails the &lsquo;Envoy brought back&rsquo;, Dichen Lachman as Reileen Kawahara is a wonderful <span class=spoiler>example of long lives corrupting people</span>
. My surprise favorite? Chris Conner as &lsquo;Poe&rsquo;&ndash;the AI running an Edgar Allen Poe themed hotel that hasn&rsquo;t seen a guest in years/decades. He&rsquo;s such a surprisingly wonderful character.</p><p>That&rsquo;s quite a spectacular show. Well worth the watch. Now the confusing it&mldr; <span class=spoiler>apparently almost the entire cast was replaced for S2?</span>
It&rsquo;s something that the concept of the show certainly allows, but I don&rsquo;t know how in the world they&rsquo;re going to pull that one off. I guess we&rsquo;ll see!</p><p><a href=/2022/05/01/altered-carbon-season-1/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><nav id=pagination-navigation role=navigation><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=First class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 1" class=page-link role=button>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2022-tv-reviews/page/2/ aria-label="Page 2" class=page-link role=button>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2022-tv-reviews/page/2/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2022-tv-reviews/page/2/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><footer id=page-footer role=contentinfo><nav id=footer-navigation role=navigation class=ribbon><ul class=main-navigation><li><a href=/archive-by-date/>All posts: By Date</a></li><li><a href=/archive-by-tag/>All posts: By Tag</a></li><li><a href=/atom.xml>RSS: All <sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li><li><a href=/reviews/lists/atom.xml>RSS: reviews/lists<sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li></ul></nav><div id=page-footer-content><div class=legal><p>All posts unless otherwise mentioned are licensed under
