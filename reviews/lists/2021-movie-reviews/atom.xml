      <title>Iron Man 3</title>

      <description>For some reason, I Iron Man 3 as a fairly week entry, but looking back to when I last watched it in theaters&amp;hellip; I actually liked it about as much then I do now.
On one hand, I really do still think they absolutely nailed Robert Downey Jr. as Iron man. He can do both funny and broken pretty well and has more than a few chances for each this time around.</description>

      <title>Mortal Kombat</title>

      <description>Shang Tsung: FINISH THEM!
 Mortal Kombat is an odd sort of movie. With 2 dozen games, 2 previous live action and 2 animated films, and all manner of other references and media, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of backstory going on. But really, it all comes down to some sort of otherworldly nasties coming to conquer the Earth, but they can only do so if they defeat Earth&amp;rsquo;s champion(s). Other than that, it&amp;rsquo;s really a vehicle for hand to hand combat of the most violent sort.</description>

      <title>Stargate: Continuum</title>

      <description>That was a far better movie (in my opinion) than The Ark of Truth. It basically felt like a slightly higher budget two part episode (although those already tended to be good) of the series and actually gave a chance to say goodbye to a few more people: In particularly Ba&amp;rsquo;al (RIP) and O&amp;rsquo;Neill, who really needed it. Not to mention a callback to the real villains of the show: The Goa&amp;rsquo;uld.</description>

      <description>You know, that was more enjoyable than I think it had any right to be. It&amp;rsquo;s the sort of movie that would have been far more spectacular on a big screen, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been to the theaters in a while, so I&amp;rsquo;ll take smaller.
All around, it&amp;rsquo;s a visual delight. Transporting Kong is hilarious looking. The Hollow Earth is an insane idea, but it&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful world and all of those big beasties to fight are a lot of fun to see.</description>

      <description>Stargate: The Ark of Truth is the first of two direct-to-video sequels to SG-1. This one picks up after the SG-1 series finale and concludes the Ori arc and throws in a number of other callbacks along the way.
 Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell: It&#39;s kind of weird not having a big bad guy to fight anymore. Lt. Colonel Samantha Carter: Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s how we felt when we defeated the Goa&amp;rsquo;uld.</description>

      <description>Hooo boy. When I first saw this movie (in theaters, in the before times), I was pretty much blown away. It was a big budget, box office smasher of a movie, bringing together an entire series of super hero movies in one giant box office smash. It was something that had never really been done before&amp;hellip; and they managed to actually pull it off. And not only that (knowing what I do now), it was the start of something even bigger.</description>

      <description>Now that is how you do a super hero movie.
For anyone that&amp;rsquo;s somehow missed it, Captain America is the story about how a little guy from Brooklyn with a heart of gold and a steadfast determination to serve his country in World War II gets just that chance: taking a super soldier serum to get buff, becomes a showgirl for a while (because of course), fights Nazis, and gets frozen in the ice.</description>

      <title>Thor</title>

      <description>Thor is an odd sort of movie for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. On one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s our first foray into the more &amp;lsquo;magical&amp;rsquo; side of the universe, with ancient Gods and the like. Although in this universe, we&amp;rsquo;re led to believe that it&amp;rsquo;s really just highly advanced science. On the other hand, despite a worlds spanning plot (literally, 3 of them), it still feels oddly &amp;hellip; small.
Plotwise&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s weird.</description>

      <title>Iron Man 2</title>

      <description>I vaguely remember Iron Man 2 being a much weaker movie than the first Iron Man, but you know, it&amp;rsquo;s actually really good. The action is great, especially the fight scenes with the electro whips and between Iron Man and (not yet named) War Machine. Good stuff.
Characterwise, Don Cheadle is a great replacement as Rhodes; you can feel Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man at the top of his game (with nothing to lose because he&amp;rsquo;s dying); and I still think Paltrow makes a great Potts.</description>

      <title>The Incredible Hulk</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Banner: [in a poor Portuguese] Don&amp;rsquo;t make me hungry. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like me when I&amp;rsquo;m hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tough Guy Leader: [in Portuguese] What the hell he is talking about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of bummer that The Incredible Hulk is stuck in sort of a legal loophole and isn&amp;rsquo;t available with all the rest of the MCU on Disney+ (AÃ∏ÃúÃìLÃ∂Ã¨ÃΩLÃ∑ÃóÃã ÃµÃ¶ÃÇƒ§Ã¥ÃñAÃµÕìÕãIÃ¥ÃùÃìLÃµÃ∫Ãì Ã∂ÕñÃÑTÃ∂ÃøÕúHÃ∂Ã¨Ãä√àÃ∑Ã° Ã∏ÃúÃãMÃ∏ÃÆÃîOÃ∑ÃúÕíUÃ∂ÕáÃìSÃµÃ∫Ãè√ãÃµÃùÃÅ). On top of that, it&amp;rsquo;s the only main MCU superhero that they&amp;rsquo;ve recast (so far). Conversely though, it&amp;rsquo;s actually (surprisingly) a good movie.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Way back in 2008, I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone had the slightest idea how far the Marvel Cinematic Universe would go. Taking a less well known superhero (face it, before this few knew who Iron Man was), attaching him to a talented but troubled actor (Robert Downy Jr was an amazing cast) and make a fairly stock standard action movie and&amp;hellip; build a media empire that would span more than 12 years and 20 films (so far&amp;hellip;).</description>

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/24/a-clockwork-orange/&#34;&gt;very strange book&lt;/a&gt; makes for an even strange film. Who would have thought?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
