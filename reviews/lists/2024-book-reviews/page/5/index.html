At the end of Look Me in the Eye, Born on a Blue Day is mentioned as another similarish memoir of growing up with Autism. I saw it was available as an Audiobook on Libby, so I figured I&rsquo;d give it a try.
In a lot of ways, it&rsquo;s a similar book&ndash;they&rsquo;re both memoirs after all and both of autistic individuals no less.<p><a href=/2024/02/20/born-on-a-blue-day/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/18/look-me-in-the-eye-my-life-with-aspergers/ class=clearfix>Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger's</a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2024-02-18</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><blockquote><p>I am fond of the quote “When you’ve met one Aspergian, you’ve met one Aspergian. We are all unique.” That may be true, but now that I’m meeting other Aspergians, I am finding that some traits I thought were unique to me are actually characteristic of Aspergians.</p></blockquote><p>John Robison&ndash;John Elder&ndash;grew up with autism (or what would once have been diagnosed as Aspergers before DSM-5). He was always an odd kid and had to grow up quick and come up with all manner of interesting coping mechanisms to survive in a world that wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure how to deal with him.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t help that he had an&mldr; interesting home life, also described by his brother in the memoir <em>Running with Scissors</em>&ndash;and later planted the seed that grew into <em>Look Me in the Eye</em>.</p><blockquote><p>You should write a memoir. About Asperger’s, about growing up not knowing what you had. A memoir where you tell all your stories. Tell everything.” About five minutes later, he e-mailed me a sample chapter. “Like this?” was the subject line of the e-mail. Yes. Like that. Once again, my brilliant brother had found a way to channel his unstoppable Asperger energy and talent. When he decided to research our family history and create a family tree, the document ended up being more than two thousand pages long. So once the idea of writing a memoir was in his head, he dove in with an intensity that would send most people straight into a psychiatric hospital.</p></blockquote><p>Although found that although people didn&rsquo;t always do what he expected, electronics most certainly did. This lead to <em>quite</em> the career, building, repairing, and upgrading sound systems, including building a lot of the custom hardware used by the band KISS&ndash;and then later also getting into designing the electronics in toys and eventually repairing expensive cars.</p><p>Certainly not where I expected his story to go, I&rsquo;ll say that much, but the way he describes the story, each step just makes so much sense.</p><p>Another fascinating half of the book (to me) is hearing John Elder describe the world he lives in. I&rsquo;ll go into more specifics <a href=#aspergian-traits>in a later section</a>, but this was really the part of the book that stood out to me. Like the quote says/implies, every is different&ndash;and those with autism are no exception&mldr; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that people who&rsquo;s brains tend the same way might just see the world the same way. Some of these things I&rsquo;ve never seen put into words before. Worth the read just for that.</p><p>Overall, I quite enjoyed this book. If you have autism (diagnosed or not)&ndash;or if you know someone with autism (and I expect you do, even if you don&rsquo;t know it), I recommend giving it a read. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll see something of yourself in it.</p><p><a href=/2024/02/18/look-me-in-the-eye-my-life-with-aspergers/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/17/the-experiment/ class=clearfix>The Experiment</a>

You&rsquo;re not fully clean unless you&rsquo;re Zestfully clean!&rdquo; So much information condensed into so brief a format. So much emotional intensity.></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re starting to scare me, Ax.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Yes. The entire book is like that.</p><p>Oh, there&rsquo;s also something about a machine to remove free will, which seems to fall into the &lsquo;duh, that&rsquo;s not possible category&rsquo;:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I wanted to tell him. I wanted to say, Look, it can&rsquo;t be done. You don&rsquo;t understand! There&rsquo;s no such thing as a human being without a free will. It&rsquo;s . . . it&rsquo;s . . . idiotic! But he&rsquo;s no scientist, much less a philosopher. You can&rsquo;t separate a sentient creature from free will. They are free will. Yeerk, Hork-Bajir, human, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. A sentient species has free will like an object has mass. You can&rsquo;t separate them! But Visser Three doesn&rsquo;t listen.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Which&mldr; annoyed me more than it probably should have.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t know what free will is. But you <em>very much</em> can seemingly take away people&rsquo;s free will.

Then Rachel, in a whisper, said, &ldquo;What am I supposed to do, Tobias? I&rsquo;m a girl. You&rsquo;re a bird. This is way past Romeo and Juliet, Montagues and Capulets. This isn&rsquo;t Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio coming from different social groups or whatever. It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re black and I&rsquo;m white like Cassie and Jake. No one but a moron cares about that. We are . . . we can&rsquo;t hold hands, Tobias. We can&rsquo;t dance. We can&rsquo;t go to a movie together.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Even find love? (I enjoy their growing relationship.)</p><p>What it all comes down to?</p><blockquote><p>It suddenly occurred to me, right then, for the first time, that what I thought was so unique about me - that I was half instinctive predator, and half human being - wasn&rsquo;t so unique after all.</p><p>Every human - Jake. Rachel. Marco. Cassie, all humans - kind of lives on that edge between savage and saint. And the thing is that sometimes when you get pushed you do have to push back. And other times, you have to turn the other cheek.</p></blockquote><p>A solid story.</p><p><a href=/2024/02/11/the-pretender/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><nav id=pagination-navigation role=navigation><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/page/4/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/page/3/ aria-label="Page 3" class=page-link role=button>3</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/page/4/ aria-label="Page 4" class=page-link role=button>4</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 5" class=page-link role=button>5</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/page/6/ aria-label="Page 6" class=page-link role=button>6</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/page/7/ aria-label="Page 7" class=page-link role=button>7</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/page/6/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/page/9/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><footer id=page-footer role=contentinfo><nav id=footer-navigation role=navigation class=ribbon><ul class=main-navigation><li><a href=/archive-by-date/>All posts: By Date</a></li><li><a href=/archive-by-tag/>All posts: By Tag</a></li><li><a href=/atom.xml>RSS: All <sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li><li><a href=/reviews/lists/atom.xml>RSS: reviews/lists<sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li></ul></nav><div id=page-footer-content data-pagefind-ignore=all><div class=legal><p>All posts unless otherwise mentioned are licensed under
