At the end of Look Me in the Eye, Born on a Blue Day is mentioned as another similarish memoir of growing up with Autism. I saw it was available as an Audiobook on Libby, so I figured I&rsquo;d give it a try.
In a lot of ways, it&rsquo;s a similar book&ndash;they&rsquo;re both memoirs after all and both of autistic individuals no less.<p><a href=/2024/02/20/born-on-a-blue-day/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/18/look-me-in-the-eye-my-life-with-aspergers/ class=clearfix>Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger's</a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2024-02-18</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><blockquote><p>I am fond of the quote “When you’ve met one Aspergian, you’ve met one Aspergian. We are all unique.” That may be true, but now that I’m meeting other Aspergians, I am finding that some traits I thought were unique to me are actually characteristic of Aspergians.</p></blockquote><p>John Robison&ndash;John Elder&ndash;grew up with autism (or what would once have been diagnosed as Aspergers before DSM-5). He was always an odd kid and had to grow up quick and come up with all manner of interesting coping mechanisms to survive in a world that wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure how to deal with him.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t help that he had an&mldr; interesting home life, also described by his brother in the memoir <em>Running with Scissors</em>&ndash;and later planted the seed that grew into <em>Look Me in the Eye</em>.</p><blockquote><p>You should write a memoir. About Asperger’s, about growing up not knowing what you had. A memoir where you tell all your stories. Tell everything.” About five minutes later, he e-mailed me a sample chapter. “Like this?” was the subject line of the e-mail. Yes. Like that. Once again, my brilliant brother had found a way to channel his unstoppable Asperger energy and talent. When he decided to research our family history and create a family tree, the document ended up being more than two thousand pages long. So once the idea of writing a memoir was in his head, he dove in with an intensity that would send most people straight into a psychiatric hospital.</p></blockquote><p>Although found that although people didn&rsquo;t always do what he expected, electronics most certainly did. This lead to <em>quite</em> the career, building, repairing, and upgrading sound systems, including building a lot of the custom hardware used by the band KISS&ndash;and then later also getting into designing the electronics in toys and eventually repairing expensive cars.</p><p>Certainly not where I expected his story to go, I&rsquo;ll say that much, but the way he describes the story, each step just makes so much sense.</p><p>Another fascinating half of the book (to me) is hearing John Elder describe the world he lives in. I&rsquo;ll go into more specifics <a href=#aspergian-traits>in a later section</a>, but this was really the part of the book that stood out to me. Like the quote says/implies, every is different&ndash;and those with autism are no exception&mldr; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that people who&rsquo;s brains tend the same way might just see the world the same way. Some of these things I&rsquo;ve never seen put into words before. Worth the read just for that.</p><p>Overall, I quite enjoyed this book. If you have autism (diagnosed or not)&ndash;or if you know someone with autism (and I expect you do, even if you don&rsquo;t know it), I recommend giving it a read. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll see something of yourself in it.</p><p><a href=/2024/02/18/look-me-in-the-eye-my-life-with-aspergers/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><nav id=pagination-navigation role=navigation><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/page/11/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/page/10/ aria-label="Page 10" class=page-link role=button>10</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/page/11/ aria-label="Page 11" class=page-link role=button>11</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 12" class=page-link role=button>12</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/page/13/ aria-label="Page 13" class=page-link role=button>13</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/page/14/ aria-label="Page 14" class=page-link role=button>14</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/page/13/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/reviews/lists/2024-book-reviews/page/17/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><footer id=page-footer role=contentinfo><nav id=footer-navigation role=navigation class=ribbon><ul class=main-navigation><li><a href=/archive-by-date/>All posts: By Date</a></li><li><a href=/archive-by-tag/>All posts: By Tag</a></li><li><a href=/atom.xml>RSS: All <sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li><li><a href=/reviews/lists/atom.xml>RSS: reviews/lists<sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li></ul></nav><div id=page-footer-content data-pagefind-ignore=all><div class=legal><p>All posts unless otherwise mentioned are licensed under
