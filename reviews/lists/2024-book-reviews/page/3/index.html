Suggestions?”</p><p><em>Am Beast. Not Jane.</em></p><p><em>What am I? Chopped liver?</em></p><p><em>Do not need liver chopped. Have fangs and claws to chop liver.</em></p></blockquote><p>I do so enjoy the Jane/Beast dynamic. By far the best part of these books.</p><p>Otherwise, we have vampires coming back from the dead again that never should have, the Euro Vamps actually showing up after how many books, a crazy supernatural storm, and oh some many more timey whimey shenanigans. I&rsquo;m still not entirely sure what to think about it. It&rsquo;s unique, for sure. But oh, it&rsquo;s <em>major</em> power creep on Jane&rsquo;s part. I suppose we&rsquo;re getting on towards the end of the series and that&rsquo;s to be expected.</p><p>Other than that, my other favorite part of these books is the every growing Yellowrock clan. I never would have guessed it when I started this series, but the found family dynamic is so wonderful to read. They&rsquo;re all interesting and I&rsquo;ve grown to care for them all at least some fraction as much as Jane does. I&rsquo;m &mldr; not looking forward to some inevitable betrayals/deaths. :(</p><p>Other other than that, there is one problem I think I&rsquo;ve been having with this series:</p><blockquote><p>Gee was a bird, an Anzu, a creature once worshiped as a storm god. We had recently hunted together, both of us in Anzu form. I’d had a good long look at Anzu DNA when I shifted into the form, and that DNA was not from Earth, but it did look a lot like arcenciel DNA.</p></blockquote><p>When&mldr; did this happen? I don&rsquo;t think I remember it. There are about a billion short stories, so perhaps in one of those, but it feels kind of weird to have the mainline novels not more stand alone than that. Is it just me? (Or did I just forget something?)</p><p>But really, it&rsquo;s a wonderful series and I&rsquo;m looking forward to where it goes from here!</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/02/the-familiar/ class=clearfix>The Familiar</a>

On trial, in front of the Council of Thirteen themselves.</p><blockquote><p>I spoke to the holographic representation of the Council. Thirteen Yeerks in various host bodies: Nine Hork-Bajir, two Taxxons, and two whose host bodies were so concealed that I could not guess at their form.</p><p>They were dressed in dark red robes, so dark that they were almost black. They stood, motionless, held in place, suspended by gravity-neutral fields, fed by a continuous refined current of Kandrona rays.</p><p>The Hork-Bajir-Controllers wore a lightweight mesh beneath their robes to keep the wrist and arm blades from slicing through the robe&rsquo;s fabric.</p><p>The two Taxxon-Controllers were bloated, monstrously inflated versions of the great centipedes. Both were attended by Gedds, ready with freshly killed meat to feed the eternal hunger that not even a Yeerk inside that feverish brain can control. Their ceremonial robes were as large as sails, wrapped around the raised front third of their bodies.</p><p>They were light-years away, of course. They would see me, my host face and body in three dimensions. They could also watch my vital signs, translated into universal equivalents. Blood pressure, heart rate, hormone production, all reduced to digital readouts a billion miles away. And they could, with a thought, call up whatever data had been compiled on specific events or locations or individuals.</p></blockquote><p>I really do enjoy the worldbuilding here and I&rsquo;m a bit sad that this is about as much as we&rsquo;re going to get about the Council.</p><p>Still, it&rsquo;s yet another interesting point of view. Especially when you add in Visser One&rsquo;s testimony&ndash;the backstory of how the Yeerk invasion of Earth actually began.</p><blockquote><p>Tentatively I reached toward the far side of the brain. I touched it. Made contact.</p><p>Fascinating!</p><p>It was incredible. This second half of the brain was an almost mirror image, but not. It could have functioned all on its own, if necessary, and yet it was in some ways radically different in its memories, its sensory interpretation, even its will. Two almost entirely functional brains in one skull, communicating across a channel of nerves. Not a fully redundant system, almost a second, different brain!</p></blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s more interesting to think that humans are weird like that (and that is weird) or that seemingly no other species is!</p><p>I enjoy all of the <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/animorphs-chronicles/>Animorphs Chronicles</a>.
