Never doubt that.</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s one part jumping into parallel reality sci-fi, one part murder mystery, and one part YA adventure story (complete with love tangle).</p><p>For me at least, it works surprisingly well. I&rsquo;m normally not a huge fan of love tangles taking up a large part of a story. Here, I think it works pretty well. We have the additional tension of investigating murder. Plus having the feel of previously established relationships and growth throughout the story. It works.</p><p>Parallel reality / sci-fi wise, it&rsquo;s&mldr; light. There&rsquo;s not really much in the way of exactly <em>how</em> parallel realities work and what the rules are for moving from one to another. On the other hand, as a vehicle to jump from our world (ish) to a vaguely futuristic London. To one where Russian is still in it&rsquo;s full Czarist grandeur. To another where climate change has already flooded the world.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also interesting how on one hand you have the parallel reality &rsquo;everything is possible&rsquo;, contrasted throughout the entire book by:</p><blockquote><p>“There are patterns within the dimensions,” Paul insisted, never looking up again. “Mathematical parallels. It’s plausible to hypothesize that these patterns will be reflected in events and people in each dimension. That people who have met in one quantum reality will be likely to meet in another. Certain things that happen will happen over and over, in different ways, but more often than you could explain by chance alone.”</p><p>“In other words,” I said, “you’re trying to prove the existence of fate.”</p><p>I was joking, but Paul nodded slowly, like I’d said something intelligent. “Yes. That’s it exactly.”</p></blockquote><p>I feel like you can&rsquo;t really have it both ways&mldr; and the story doesn&rsquo;t really either. It&rsquo;s really just the latter.</p><p>Overall, I really enjoyed listening to this story. I&rsquo;m really curious where it goes from here. There&rsquo;s certainly room for the sequels, let&rsquo;s see what they do!</p><p><a href=/2024/05/05/a-thousand-pieces-of-you/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/04/24/the-left-handed-booksellers-of-london/ class=clearfix>The Left-Handed Booksellers of London</a>

But I remembered liking them well enough. And I haven&rsquo;t been back to The Seventh Tower in years (since I started writing reviews). But somehow in there I managed to miss seeing the Left-Handed Booksellers of London.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a fun older, lighter style of urban fantasy, set in 1980s London. You have magical booksellers, a missing parent (who of course is going to be magical), and all manner of mysteries, beasties, and mysterious beasties. On top of that, some delightful side characters (Merlin St. Jacques is my favorite) and some magically described scenes.</p><blockquote><p>I think Merlin has explained to you that the mythic landscape is layered, and usually quite local. Entities and environments are generally confined to a particular geographic area and often also to particular times of day or night, phases of the moon, that sort of thing. Even weather, as with the things that come out after rain, or only when it snows. And they are bound by custom and lore to behave in certain ways, to do certain things, and of course these days are mostly dormant anyway.</p></blockquote><p>I enjoyed this book. It&rsquo;s not up to the level of <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/10/01/sabriel/>Sabriel</a> and it&rsquo;s sequels, but it was a fun read and I&rsquo;m glad to have found it.

It&rsquo;s a delightful book and you&rsquo;ve probably already read it. If you haven&rsquo;t, you should.</p><p>What I can do though is <em>highly</em> HIGHLY recommend listening to the audiobook narrated by Andy Serkis (the voice of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies). Oh, he&rsquo;s <em>good</em>. And not just as Gollum, but as everyone.</p><blockquote><p>I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it&rsquo;s very difficult to find anyone.'</p><p>I should think so — in these parts!

Finally now, in The Quantum Evolution, we&rsquo;re starting to get some of the effects.</p><p>It turns out that by showing off his Quantum MAGIC!(tm), Bel has brought quite a lot more attention than he ever intended to Homo Quantus. And now everone wants a piece of him and his.</p><p>The characters still drive teh book. Bel and Cass remain Bel and Cas. Stills remains delightfully crass.

It&rsquo;s &mldr; probably worth something to have read it?</p><p>If this is the last book, it&rsquo;s a weird one. There&rsquo;s a big epic conclusion, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel completely earned. The stakes are higher than ever, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel particularly &rsquo;new&rsquo; this time.</p><p>Overall, the first book is the best. The next two are worth reading.

Time travel at a small scale can be a lot of fun. It helps you pull off heists after all. And yet&mldr; when you try to make it significantly larger, you really have to deal with the question: how does time travel work in this universe?</p><p>Well&mldr; it&rsquo;s never <em>entirely</em> answered. Things get all sorts of quantum and fuzzy. Effects proceed causes (and sometimes you get neat little loops with no original cause at all). Other than that, I&rsquo;ll let you see how they deal with it all.</p><p>I do still love the side characters the most. We get more Scarecrow, which is fascinating. And of course Stills and anti-piss (you&rsquo;ll just have to see it).</p><p>Overall, the first book is stronger.

I mean&mldr; look at it! I love the title and have a soft spot for the illustrated manuscript style.</p><p>And then on top of that, it&rsquo;s actually quite a delightful book as well. Win win!</p><blockquote><p>I mention this because that’s how the world changes. It’s either so quick that we never know what hit us, or so gradual that we don’t notice.</p></blockquote><p>In a nutshell, it&rsquo;s the story of an alternate history Earth. Take a roughly medieval european tech level empire and an army corps of engineers (they build bridges) out on their own. Add a force somehow conquering everything, leaving said engineers really the only remaining hope. And then stick them in a city, the only hope to hold off against a siege.</p><p>But what really shines (for me&ndash;and your milage really may vary on this one) is the tone. The main character is competant (perhaps too much so at times) and wonderfully snarky.</p><blockquote><p>I have strong views about not tempting providence and, as a wise man once said, the difference between luck and a wheelbarrow is, luck doesn’t work if you push it.</p></blockquote><p>Things that have always been done? About to be undone&ndash;in the name of defending the city.</p><blockquote><p>My belief is, either you understand things or you understand people. Nobody can do both. Frankly, I’m happier with things. I understand stuff like tensile strength, shearing force, ductility, work hardening, stress, fatigue. I know the same sort of things happen with people, but the rules are subtly different. And nobody’s ever paid for my time to get to know about people.</p></blockquote><p>Yeah&mldr; he knows people better than he claims.</p><blockquote><p>The people turn out to be—well, people; a collective noun for all those individual men and women, none of them perfect, some of them downright vicious, most of them monumentally stupid. As stupid as the emperor, the great hereditary lords, the priestly hierarchs, the General Staff and the Lords of the Admiralty, the merchant princes and the organised crime barons.</p></blockquote><p>Anyways. You&rsquo;ll know right away if you like this book or not. I loved it. Give it a try.</p><blockquote><p>Of the people, by the people, for the people. I can’t remember offhand where that quote comes from; it was something to do with some bunch of wild-eyed idealists overthrowing the tyrant so they could become tyrants themselves. No good will have come of it, you can be sure. The people; God help us.</p></blockquote></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/04/14/the-quantum-magician/ class=clearfix>The Quantum Magician</a>

Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone.</p></blockquote><p>A haunted house? Let&rsquo;s do SCIENCE!</p><p>Well, that&rsquo;s the claim. Mostly, it&rsquo;s a vehicle to get all our main characters in one place, plus a bit of conflict later on.</p><p>Other than that, we have character introductions. They&rsquo;re some weird folks&ndash;the best kind for these stories. And then the house as character. It&rsquo;s impressive how you can get such a feel for a place with only minimal (initial) description. And then the caretakers of the house. Quite the characters those two are.</p><p>And then&mldr; things get creepy. There&rsquo;s little jumping out of the page to scare you. It&rsquo;s not that sort of story. But it&rsquo;s creepy nevertheless. Perfecting that evermounting sense of dread. And at that, it&rsquo;s quite well done.</p><p>I think that I enjoyed this book more having listened to the audiobook. It&rsquo;s a slow burn and&mldr; hard to describe just why it&rsquo;s so intriguing?</p><p>Worth a try.</p><blockquote><p>Journeys end in lovers meeting; I have spent an all but sleepless night, I have told lies and made a fool of myself, and the very air tastes like wine.
