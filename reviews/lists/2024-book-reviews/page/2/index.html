The older I get/the more I learn, the more true I find this.</p><p>Reading books like this (or alternatively <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/07/welcome-to-the-autistic-community/>this</a> or <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/18/look-me-in-the-eye-my-life-with-aspergers/>Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger's</a> or <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/20/born-on-a-blue-day/>Born on a Blue Day</a>) helps. Discovering that there are other weird brains out there (I do love McCabe&rsquo;s &lsquo;hello brains&rsquo;) is wonderful. Seeing both how they see the world the same&ndash;and perhaps even more so, the differences even within these groups&ndash;is like a lightbulb going off.</p><p>Specifically for this one, the idea that just because you are (/ appear to be) succeeding at life&mldr; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that it&rsquo;s not coming at a cost.</p><blockquote><p>The fact that I could sometimes exceed expectations made it even more frustrating for me‚Äîand everyone around me‚Äîwhen I failed to meet the basic ones.</p></blockquote><p>I think that if you have ADHD&ndash;or have someone close to you that does&mldr; and chances are <em>really</em> good that you do, even if you don&rsquo;t know it&ndash;I think this book is worth a read.</p><blockquote><p>ADHD is a terrible name for the condition, because &lsquo;attention deficit&rsquo; implies a lack of attention. However, our brains can focus quite well sometimes&ndash;particularly on things we find engaging, such as our hobbies, crushes, video games, and so on. The trouble is, we can&rsquo;t control the intensity of our focus or what we focus on. . . . This big misconception makes people less likely to seek a diagnosis because they are able to focus sometimes.</p></blockquote><p>Explanations, tools to deal / adapt to a world that isn&rsquo;t necessarily built for you, and a ton of quotes from a ton of people.</p><blockquote><p>Over the years, we‚Äôve shared long, deep discussions about what it means to have ADHD. About how being ‚Äúnormal‚Äù isn‚Äôt a realistic goal but being functional is. About how sometimes, paradoxically, being functional means behaving in less (neuro)typical ways, so we can be more mentally healthy, happy, and generous humans for ourselves and for those we love.</p></blockquote><p>Well worth the read.</p><p>Onward!</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/01/rivers-of-london/ class=clearfix>Rivers of London</a>

<span class=index>#1</span></a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2024-11-01</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><p>Whenever I come across a &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read all of <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-dresden-files/>The Dresden Files</a>, now what?&rdquo; discussion, one of the series that always seems to come up is Ben Aaronovitch&rsquo;s Rivers of London. They&rsquo;re not <em>entirely</em> the same, but I get why people cross recommend them.</p><p>Basically, we have a London cop who stumbles upon a mysterious killing, questions a ghost, gets recruited by the &lsquo;magical&rsquo; side of the London police, ends up meeting and befriending several rivers (see, the title! Also, it ends up making more sense in the story), and saves the day.</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúAre they really gods?"</p><p>&ldquo;I never worry about theological questions,&rdquo; said Nightingale. &ldquo;They exist, they have power and they can breach the Queen&rsquo;s peace - that makes them a police matter.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>More or less.</p><p>I think my favorite part of the series (so far) is the humor, most especially the sheer Britishness of it (not being British, I have no idea how accurate it all is, but it&rsquo;s good enough for me!).</p><blockquote><p>He was from Yorkshire, or somewhere like that, and like many Northerners with issues, he&rsquo;d moved to London as a cheap alternative to psychotherapy.</p></blockquote><p>Oh, and also picking fun at it&rsquo;s own genre of course.</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúYou put a spell on the dog,&rdquo; I said as we left the house.<br>&ldquo;Just a small one,&rdquo; said Nightingale.<br>&ldquo;So magic is real,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Which makes you a&mldr;what?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A wizard.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Like Harry Potter?&rdquo;<br>Nightingale sighed. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not like Harry Potter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a fictional character,&rdquo; said Nightingale.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Second up, the introductions of magic. Any world where the characters try to treat magic as a science and figure out <em>how in the world it <strong>really</strong> works</em> is a great one in my book.</p><p>There&rsquo;s an <em>awful</em> lot of hinted at worldbuilding there. I hope and expect to see a lot more of that in future books. We&rsquo;ll just have to see which way all that goes.</p><p>Also also, having recently decided that learning Latin was just a great idea as our main character (although for (un)fortunately different reasons I suppose):</p><blockquote><p>Carved above the lintel were the words SCIENTIA POTESTAS EST. Science points east, I wondered? Science is portentous, yes? Science protests too much. Scientific potatoes rule. Had I stumbled on the lair of dangerous plant geneticists?</p></blockquote><p>üòÑ</p><p>Spoilers, I guess. üòÑ</p><p>Overall, I had a lot of fun with this book. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing where it goes from here!</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/31/other-minds/ class=clearfix>Other Minds</a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2024-10-31</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><blockquote><p>Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals. Because our most recent common ancestor was so simple and lies so far back, cephalopods are an independent experiment in the evolution of large brains and complex behavior. If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of a shared history, not because of kinship, but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.</p></blockquote><p>Octopuses<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> are perhaps the best known example of what might be a truly <em>alien</em> intelligence on Earth. They&rsquo;re far further from humanity than primates or dolphins or even birds. And man. They&rsquo;re weird.</p><p>This book digs into the history of life itself, the beginning of what would eventually become brains, and how life eventually split and branched into all the myriad forms we have today.</p><blockquote><p>In the Ediacaran, other animals might be there around you, without being especially relevant. In the Cambrian, each animal becomes an important part of the environment of others. This entanglement of one life in another, and its evolutionary consequences, is due to behavior and the mechanisms controlling it. From this point on, the mind evolved in response to other minds.</p></blockquote><p>This part? Very interesting.</p><p>We also get some fascinating discussions about some of the weirder things octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish do. Color changing, shape shifting, and independently acting arms. They have it all.</p><blockquote><p>Suppose some light-sensitive cells sit below a layer of many chromatophores. As chromatophores of different colors expanded and contracted, the light passing through them would be affected in different ways. If the animal kept track of which chromatophores were expanded, as well as how much light was reaching its sensors, it could know something about the color of incoming light.</p></blockquote><p>Also cool.</p><p>Octopus society. A surprisingly short lived and solitary species, and yet still in one case, they&rsquo;ve actually built something of a city in the ocean off Australia.</p><blockquote><p>A marine research unit at Monterey Bay, California (MBARI), explores deep-sea environments with remote-controlled submarines that carry video cameras. In 2007 they were inspecting a rocky outcrop nearly a mile underwater, off the coast of central California. They saw a deep-sea octopus (Graneledone boreopacifica) moving around. Returning a month or so later, they found the same octopus guarding a clutch of eggs. They kept returning to the site to watch the progress of this clutch of eggs, and always found the octopus there. In the end they watched this one octopus for four and a half years. This octopus brooded her eggs for longer than any other known octopus is thought to live in total, and the fifty-three months it spent there is the longest egg-brooding period reported for any animal species.</p></blockquote><p>Fascinating.</p><p>And then also a dive into consciousness. Which&mldr; we can barely explain or define what consciousness means for people, let alone verify it&rsquo;s presence in any other species.</p><p>It&rsquo;s entirely philosophical and not <em>really</em> my domain. Philosophy is weird and malleable and hard (at best) to actually put to scientific scrutiny. We can certainly measure some aspects of intelligence and communication and tool using among non-human species&mldr; but how in the world to you ask an octopus what it thinks about thinking? How in the world do you tell if they&rsquo;re actually aware of their self and surroundings?</p><blockquote><p>The second thing Hume missed is more conspicuous. When we look inside, most people find a flow of inner speech<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>, a monologue that accompanies much of our conscious life. Sentences and phrases, exclamations, rambling commentaries, speeches we would like to give, or wish we‚Äôd given. Maybe Hume did not find this in his own case? Some people have a more prominent inner monologue than others. Perhaps Hume was one of those for whom inner speech is weak? It‚Äôs possible, but I think it‚Äôs more likely that Hume did encounter inner speech, but regarded it as one part of the wash of sensations, not as anything special. There are colors and shapes and emotions in there, and echoes of speech as well.</p></blockquote><p>This whole part was a bit weird&ndash;which, being in the title, is kind of weird. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what I was expecting, but somehow&mldr; more?</p><p>And then&mldr; it ends. A lot of appendices and references meant the book ended rather before I expected.</p><p>A decent book with a delightful cover and a number of fun octopus facts I&rsquo;d never heard before. Worth reading just for that.</p><p>Onward!</p><p><a href=/2024/10/31/other-minds/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/30/fireborne/ class=clearfix>Fireborne</a>

They don&rsquo;t realize you can think from your knees just as well as from your feet.</p></blockquote><p>What we have here is an epic fantasy world, full of the aforementioned dragons and strife and war&mldr; but for a change, this world is set in the near aftermath of the collapse of the old regime and the rise of the good guys. In theory.</p><p>Everyone gets a chance at education. Even commoners&ndash;even orphans of the revolution&ndash;can apply to be trained as dragon riders.</p><p>From there, we get the first half of the book&ndash;a straight up magic school style training montage. It feels awfully YA, in the genre of <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/03/30/the-hunger-games/>The Hunger Games</a> / <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/03/29/divergent/>Divergent</a> / <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/harry-potter/>Harry Potter</a>, up to and including a school tournament to decide the &lsquo;best dragonrider&rsquo;.</p><p>What really makes the book shine to me is that initial setting&ndash;the idea that we&rsquo;re shortly after a revolution, building something new. And the entirely too real chance that the anything new&mldr; might be just as bad as what came before.</p><p>Now&mldr; the dragons. Despite the fact that all of our main characters have a dragon and they&rsquo;re present throughout the series&ndash;they never seem to really have any personality or presence of their own.</p><p>Even now, I don&rsquo;t think I could honestly tell you more than the subspecies of each dragon, and even then only barely. I like intelligent dragons (a la <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/temeraire/>Temeraire</a>) and <em>love</em> books with more <em>alien</em> dragons (<a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/17/the-rage-of-dragons/>The Rage of Dragons</a> shines here). These are almost more like cars or fighter jets than anything.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s really a bummer.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed the series.

The dynamics seem so basic‚Äîshapes changing in space and time‚Äîyet only now are the tools available to understand them.</p></blockquote><p>Chaos is the study of non-linear systems. Of fractals. Of &mldr; chaos. It takes the world we know it and proves that, at some level, we don&rsquo;t know anything. We can simulate the world to ever increasing levels of accuracy and at some point, things just blow up.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a neat idea, not nearly as weird as it was 40 years ago when this was written (and even then, three years before Jurassic Park made it really <em>cool</em>). I&rsquo;ve messed with <a href=/programming/topics/fractals/>fractals</a> more than a bit and studied quite a bit of higher level math in school, so little of this is particularly new to me&ndash;so I&rsquo;m probably ont the target audience.</p><p>Overall, this book is really more about the history and discovery of chaos, rather than necessarily digging into the math and how it really works (when we even know). It&rsquo;s interesting, but not what I was expecting.</p><p>So&mldr; I&rsquo;m glad enough that I read it, but probably wouldn&rsquo;t strongly recommended it. So it goes.</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/23/its-a-wonderful-midlife-crisis/ class=clearfix>It's A Wonderful Midlife Crisis</a>

Except&mldr; the plot is weak, the world building is lazy, and the romance doesn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> make sense.</p><p>I think the book sums itself up well.</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúOh God, Daisy,‚Äù ***** said, letting her head fall to her chest. ‚ÄúYou have it all wrong.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúHave what wrong?‚Äù I asked as a feeling of dread washed over me.</p><p>‚ÄúEvery good story has a major plot twist,‚Äù she said slowly, growing more agitated with each word.</p></blockquote><p>This is on page <em>155</em> of 164. Daisy (our MC) is finally <em>finally</em> learning&mldr; and still got it wrong. And it&rsquo;s not even (in my opinion) that sensible a plot twist. And then the book ends. It&rsquo;s very much set up for a sequel; without which, it doesn&rsquo;t really stand alone.</p><p>So&mldr; despite this being an oddly well reviewed book in general, it&rsquo;s just really <em>not</em> my cup of tea. Perhaps you&rsquo;d like it more. Perhaps it gets better.</p><p>Onward.</p><p><a href=/2024/09/23/its-a-wonderful-midlife-crisis/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/happy-birthday-mrs.-piggle-wiggle/ class=clearfix>Happy Birthday, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle</a>
