She really knew how to get under their skin. Under his skin.</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s time for my every year or two re-read of the <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/mercy-thompson/>Mercy Thompson</a> books, especially with a new one out! That&rsquo;s getting longer and longer each year, and I&rsquo;m <em>here</em> for it. I think these two series (including <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/alpha-omega/>Alpha & Omega</a>) are now my favorite Urban Fantasy series, beating out even the Dresden Files (although it is close).</p><p>Now, specifically for this book&mldr;</p><p>Man, we&rsquo;ve come some ways. The last few books have gone thoroughly into &lsquo;woo woo&rsquo; territory (as Mercy increasingly calls it), with Mercy learning and gaining all sorts of new and interesting powers over the dead (<a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/31/storm-cursed/>Storm Cursed</a>), learning more than she&rsquo;d likely ever wanted about Wulfe (<a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/03/smoke-bitten/>Smoke Bitten</a>), and even <em>more</em> powers and Fae artifacts (<a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/05/soul-taken/>Soul Taken</a>).</p><blockquote><p>With Mercy, everything that can be worse is. Always.</p></blockquote><p>Things have gotten so <em>big</em>, so it&rsquo;s nice to have what actually turns out to be a relatively self contained book in Winter Lost. For the most part, we have almost a closed house murder mystery. Just Mercy, Adam, and a handful of other wild and strange folk stuck at a lodge in a winter storm.</p><blockquote><p>She was staring at him.</p><p>“I could not live with losing you,” he told her, his throat tight. “There are times when I have had to let you go out into danger without me. More times when I haven’t known about threats to your life until they were long past. But this time… this time I have the privilege of being backup while you head out to see if we can rescue your brother.”</p></blockquote><p>I love the focus this brings the book. And it really does give the two a chance, I hope, to love and trust each other. Adam has got some severe baggage from those witches <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/31/storm-cursed/>a few books back</a> (plus all his other baggage I suppose) and Mercy has some serious wounds to deal with. This gives them that time. With a wild story that at once feels huge and world ending&ndash;and at the same time snug.</p><p>I love it.</p><p>We do also get a few fun peeks into what else is going on on the Mercyverse, primarily through flashbacks and asides told from a bunch of other points of view, which makes this structurally more interesting than any of the other books thus far.</p><p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to what comes next! (Although I&rsquo;m personally hoping for an <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/alpha-omega/>Alpha & Omega</a> book next! What the cliffhanger).</p><p>Onward!</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/07/06/turning-darkness-into-light/ class=clearfix>Turning Darkness Into Light</a>

But the stories we choose to tell—those matter. It’s important that the Anevrai told a story about harmony, that they went to the effort of writing it on finely made tablets with gold at their heart. Sacred tablets. That says it was an ideal. And even when we fall short of ideals, that doesn’t mean we should give up striving for them.</p></blockquote><p>And so, an extra book! We&rsquo;ve finished the main series that follows the eponymous Lady Trent, so now we get a book from the point of view of her granddaughter. On top of that, we&rsquo;re going full on epistolary format&ndash;it&rsquo;s told through diary entries, letters, and the text of in universe books.</p><p>It&rsquo;s an interesting style and I think it gives a lot to the book. It&rsquo;s also non-linear, but not egregiously so.</p><p>Overall, I think it&rsquo;s weaker than the first five Lady Trent books, but there&rsquo;s a bit more depth to the Draconean history we didn&rsquo;t quite get to in those books, which I appreciated. If that&rsquo;s something you were left wanting more of, go for it!</p><hr><p><a href=/2024/07/06/turning-darkness-into-light/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/07/05/the-city-of-brass/ class=clearfix>The City of Brass</a>

You get a touch of the Arabic world mixed with a straight up Arabic inspired fantasy world full of djinn in all manner of shapes and sizes&mldr; even at the end of the story, I&rsquo;m not actually 100% sure what all the differences are.</p><p>Characterwise, I&rsquo;m not sure I ever quite got around to liking Nahri. I was rooting for her before she took off, but I&rsquo;m not thrilled where she ended up.</p><blockquote><p>“You&rsquo;re some kind of thief, then?"<br>&ldquo;That a very narrow-minded way of looking at it. I prefer to think of myself as a merchant of delicate tasks.”</p></blockquote><p>Ali and Dara though, I quite like the both of them&ndash;surprisingly for roughly the same reasons. They are trying to do the &lsquo;right thing&rsquo;, just with rather opposing ways of going about that.</p><blockquote><p>“To keep walking a path between loyalty to your family and loyalty to what you know is right. One of these days, you’re going to have to make a choice.”</p></blockquote><p>Overall, I&rsquo;m looking forward to the second book.

The entire idea that Marguerite can&rsquo;t jump into the same world as Wicked and has to trail behind, digging herselves out of any trouble Wicked gets them into is fascinating.

I even want the worst of you because it’s <em>still a part of you</em>.</p></blockquote><p>Ten Thousand Skies Above You takes that idea and expands upon it in a fascinating way. Now, it&rsquo;s not just searching through the multiverse, it&rsquo;s the early stages of a war between realities. Once again, it&rsquo;s about saving a life, but this time, it&rsquo;s less a puzzle and more a scavenger hunt, with some <em>serious</em> repercussions if you don&rsquo;t find all of the pieces.</p><p>Other than a cliffhanger ending (we&rsquo;ll come back to that&mldr;), it&rsquo;s really quite a good sequel.
