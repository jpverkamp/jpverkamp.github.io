Now, in A Million Worlds with You, the fighting is <em>on</em>.</p><p>The core of the story comes in two parts:</p><p>For one, we have Marguerite chasing a twisted echo of herself (who she names Wicked; I do enjoy how everyone just goes with her names throughout the book). The entire idea that Marguerite can&rsquo;t jump into the same world as Wicked and has to trail behind, digging herselves out of any trouble Wicked gets them into is fascinating. But by itself, entirely reactive.</p><p>So for two, we have a war between dimensions. We have some worlds that were already aware of parallel realities, but now, finally, they are beginning to work together and push back against the Triad.</p><p>To war!</p><p>I do love the premise. It&rsquo;s solidly written and a worthwhile finish to the trilogy (although now I want more! what happens between all the worlds next?!). It &mldr; was rough to start it, mostly due to all the damage Marguerite and especially Paul went through last book, but that&rsquo;s sort of the the point.</p><p>Well worth the read.</p><p><a href=/2024/05/31/a-million-worlds-with-you/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/05/22/ten-thousand-skies-above-you/ class=clearfix>Ten Thousand Skies Above You</a>

Or perhaps even to fall in love.</p><blockquote><p>The multiverse is infinite. So, yeah, we go through some terrible things together, and I’ve seen versions of you who are darker, and damaged, and I don’t care. I want you even when you’re broken. I want you no matter what. Your darkness, your anger, whatever it is you fear inside yourself—it doesn’t matter. I love you completely, don’t you see? I even want the worst of you because it’s <em>still a part of you</em>.</p></blockquote><p>Ten Thousand Skies Above You takes that idea and expands upon it in a fascinating way. Now, it&rsquo;s not just searching through the multiverse, it&rsquo;s the early stages of a war between realities. Once again, it&rsquo;s about saving a life, but this time, it&rsquo;s less a puzzle and more a scavenger hunt, with some <em>serious</em> repercussions if you don&rsquo;t find all of the pieces.</p><p>Other than a cliffhanger ending (we&rsquo;ll come back to that&mldr;), it&rsquo;s really quite a good sequel. If anything, I think I enjoyed it even more than the first.</p><p><a href=/2024/05/22/ten-thousand-skies-above-you/>read more...</a></p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/05/20/the-mysterious-benedict-society-and-the-prisoners-dilemma/ class=clearfix>The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Prisoner's Dilemma</a>

I enjoyed it, but I think I&rsquo;ve been enjoying each book in the series a little less.</p><p>The first book, the kids were brilliant and that was the core of the story. They could think their way out of any wacky mystery they get into. Here, we have Constance literally reading minds and Reynie with his sixth sense for danger. Sticky with his perfect memory, reading just &mldr; everything in the house. Even Kate&rsquo;s magical bucket&ndash;nah, I still enjoy that one.</p><p>On the other hand, there was a lot of action and for the most part, the kids are still working their way out of trouble all by themselves&ndash;even when a rescue is under way&ndash;and I enjoyed that. The plot itself didn&rsquo;t go to quite as adventurous destinations as the first two, which I missed.</p><p>I still do really enjoy the found family aspects of the story on all levels. The kids themselves are great together and there are some really humorous points. And they&rsquo;re extended family all together, especially with Mr. Benedict, I really did enjoy that. They do get quite the sense of closure towards the end.</p><p>Although there&rsquo;s apparently a 4th and a prequel, I think it&rsquo;s time to move on to something else.</p><p>Onward!</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/05/18/in-the-labyrinth-of-drakes/ class=clearfix>In the Labyrinth of Drakes</a>

This time, as mentioned, to the deserts of Akhia.</p><p>The inciting incident this time is that the military is trying to breed dragons&ndash;either to harvest them for bones or train them for war&ndash;is interesting enough and sure to appeal to Isabella. The whole how do dragons breed / how did we get such variety has been a question for a long time now, and I&rsquo;m just as curious as Isabella is to dig into it.</p><p>Characterwise, it&rsquo;s a welcome delight to see Suhail again. I do quite enjoy seeing Isabella and Suhail&rsquo;s relationship develop and this book certainly doesn&rsquo;t slouch in that regard.</p><blockquote><p>I sometimes imagine there is a clerk behind a desk situated between the brain and the mouth. It is his job to examine utterances on their way out, and stamp them with approval or send them back for reconsideration. If such a clerk exists, mine must be very harried and overworked; and on occasion he puts his head down on the desk in despair, letting things pass without so much as a second glance.</p></blockquote><p>Oh they&rsquo;re fun.</p><p>I will admit, after actually getting Jake at least somewhat in <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/04/07/the-voyage-of-the-basilisk/>The Voyage of the Basilisk</a>, it&rsquo;s <em>weird</em> that he&rsquo;s just completely ignored again for the most part here.</p><blockquote><p>(Indeed, a female desert drake makes me look like a doting mother by comparison.)</p></blockquote><p>You&rsquo;re not wrong.</p><p>Overall, if you&rsquo;ve enjoyed the books up to now, you&rsquo;ll almost certainly enjoy this one.</p><p>Onward!</p><p>(And only one left!)</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/05/17/s.h.i.e.l.d.-volume-1-perfect-bullets/ class=clearfix>S.H.I.E.L.D., Volume 1: Perfect Bullets</a>

Jane has managed to take control of vampire world and solidify her power in and around New Orleans. We need something to shake up that new status quo, if the series isn&rsquo;t just going to end now. And really, there was foreshadowing that something like this might happen all the way back to the early books.</p><p>Still feels weird.</p><p>On the plus side, seeing the new evolution of an old character was great fun, I hope we get more of that! The battles were exciting and bloody, more of that! And seeing Jane well supported and loved is something that&rsquo;s she had a long time coming and well deserved.</p><p>On the flipside&mldr; I miss the smaller stakes (heh) of the older books.

I think Susan, growing and changing and coming to terms with her powers is really the heart of these stories and I&rsquo;m hoping for even more.</p><p>The worldbuilding remains fantastical in a way that Garth Nix is so good at. We have a wonderful blend of real world and an underlying magic, with ancient powers, magical artifcats, and statues coming to life.</p><p>Overall, I&rsquo;m surprised but pleasantly so that the Left-Handed Booksellers had a sequel.

But as these are reminders of what I liked in a book (and what even happened in a specific book), on we go anyways! 😄</p><blockquote><p>When the fiddle had stopped singing Laura called out softly, “What are days of auld lang syne, Pa?”<br>“They are the days of a long time ago, Laura,” Pa said. “Go to sleep, now.”<br>But Laura lay awake a little while, listening to Pa’s fiddle softly playing and to the lonely sound of the wind in the Big Woods. She looked at Pa sitting on the bench by the hearth, the firelight gleaming on his brown hair and beard and glistening on the honey-brown fiddle. She looked at Ma, gently rocking and knitting.<br>She thought to herself, “This is now.”<br>She was glad that the cosy house, and Pa and Ma and the firelight and the music, were now. They could not be forgotten, she thought, because now is now. It can never be a long time ago.</p></blockquote><p>These are the quasi-non-fictional stories of Laura Ingles Wilder, who grew up in the American frontier of the late 1800s. In this book, they start out in the titular Big Woods of Wisconsin, living a relatively simple life of farming and hunting.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a slice of life story as much as anything, detailing the lives of Laura and her family rather than following any overarching plot. That&rsquo;s just not how lives work. And having read a number of other (purely fictional) books in the genre, I appreciate it. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s just nice to live another life for a while, even if that life isn&rsquo;t alway pleasant in turn.</p><p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to see the little aspects of life. What&rsquo;s important to Laura and her family. The sugar snow and maple syrup are always big huts, but the delight in finding a honey tree, the brand new innovation of a threshing machine, and even all the little mentions of what they eat, it&rsquo;s all a window into &lsquo;days gone by&rsquo;.</p><p>Overall, I quite enjoy this book. It&rsquo;s weird knowing that it was life for Laura and her family&ndash;as it was for many people of that time. But in my opinion, worth a read.</p><p>Side note: I&rsquo;ve most often and most recently listened to the narration by Cherry Jones. She <em>is</em> the voice of these books and I do quite enjoy her narration. Worth a listen.</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/05/05/a-thousand-pieces-of-you/ class=clearfix>A Thousand Pieces of You</a>

Never doubt that.</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s one part jumping into parallel reality sci-fi, one part murder mystery, and one part YA adventure story (complete with love tangle).</p><p>For me at least, it works surprisingly well. I&rsquo;m normally not a huge fan of love tangles taking up a large part of a story. Here, I think it works pretty well. We have the additional tension of investigating murder. Plus having the feel of previously established relationships and growth throughout the story. It works.</p><p>Parallel reality / sci-fi wise, it&rsquo;s&mldr; light. There&rsquo;s not really much in the way of exactly <em>how</em> parallel realities work and what the rules are for moving from one to another. On the other hand, as a vehicle to jump from our world (ish) to a vaguely futuristic London. To one where Russian is still in it&rsquo;s full Czarist grandeur. To another where climate change has already flooded the world.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also interesting how on one hand you have the parallel reality &rsquo;everything is possible&rsquo;, contrasted throughout the entire book by:</p><blockquote><p>“There are patterns within the dimensions,” Paul insisted, never looking up again. “Mathematical parallels. It’s plausible to hypothesize that these patterns will be reflected in events and people in each dimension. That people who have met in one quantum reality will be likely to meet in another. Certain things that happen will happen over and over, in different ways, but more often than you could explain by chance alone.”</p><p>“In other words,” I said, “you’re trying to prove the existence of fate.”</p><p>I was joking, but Paul nodded slowly, like I’d said something intelligent. “Yes. That’s it exactly.”</p></blockquote><p>I feel like you can&rsquo;t really have it both ways&mldr; and the story doesn&rsquo;t really either. It&rsquo;s really just the latter.</p><p>Overall, I really enjoyed listening to this story. I&rsquo;m really curious where it goes from here.
