Jane has managed to take control of vampire world and solidify her power in and around New Orleans. We need something to shake up that new status quo, if the series isn&rsquo;t just going to end now.

I don&rsquo;t really understand why Jane became the Dark Queen (either from a personal perspective or a metaphysical one), beyond perhaps that there&rsquo;s no one else.

Merlin and Vivien are off doing magical things&mldr; and stumble into trouble, needing Susan to help them out.</p><p>I do love reading about the three of them. I think Susan, growing and changing and coming to terms with her powers is really the heart of these stories and I&rsquo;m hoping for even more.</p><p>The worldbuilding remains fantastical in a way that Garth Nix is so good at. We have a wonderful blend of real world and an underlying magic, with ancient powers, magical artifcats, and statues coming to life.</p><p>Overall, I&rsquo;m surprised but pleasantly so that the Left-Handed Booksellers had a sequel.

But as these are reminders of what I liked in a book (and what even happened in a specific book), on we go anyways! üòÑ</p><blockquote><p>When the fiddle had stopped singing Laura called out softly, ‚ÄúWhat are days of auld lang syne, Pa?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThey are the days of a long time ago, Laura,‚Äù Pa said. ‚ÄúGo to sleep, now.‚Äù<br>But Laura lay awake a little while, listening to Pa‚Äôs fiddle softly playing and to the lonely sound of the wind in the Big Woods. She looked at Pa sitting on the bench by the hearth, the firelight gleaming on his brown hair and beard and glistening on the honey-brown fiddle. She looked at Ma, gently rocking and knitting.<br>She thought to herself, ‚ÄúThis is now.‚Äù<br>She was glad that the cosy house, and Pa and Ma and the firelight and the music, were now. They could not be forgotten, she thought, because now is now. It can never be a long time ago.</p></blockquote><p>These are the quasi-non-fictional stories of Laura Ingles Wilder, who grew up in the American frontier of the late 1800s. In this book, they start out in the titular Big Woods of Wisconsin, living a relatively simple life of farming and hunting.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a slice of life story as much as anything, detailing the lives of Laura and her family rather than following any overarching plot. That&rsquo;s just not how lives work. And having read a number of other (purely fictional) books in the genre, I appreciate it. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s just nice to live another life for a while, even if that life isn&rsquo;t alway pleasant in turn.</p><p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to see the little aspects of life. What&rsquo;s important to Laura and her family. The sugar snow and maple syrup are always big huts, but the delight in finding a honey tree, the brand new innovation of a threshing machine, and even all the little mentions of what they eat, it&rsquo;s all a window into &lsquo;days gone by&rsquo;.</p><p>Overall, I quite enjoy this book. It&rsquo;s weird knowing that it was life for Laura and her family&ndash;as it was for many people of that time. But in my opinion, worth a read.</p><p>Side note: I&rsquo;ve most often and most recently listened to the narration by Cherry Jones. She <em>is</em> the voice of these books and I do quite enjoy her narration. Worth a listen.</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/05/05/a-thousand-pieces-of-you/ class=clearfix>A Thousand Pieces of You</a>

Never doubt that.</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s one part jumping into parallel reality sci-fi, one part murder mystery, and one part YA adventure story (complete with love tangle).</p><p>For me at least, it works surprisingly well. I&rsquo;m normally not a huge fan of love tangles taking up a large part of a story. Here, I think it works pretty well. We have the additional tension of investigating murder. Plus having the feel of previously established relationships and growth throughout the story. It works.</p><p>Parallel reality / sci-fi wise, it&rsquo;s&mldr; light. There&rsquo;s not really much in the way of exactly <em>how</em> parallel realities work and what the rules are for moving from one to another. On the other hand, as a vehicle to jump from our world (ish) to a vaguely futuristic London. To one where Russian is still in it&rsquo;s full Czarist grandeur. To another where climate change has already flooded the world.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also interesting how on one hand you have the parallel reality &rsquo;everything is possible&rsquo;, contrasted throughout the entire book by:</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúThere are patterns within the dimensions,‚Äù Paul insisted, never looking up again. ‚ÄúMathematical parallels. It‚Äôs plausible to hypothesize that these patterns will be reflected in events and people in each dimension. That people who have met in one quantum reality will be likely to meet in another. Certain things that happen will happen over and over, in different ways, but more often than you could explain by chance alone.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúIn other words,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre trying to prove the existence of fate.‚Äù</p><p>I was joking, but Paul nodded slowly, like I‚Äôd said something intelligent. ‚ÄúYes. That‚Äôs it exactly.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>I feel like you can&rsquo;t really have it both ways&mldr; and the story doesn&rsquo;t really either. It&rsquo;s really just the latter.</p><p>Overall, I really enjoyed listening to this story. I&rsquo;m really curious where it goes from here.

But somehow in there I managed to miss seeing the Left-Handed Booksellers of London.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a fun older, lighter style of urban fantasy, set in 1980s London. You have magical booksellers, a missing parent (who of course is going to be magical), and all manner of mysteries, beasties, and mysterious beasties. On top of that, some delightful side characters (Merlin St. Jacques is my favorite) and some magically described scenes.</p><blockquote><p>I think Merlin has explained to you that the mythic landscape is layered, and usually quite local. Entities and environments are generally confined to a particular geographic area and often also to particular times of day or night, phases of the moon, that sort of thing. Even weather, as with the things that come out after rain, or only when it snows. And they are bound by custom and lore to behave in certain ways, to do certain things, and of course these days are mostly dormant anyway.</p></blockquote><p>I enjoyed this book. It&rsquo;s not up to the level of <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/10/01/sabriel/>Sabriel</a> and it&rsquo;s sequels, but it was a fun read and I&rsquo;m glad to have found it.

Time travel at a small scale can be a lot of fun. It helps you pull off heists after all. And yet&mldr; when you try to make it significantly larger, you really have to deal with the question: how does time travel work in this universe?</p><p>Well&mldr; it&rsquo;s never <em>entirely</em> answered.
