<span class=index>#3</span></a></h1><div class=entry-meta><span class=entry-date>2024-12-31</span></div></header><div class=entry-content><blockquote><p>Luck is a fairy tale we use to make people feel better about the world being unfair as shit.</p></blockquote><p>Man this book has come a ways since <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/07/05/the-city-of-brass/>The City of Brass</a>. At first we had a fairly straight forward portal fantasy: normal human girl goes through a portal (ish) to another world, discovers magic, and has adventures (again; ish). Then things escalate. Political intrigue. Old enemies. Revolution. War.</p><p>And now&mldr; Daevabad has fallen. Nahri and Ali are on the run, trying desperately first to survive and then&mldr; maybe, to come back and save the day. And perhaps learn all those dirty little secrets those (formerly) in power tried hard to hide all these years.</p><blockquote><p>I do not believe ambitious men who say the only route to peace and prosperity lies in giving them more power—particularly when they do it with lands and people who are not theirs.</p></blockquote><p>I love the characters. Especially Dara, but the whole Nahri and Ali journey was great to read. And I even foundmyself rooting for Muntadhir, which after the previous books&mldr; I did not expect). Manizheh&mldr; I think Ghassan was a better villain overall, and it&rsquo;s interesting that she made it as far as she did, but so it goes.</p><p>And I still love the worldbuilding&ndash;even if I&rsquo;m <em>still after 3 books</em> not 100% sure what is a subset of what and who is a when. But I suppose that&rsquo;s the point. Reality is messy. But it&rsquo;s a fascinating world and I&rsquo;m sad to be leaving it.</p><p>Overall it&rsquo;s a solid conclusion to a great series. I&rsquo;d be happy to read more in this world, but I&rsquo;m always glad to see a series actually get it&rsquo;s own small end, rather than just fading out as many do.</p><blockquote><p>Find your happiness, little thief. Steal it and do not ever let it go.</p></blockquote><p>Onward!</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/30/iron-council/ class=clearfix>Iron Council</a>

It&rsquo;s about the tension of a revolution that feels inevitable. We have a story about gender differences (in a world where sexual dimorphism is a huge deal for some species) and love and longing. And a story about future history. The messy way of how one ends up getting history books written about them.</p><blockquote><p>“History&mldr;” Jacobs spoke with terse authority. Brought Ori to a hush. “Is all full. And dripping. With the corpses. Of them who trusted the incorruptible.”</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s also interesting to see the fallout of the &lsquo;Contruct Uprising&rsquo;. A direct consequence of <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/04/perdido-street-station/>Perdido Street Station</a>. And now instead, we have <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golems>golems</a>&ndash;which in this world can be made by animating any sorts of bits of innanimate matter and giving them life/instructions. It&rsquo;s cool!</p><p>Unfortunately, I think this may be the weakest of the three. Despite how cool an idea a &lsquo;perpetual train&rsquo; is, I think the story spends too much time on other people/places/things. It&rsquo;s all building up, but when one of the things I love the most (and always start by describing) is left wanting? That&rsquo;s a bit of a bummer. It&rsquo;s still fascinating and there&rsquo;s a bunch of it&mldr; but I wanted more!</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/29/whispers-under-ground/ class=clearfix>Whispers Under Ground</a>

The LONDON UNDERGROUND!</p><p>I do continue to really love the feel of these books. It <em>feels</em> like a British cop show with a combination of magical elements and the science of magic, which are all delightful things.</p><p>Characterwise, it&rsquo;s mostly the same, although this time around, we get a lot more of Lesley stepping up to learn magic again, which is something I was hoping would happen. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how those two grow together.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;That was Seawoll,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Stephanopoulos is on her way down and you’re not to do anything stupid until she gets here.&rdquo;</p><p>You burn down one central London tourist attraction, I thought, and they never let you forget it.</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s also interesting seeing the bits of London as a city built on people from all manners, histories, and walks of life.</p><blockquote><p>My mum translated this in her head to &ldquo;witchfinder,&rdquo; which was good because like most West Africans, she considered witchfinding a more respectable profession than policeman.</p></blockquote><p>😄</p><p>Worldbuildingwise, I like seeing ever more of teh magical world of London. There really is a feel of &rsquo;this <em>could</em> be&rsquo; that urban fantasy doesn&rsquo;t always get right. And I enjoy finding out that even the magical folks don&rsquo;t know how a lot of what they do works, but our main character is <em>not</em> going to let that stand.</p><blockquote><p>This is why magic is worse even than quantum physics. Because, while both spit in the eye of common sense, I&rsquo;ve never yet had a Higgs bosun turn up and try to have a conversation with me.</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s fun to see even more of the magical underground (literally). It&rsquo;s neat to see how different authors play with old stories (and make up their own!)</p><blockquote><p>“My dad was a fairy," said Zach. &ldquo;And by that I don&rsquo;t mean he dressed well and enjoyed musical theatre.”</p></blockquote><p>One oddity: There are a ton of Lord of the Rings references throughout this book, some blatent and some more subtle. I was really fully expecting that to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s%20gun>Chekhov's gun</a>&mldr; but they were just references all along? That seems weird to me and I can&rsquo;t quite my finger on why.</p><p>Overall, I loved it and am looking forward to the next one!

A three hour line at the local library where you&rsquo;ve run out of podcasts will do that to you. 😄 Mostly, the cover looked neat, so I figured I&rsquo;d give it a chance. Which makes this only the second physical (non-children&rsquo;s) book I&rsquo;ve read in probably a decade.</p><p>For better or (and) for worse, the book is billed as &lsquo;if <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/shirley-jackson/>Shirley Jackson</a> wrote The Shining&rsquo;, which&mldr; this is not. It does have a family moved out deep into the wilderness, away from the city they&rsquo;ve always loved, thrown into land where somehow you can get &mldr; feet of unexpected snow? And a tree that may or may not be talking to you?</p><p>Mostly, I think it feels not quite finished. There are some decently creepy scenes in the book, but it never quite ramped up for me. The hallucinations the family goes through are certainly disconcerting but, barring one, they don&rsquo;t really seem to be all that dangerous. I did like that it was never entirely clear what was hallucination and what was <em>real</em> though, that was a nice touch. Then, by the time things really start falling apart, we have sudden violence/death that doesn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> land and an ending that wrapped up all too suddenly.</p><p>I will say that I did enjoy the descriptions of the mountain wilderness and their new home. I would have liked to explore that more. It felt <em>wild</em>, which I appreciated.</p><p>Anyways, being only the second physical book I&rsquo;ve read in a <em>long</em> while and a hardcover at that, it really did have a nice tactile feel to it and I was enjoying the book enough to read it all the way through, so I&rsquo;ve certainly come across worse.</p><p>Onward!</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/28/moon-over-soho/ class=clearfix>Moon Over Soho</a>

He&rsquo;s doing <em>science</em> to <strong>magic</strong>. I do enjoy books that do that. (Plus, it&rsquo;s funny!)</p><blockquote><p>I had jokingly developed my own scale for vestigia based on the amount of noise Toby made when he interacted with any residual magic. I called it a yap, one yap being enough vestigia to be apparent even when I wasn&rsquo;t looking for it.</p><p>The yap would be an SI unit, of course, and thus the standard background ambience of a Central London pub was 0.2 of a yap (0.2Y) or 200 milliyaps (200mY).</p></blockquote><p>Also, more worldbuilding about what the &lsquo;Rivers&rsquo; are (fae? or at least fae adjacent). More talk about vampires. And of course&mldr; What&rsquo;s the <em>deal</em> with Nightingale?</p><blockquote><p>“What&rsquo;s the biggest thing you&rsquo;ve zapped with a fireball?&rsquo; I asked.<br>&lsquo;That would be a tiger,&lsquo;said Nightingale.<br>&lsquo;Well don&rsquo;t tell Greenpeace,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re an endagered species.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Not that sort of tiger,&rsquo; said Nightingale. &lsquo;A Panzer-kampfwagen sechs Ausf E.&rsquo;<br>I stared at him. &lsquo;You knocked out a Tiger tank with a fireball?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Actually I knocked out two,&rsquo; said Nightingale. &lsquo;I have to admit that the first one took three shots, one to disable the tracks, one through the driver&rsquo;s eye slot and one down the commander&rsquo;s hatch - brewed up rather nicely.”</p></blockquote><p>Plus, we get piles more London, this time around digging into the musical/jazz scenes. I managed to go through the first book entirely expecting Grant&rsquo;s parents to be out of the picture (that&rsquo;s just the way urban fantasy always seems to go), so it&rsquo;s fascinating to see them on page and actually playing interesting roles in the story!</p><blockquote><p>My Dad says that being a Londoner has nothing to do with where you&rsquo;re born. He says that there are people who get off a jumbo jet at Heathrow, go through immigration waving any kind of passport, hop on the tube and by the time the train&rsquo;s pulled into Piccadilly Circus they&rsquo;ve become a Londoner.</p></blockquote><p>Weirdest change of this series: Grant falls quickly and <em>deeply</em> in ~love~ lust with someone (from a case!) and there are a number of decently explicit on screen sex scenes. I didn&rsquo;t necessary see that one coming.</p><p>Also plotwise, I was &mldr; surprised by the ending. Not in who the big bad ended up being, more more what happened after that. It felt sudden and perhaps unearned, like we&rsquo;d reached the end of the book and had to warp things up. I&rsquo;m curious if we&rsquo;ll get any fallout of that in future books, but I don&rsquo;t really expect to.</p><p>I did really like the scenes with Leslie though (from the first book), especially&ndash;and counter to my first point&ndash;her ending. That&mldr; now <strong>that</strong> has some interesting potential for the series.</p></div><hr></article><article class=li><header><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/24/spider-gwen-vol.-4-predators/ class=clearfix>Spider-Gwen, Vol. 4: Predators</a>
