I easily beat my official goal of 50 with 84 books (finished the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/12/31/boundary-born/">last one&lt;/a>) a few hours before the end of the year). Unfortunately, it still feels like something of a failure, down from my &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/31/2015-reading-list-retrospective/">original 100 book year&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/12/31/2016-reading-list-retrospective/">last year&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> 91. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m just crazy enough that 84 books in a year feels like a failure. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few stats:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The shortest book I read this year was &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/19/the-eleventh-metal/">The Eleventh Metal&lt;/a> at 14 pages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The longest was &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/08/12/beyond-the-shadows/">Beyond the Shadows&lt;/a> at 689 pages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My overall average was 338 pages per book and 77 per day&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My average rating was 4.5 with 14 three stars and 18 four stars (the rest were fives)&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I listened to 21 books on audiobook (all Discworld novels, so that&amp;rsquo;s almost my most by a single author or in a single series)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I borrowed a good number of them from our local library system; &lt;a href="https://www.overdrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overdrive&lt;/a> is wonderful&lt;/li>

&lt;p>And now that you know this, are you any different than you were yesterday?” he asked. Pragmatic, as usual. “Nothing has changed, Lex. You haven’t changed. You just know something that you didn’t know before, that’s all.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>In this case, the idea is personified by the golems&amp;ndash;a constructed race of humanoids made of clay, animated by a religious text stored inside of their head, and bound to service (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired by Jewish folklore&lt;/a>). According to just about everyone, golems aren&amp;rsquo;t alive. They are nothing more than tools.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boundary Lines</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/12/17/boundary-lines/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/12/17/boundary-lines/</guid><description>&lt;p>After getting tossed into the world of the supernatural in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/11/27/boundary-crossed/">Boundary Crossed&lt;/a>, Lex is back and starting to learn just why everyone seems to be out to get her in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/12/17/boundary-lines/">Boundary Lines&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Someone is stirring up local magic, brining back magical beasties from an age long gone and driving the (semi-)local werewolf mad. We get a good amount of world building, learning a fair bit more about the werewolves and finally seeing a second boundary mage&amp;ndash;even if she died a long time ago. We get a bit more characterization of the other witches and vampires, a bit more on the local politics and tensions between the various supernatural factions. Neat worldbuilding all around and a few decent plot twists.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Men at Arms</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/12/13/men-at-arms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/12/13/men-at-arms/</guid><description>&lt;p>Continuing the story of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/09/12/guards-guards/">Guards!

&lt;p>For security reasons, no books will be permitted in the chamber during your testimony.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Revisionary is a fascinating work. It takes the world building of the first three [Magic Ex Libris](&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/67567-magic-ex-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.goodreads.com/series/67567-magic-ex-&lt;/a> libris) books and explores what happens when magic comes out in the modern world. It&amp;rsquo;s probably the best example I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of this, right up there with the [Mercy Thompson books](&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40932-mercy-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.goodreads.com/series/40932-mercy-&lt;/a> thompson) (and honestly does a better job of showing the changes from the point of view of humans dragged into a new world).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boundary Crossed</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/11/27/boundary-crossed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/11/27/boundary-crossed/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>I’ve been lied to a lot, lately. And some of it’s been with the truth.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Broken Souls follows up the craziness that was Dead Things and turns the dial up yet again. We get some fascinating worldbuilding, expanding both the series&amp;rsquo; view of necromancy and the dead and the Aztec side of Santa Muerte.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dead Things</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/11/20/dead-things/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/11/20/dead-things/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>One one hand, the interplanetary and interpersonal conflicts we say growing through the last book or two come to a head here, with space battles large and small, culminating in a lot of destruction and a fascinating yet completely mysterious final battle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unbound</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/11/11/unbound/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/11/11/unbound/</guid><description>&lt;p>And we&amp;rsquo;re back. This time around, things are getting really serious with Meridiana, the queen of the Ghost Army wrecking havoc in the modern world. It&amp;rsquo;s an excellent story, much tighter than the previous two. It&amp;rsquo;s also rather more serious in tone, although there are still piles of jokes and references to other books to go around.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>As was often the case, magic just chuckled and kicked physics in the balls, leaving it groaning and wondering what just happened.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>Nemesis Games</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/10/30/nemesis-games/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/10/30/nemesis-games/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You can tell you’ve found a really interesting question when nobody wants you to answer it.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, while the first novels in the Expanse series asked a whole pile of interesting questions about the Protomolecule and the gate builders&amp;hellip; both seem almost entirely absent in Nemesis Games.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Codex Born</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/10/21/codex-born/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/10/21/codex-born/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“My name is Isaac Vainio,” I said. “You smashed my library. Prepare to die.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This time around, the stakes are higher. We learn a bit more about the history of magic in the world and Libriomancy in particular, including a way that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require Gutenberg&amp;rsquo;s presses to come into being, which isn&amp;rsquo;t something I had even considered. On top of that, we get some technomancy, more looks at the big nasties that live in books, and a big magical showdown.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guards!

Guards!&lt;/em> in particular. It&amp;rsquo;s hilarious.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>They may be called the Palace Guard, the City Guard, or the Patrol. Whatever the name, their purpose in any work of heroic fantasy is identical: it is, round about Chapter Three (or ten minutes into the film) to rush into the room, attack the hero one at a time, and be slaughtered. No one ever asks them if they want to. This book is dedicated to those fine men.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>Abaddon's Gate</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/09/09/abaddons-gate/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/09/09/abaddons-gate/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Holden was starting to feel like they were all monkeys playing with a microwave. Push a button, a light comes on inside, so it’s a light. Push a different button and stick your hand inside, it burns you, so it’s a weapon. Learn to open and close the door, it’s a place to hide things. Never grasping what it actually did, and maybe not even having the framework necessary to figure it out. No monkey ever reheated a frozen burrito.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In the first book, the protomolecule made zombies. In the second, it made a Venuscomputer and super soldiers. This time around? A wormhole gate to transit hub in what looks to be a pocket universe where the laws of physics are&amp;hellip; flexible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Libriomancer</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/09/07/libriomancer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/09/07/libriomancer/</guid><description>&lt;p>Libriomancer has a lovely premise. Basically, books are magical. The more people you&amp;rsquo;ve had that have read the same edition of a given book, the more possible it is to magically pull various objections out of said book. Gutenberg took this principal with his first Bibles and founded an organization of Libriomancers that have existed up to the present day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love how many different ways Hines finds to use objects from various books (many I&amp;rsquo;ve read or at least heard of):&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pyramids</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/09/04/pyramids/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/09/04/pyramids/</guid><description>&lt;p>Pyramids is essentially Discworld versus Ancient Egypt. The entire idea of a kingdom that has been stable for so long that they do everything because they always have combined with the idea of spending basically everything on giant pyramids for the dead. Throw in some reality unstability, some worldbuilding on the Assassin&amp;rsquo;s guild,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worldbuildingwise, pyramids on the Discworld have this tendency to store time. Each king must have the greatest pyramid of all time. This time around, the pyramid is so big that reality gets a bit broken, sending the kingdom of Djelibeybi into a parallel reality where beliefs become reality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thief of Time</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/08/31/thief-of-time/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/08/31/thief-of-time/</guid><description>&lt;p>A slightly shorter entry into the Discworld universe and the last of the Death subseries, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get into Thief of Time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some interesting ideas in there. The fifth horseman of the apocalypse. Mrs. War. The Auditors (again) trying to simplify their jobs. The personification of Time. A clock that can keep &amp;lsquo;perfect&amp;rsquo; time and the trouble that would cause. History monks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hogfather</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/08/29/hogfather/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/08/29/hogfather/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Humans need fantasy to be human. To be the place where the falling angel meets the rising ape.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Short version: the Hog Father (twisted Santa Clause) is missing, extra belief is sloshing about causing all sorts of trouble, and Death has stepped up to fill the roll.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Caliban's War</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/08/22/calibans-war/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/08/22/calibans-war/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It’s not healthy having God sleeping right there where we can all watch him dream.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>After the events of Leviathan Wakes, the protomolecule is just hanging on doing strange things on Venus&amp;hellip; or is it?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beyond the Shadows</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/08/12/beyond-the-shadows/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/08/12/beyond-the-shadows/</guid><description>&lt;p>On one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s over. It&amp;rsquo;s a solid series with a lot of interesting world building that kept me turning pages right up to the end and managed to wrap up a surprising number of plotlines up into a huge final battle. If that&amp;rsquo;s all you&amp;rsquo;re looking for and you&amp;rsquo;ve already read the first two books, go ahead and read this one. It&amp;rsquo;s the first two books, only bigger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, I still don&amp;rsquo;t like Kylar. He&amp;rsquo;s too powerful almost without ill effect (other than the cost that finally gets revealed for coming back from the dead; that was a well deserved punch to the gut).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Leviathan Wakes</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/08/05/leviathan-wakes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/08/05/leviathan-wakes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Structurally, Leviathan Wakes is an interesting novel. It&amp;rsquo;s science fiction / space opera but also has fairly strong threads of crime novel / horror / military scifi threading through it as well. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting mix and done well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, we follow Holden and Miller. Holden is initially second in command on an ice trawler who cares about people to a fault. He wants people to know the truth, even if doing so might cause even more problems than it solves. Miller on the other hand is an older cop on a space station. He&amp;rsquo;s had a hard life among the more criminal elements of society which leaves him with a somewhat less rosy opinion on humanity. The contrast between the two of them drives the story, especially as things really start going wrong.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nothing Left to Lose</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/08/02/nothing-left-to-lose/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/08/02/nothing-left-to-lose/</guid><description>&lt;p>John is down to the last few Withered and he&amp;rsquo;s got a lead. One thing leads to another and he ends up in another small midwestern town, working at a mortuary. Sound familiar? It&amp;rsquo;s a nice blend of old and new and works well as a conclusion for the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eventually, the FBI show up and help to wrap up that storyline through the previous three books. We meet a handful of new Withered (including some surprising new powers) and get a bit more backstory. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t explain as much as I still want to know, but it&amp;rsquo;s more at least.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Over Your Dead Body</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/07/31/over-your-dead-body/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/07/31/over-your-dead-body/</guid><description>&lt;p>Following the disastrous ending of The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Only Friend, John and Brooke are out hunting Withered on their own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of John&amp;rsquo;s sociopathy in the previous four books, we now have Brooke with a supernatural cousin of multiple personality disorder as she has to deal with the fallout of ten thousand years of Nobody&amp;rsquo;s memories and suicides. It&amp;rsquo;s also interesting to watch John try to figure out how to deal with this, both as a source of information in his hunt against the Withered but also as Brooke&amp;rsquo;s friend.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Devil's Only Friend</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/07/25/the-devils-only-friend/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/07/25/the-devils-only-friend/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;em>The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Only Friend&lt;/em> , John Cleaver is at it again. As I hoped, the story has moved away from Clayton County. This time around, John and Brooke&amp;ndash; now with many of the memories and personalities of the demon (Cursed/Withered) Nobody&amp;ndash;are part of an FBI task force tasked with hunting down and killing as many of the demons as they can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a cool way to take the story and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see the change. I like seeing how John interacts with his new team members. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that they&amp;rsquo;re all screwed up in their own ways, but they&amp;rsquo;re still trying to hunt something even worse. I wish we&amp;rsquo;d gotten a bit more depth on them before the end of the book, but it&amp;rsquo;s still a new situation to see John react to.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Next of Kin</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/07/24/next-of-kin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/07/24/next-of-kin/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>So at the end of Mr. Monster, John literally called up a demon and told them to bring it on.

&lt;p>“My favorite part of family togetherness is when we aspirate body cavities. What’s yours?”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Mr. Monster takes basically everything that was in I Am Not a Serial Killer and cranks it up another notch. Creepy supernatural serial killer? Check. Long detailed descriptions of embalming? Check. John trying and sort of succeeding in coming to terms with being a sociopath?

&lt;p>I first heard about the John Cleaver books while listening to the &lt;a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Writing Excuses&lt;/a> podcast, which gave me a fairly good idea what I was getting into before I started it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Soul Music</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/27/soul-music/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/27/soul-music/</guid><description>&lt;p>Soul Music fell somewhat flat for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One one hand a Death story that only barely involves Death&amp;ndash;although the parts that do are pretty amusing. It&amp;rsquo;s yet another story of Death stepping down, this time getting temporarily replaced by his granddaughter of sorts, who just doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem that interesting to me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Arcanum Unbounded</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/25/arcanum-unbounded/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/25/arcanum-unbounded/</guid><description>&lt;p>Arcanum Unbounded collects a small pile of short stories all set in Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s shared universe (the Cosmere) and glues them together with some extra information about each world and about how the Cosmere itself works. While each of the stories is good by itself, they really shine collected together, where you get a sense of just how big and diverse this universe that Sanderson is building is.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a creepy short (for Sanderson) that follows an older woman (probably middle aged). She&amp;rsquo;s a mother, an inn-keeper, and a bounty hunter. She&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful character and really does do a lot to sell the story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sixth of the Dusk</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/24/sixth-of-the-dusk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/24/sixth-of-the-dusk/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve previously listened about this story on the &lt;a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Writing Excuses&lt;/a> podcast and read it in the [Shadows Beneath](&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21844946-shadows-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21844946-shadows-&lt;/a> beneath?from_search=true) anthology, but it&amp;rsquo;s just as weird/good now as it was then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worldbuildingwise, the idea of an ocean culture that travels between terrifying islands (with just as terrifying beasties in the water) is fascinating. Sentient birds ( &lt;span class="spoiler">/ worms&lt;/span>
 ) that people can tame and carry with them to grant them special powers? Yes please.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Secret History</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/23/secret-history/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/23/secret-history/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Oh, hell,” Kelsier said. “There’s actually a God?” “Yes.” Kelsier decked him.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve read the Mistborn series, read Secret History. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t, read the Mistborn series, then read Secret History. It&amp;rsquo;s worth the read just for for the the crazy intertwined universe-building that Sanderson has been pulling off for years now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shadow's Edge</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/23/shadows-edge/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/23/shadows-edge/</guid><description>&lt;p>Taken as a whole, Shadow&amp;rsquo;s Edge takes everything (the good and the bad) of the first Night Angel book and cranks it up even further. On the plus side, the good becomes even better. It was hard to put this book down. On the down side, a lot of the first part of the book where Kylar tries to run from his powers and live a normal life is honestly fairly boring. Luckily it picks back up and really goes crazy by the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are storylines all over the place. The all manage to tie together more or less, so I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly mind, but there are a few that I feel probably could have been cut to make a tighter story. Kylar&amp;rsquo;s story is interesting, obviously enough, as is that of Vi and the Godking. Sister Ariel&amp;rsquo;s story I feel could actually carry a story of its own and directly relates to the others. Logan&amp;rsquo;s time in the Hole is fascinating, but seemed to drag on forever (which I guess could have been intentional). But the storyline about the prostitute&amp;rsquo;s rebellion? All that about the Ubersword of DESTINY? I trust that eventually they&amp;rsquo;ll pay off. But within the context of this single story, the feel weird.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Allomancer Jak and the Pits of Eltania</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/21/allomancer-jak-and-the-pits-of-eltania/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/21/allomancer-jak-and-the-pits-of-eltania/</guid><description>&lt;p>Allomancer Jak is a hilarious, pulpy, over the top adventure story set on the Mistborn universe (specifically the Alloy of Law time period).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It adds a bit of world building&amp;ndash;specifically explaining how the Koloss have changed since the first era of the Final Empire&amp;ndash;but mostly it&amp;rsquo;s just fun to read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Eleventh Metal</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/19/the-eleventh-metal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/19/the-eleventh-metal/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Eleventh Metal is a short story originally written for the Mistborn Adventure Game (an RPG) that takes place before the events of the first Mistborn book. It gives us a bit more backstory about Kelsier and actually shows his own training, which is interesting enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s not bad. It&amp;rsquo;s just very short and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really add anything in particular to the rest of the Mistborn stories.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hope of Elantris</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/18/the-hope-of-elantris/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/18/the-hope-of-elantris/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a cute little side story set during the climactic final scenes of the main Elantris storyline. Basically, it&amp;rsquo;s a story that Sanderson had originally in mind for Elantris but cut due to pacing or other issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, it follows Matisse, an Elantrian who is charged with watching after the children and ends up saving them all with the help of Ashe the Seon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Orbital Decay</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/12/orbital-decay/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/12/orbital-decay/</guid><description>&lt;p>This took me a while to get through. It&amp;rsquo;s not because it&amp;rsquo;s bad, more like it just feels a bit dated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, it&amp;rsquo;s a circa 1990 story about just how boring life as a glorified construction worker in space could be. Basically, if you&amp;rsquo;re into hard science fiction that doesn&amp;rsquo;t glamorize space and all that involves, this could be your book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reaper Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/12/reaper-man/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/12/reaper-man/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>No one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away—until the clock wound up winds down, until the wine she made has finished its ferment, until the crop they planted is harvested. The span of someone’s life is only the core of their actual existence.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

But as the story wears on, and the details of the magic system are revealed, it becomes more obvious that the worlds are one and the same. I really do love how Sanderson does magic systems. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anything quite like it, especially not at the same scale. Every system seems new, yet there&amp;rsquo;s a shared core to all of them. I love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than that, I did like the character of Shai. There&amp;rsquo;s something about an artist who works entirely to know that she did it, rather than for public acclaim that I enjoy. Sneaky and subtle. Excellent. I could see a few of the twists coming (that she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t escape until the last moment; the changes she made), but that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it any less enjoyable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mort</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/05/mort/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/05/mort/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

That was a book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, you&amp;rsquo;re sort of tossed into the world and it takes rather a while to really figure out what was going on.

In that way, it&amp;rsquo;s very similar to the first of the Rama series (actually published 3 years later; ). It&amp;rsquo;s light on plot and characterization, instead opting to spend much of the novel on the titular Ringworld itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The technology of the Ringworld itself is interesting, although a decent amount of exactly how it works and its long history are left out. Essentially, take all of the planets and other objects in several solar system and turn them into a ring roughly 1 AU in radius. Spin it fast enough that you get fake gravity by way of centrifugal motion, add overhead plates to block sunlight into a fake day/night cycle, and add some plants. Bam Ringworld.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Last Guardian</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/05/01/the-last-guardian/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/05/01/the-last-guardian/</guid><description>&lt;p>So. Opal Koboi is back and she&amp;rsquo;s trying once again to rule/end the world (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure she knows the difference any more).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The basic idea of Koboi ordering her younger self killed in order to set up a paradox / magical explosion&amp;hellip; just to steal that energy and use it to activate some ancient Fairy doomsday spell?
