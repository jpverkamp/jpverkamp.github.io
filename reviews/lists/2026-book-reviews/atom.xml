&lt;p&gt;Aaaaaah!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Bear and the Nightingale</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2026/01/11/the-bear-and-the-nightingale/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2026/01/11/the-bear-and-the-nightingale/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All my life,” she said, “I have been told ‘go’ and ‘come.’ I am told how I will live, and I am told how I must die. I must be a man’s servant and a mare for his pleasure, or I must hide myself behind walls and surrender my flesh to a cold, silent god. I would walk into the jaws of hell itself, if it were a path of my own choosing. I would rather die tomorrow in the forest than live a hundred years of the life appointed me. Please. Please let me help you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bear and the Nightingale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, what happens if you take a Russian fairy tale and expand it to the full length of a novel while still managing to keep both the whimsical magical aspects&amp;hellip; and all the dark bits as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We go through years, watching as our main character Vasya is born (and her mother dies), up through when she&amp;rsquo;s a teenager on the cusp of being married off&amp;ndash;or sent to a monastery. She never quite fits in and makes for a wonderful point of view into this wordl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we see Russia &amp;lsquo;growing up&amp;rsquo; as well, abandoning the old gods and spirits of the forest in favor of the Church. It&amp;rsquo;s not the only conflict of the story (or, I&amp;rsquo;d argue, even the main one), but it does underlie the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing changes, Vasya. Things are, or they are not. Magic is forgetting that something ever was other than as you willed it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a delightful, haunting sort of story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: I did not realize this was a trilogy until writing this review! More to read!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Brian's Hunt</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2026/01/09/brians-hunt/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2026/01/09/brians-hunt/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Basically, this is &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2026/01/08/brians-return/"&gt;Brian’s Return&lt;/a&gt; part 2. Where he actually finishes the trip he set off on&amp;ndash;and somehow by &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; the most tragic of the five books. It&amp;rsquo;s a major tonal shift and there isn&amp;rsquo;t really any time to recover from it before the book is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get it, nature is rough sometimes. People die. But these books always had the sense of &amp;rsquo;no matter how bad it gets, you know (because it&amp;rsquo;s a book), nothing truly terrible will happen to Brian&amp;rsquo;. If that sounds great to you, consider skipping this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, we have the first hint of Brian as teenage boy with teenage boy thoughts&amp;ndash;but there just isn&amp;rsquo;t time to get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we have more hunting&amp;ndash;again, little enough time to get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, you can stop after book 1 or 3, in my opinion. So it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there ever happened to be a sixth book, I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to see the story finished, but apparently (on looking it up), Gary Paulsen passed away in 2021. Such is life. I do wonder about his other works though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Gate of the Feral Gods</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2026/01/09/the-gate-of-the-feral-gods/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2026/01/09/the-gate-of-the-feral-gods/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since that first monkey looked up into the sky and saw something twinkling up there, you meat puppets have tried to force twenty pounds of existential meaning into a ten pound sack of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy crap things just keep escalating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have another single level this time. Bubbles in space, each populated by a subset of crawlers that can&amp;rsquo;t (initially) interact, and each of which separated into air/earth/water/underground sections with their own puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course by the end Carl has done an excellent job of not being broken (more or less), saved people, killed even more people, and managed to summon and/or fight entirely too many (feral) gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know what, Carl? I’ve decided something,” Donut said, finally speaking. She released Mongo, who squawked and started investigating this strange, new world. “Yeah, Donut?” “I think they’re right about you. I think you’re crazy. Like, not a little weird crazy. Not guy who eats cereal without milk crazy. But crazy, crazy. Straitjacket crazy.” I took the cat into my lap, and then I pulled her to my chest. She purred heavily into my ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man that ending hits hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now&amp;hellip; based on the afterward, we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; going to have some complications next book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Brian's Return</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2026/01/08/brians-return/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2026/01/08/brians-return/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian sat quietly, taken by a peace he had not known for a long time, and let the canoe drift forward along the lily pads. To his right was the shoreline of a small lake he had flown into an hour earlier. Around him was the lake itself, an almost circular body of water of approximately eighty acres surrounded by northern forest&amp;ndash;pine, spruce, popular, and birch&amp;ndash;and thick brush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian is back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple years, Brian doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be doing overly well adapting back to &amp;lsquo;regular life&amp;rsquo;. So he ends up going back to the wilderness, this time at least with a few more supplies. It&amp;rsquo;s another trip on a river (this time with a canoe) with a bunch more hunting and arrow building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, it ends before it really starts and I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure what the point of this one is compared to the two. We don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; get into Brian&amp;rsquo;s headspace going back. So it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is amusing that he takes Shakespeare with him this time around though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the final book about Brian, though someday I may do a nonfiction book about those parts of my life that were like Brian&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;doubt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Brian's Winter</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2026/01/04/brians-winter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2026/01/04/brians-winter/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fall came on with a softness, so that Brian didn’t realize what was in store—a hard-spined north woods winter—until it was nearly too late.He had never thought he would be here this long. After the plane crash that marooned him in the wilderness he had lived day by day for fifty-four days, until he had found the survival pack in the plane. Then another thirty-five days through the northern summer, somehow living the same day-to-day pattern he had started just after the crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically, &amp;lsquo;what if Brian&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;wasn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; rescued at the end of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/12/22/hatchet/"&gt;Hatchet&lt;/a&gt; (and thus &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/12/29/the-river/"&gt;The River&lt;/a&gt; also doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen). He still gets the survival pack from the plane, but no radio for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it goes&amp;hellip; about as you&amp;rsquo;d expect? It&amp;rsquo;s very cold, but he figures out skins and furs. He does improve on his hunting supplies and learns more nature stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, it&amp;rsquo;s more of the same, which honestly is okay. I liked it more than &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/12/29/the-river/"&gt;The River&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Grimoire Grammar School Parent Teacher Association</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2026/01/04/the-grimoire-grammar-school-parent-teacher-association/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2026/01/04/the-grimoire-grammar-school-parent-teacher-association/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;See? She&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. Evander&amp;rsquo;s charming with animals, he nad half the birds in the neighborhood following him around by the time he was three. C&amp;rsquo;mon, you need to hit the wine and cheese table. And maybe skip the cheese.&amp;rdquo; Moira grabbed her arm and steered her around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; basically we have a mundane couple whose daughter is attacked (and thus turned) by a werewolf. Suddenly, they&amp;rsquo;re thrust into the magical world alongside our own, complete with kindergarten, children&amp;rsquo;s sports, marriage woes, talent shows, and PTAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just while everyone around is magical in someways, it&amp;rsquo;s at times humorous and at times entirely too on the nose combination of magic and mundane that really sets this off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You cast an invisibility spell?&amp;rdquo; Steve and his wife exchanged the classic &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;re in for it now&amp;rdquo; look every pair of parents perfects.
&amp;ldquo;I just did what Daddy does when he&amp;rsquo;s eating Mommy&amp;rsquo;s chips,&amp;rdquo; the boy said guilelessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh I do love the tone of this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivian and Daniel exchanged a glance. &amp;ldquo;Uh,&amp;rdquo; Daniel said when the silence had become a hair too long, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know what skirmedge is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a little like soccer. There&amp;rsquo;s a ball, although the ball transforms, and depending on if it&amp;rsquo;s in sphera or avis form, you can either hit it or catch it, until more than half the team crosses the patriam line—&amp;rdquo; Steve said, enthusiastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s wizard soccer,&amp;rdquo; Madhuri cut him off as she looked up from her phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, like-&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nope, don&amp;rsquo;t say it,&amp;rdquo; she warned them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were heading for the illusionist&amp;rsquo;s table, where the kids were getting adorned with butterfly wings that opened and closed, and little spaceships that orbited their shoulders, or copyrighted cartoon character heads overlaid on top of their real ones. To think that at last year&amp;rsquo;s party for Aria, Vivian had bought a face painting kit and had been proud when she&amp;rsquo;d turned out a half-decent cheek rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magical birthday parties yo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and as a side note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

Get your PJs ready! The last Friday before Winter Solstice is Cozy Day. Younger students may even bring a stuffed friend with them! (Note: stuffed friends must be inanimate.) Also, last chance to contribute to the Teachers Appreciation Fund! Last year&amp;rsquo;s blood donations were accepted in the spirit in which they were given, but we respectfully request that contributions be in a currency this year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the chapter intros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just an all around fun book, with enough series parts to really set off the humor and enough fun world building without getting bogged down. I do wish I could stay in this world just a bit longer, but for what it is, it was a great book to start the new year off with.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
