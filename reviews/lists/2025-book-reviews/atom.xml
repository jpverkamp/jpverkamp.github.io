&lt;p>Suppose the proverbial &amp;ldquo;greatest book of all time&amp;rdquo; is The Bible (and/or the Quran?). These collections contain a series of sometimes random, rambling stories, yet they all reinforce a key overarching theme. Debates continue as to whether The Bible is pure fact—a series of &amp;ldquo;memoirs&amp;rdquo; documenting events around that central theme—or fictionalized to reinforce the same message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Harry Potter, by many accounts, comes in second as one of the greatest books ever written. There’s no debate about this one; it was crafted purely as a work of fiction. But again, it’s a series of stories that follow close friends as they navigate their life journeys.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That &amp;hellip; is quite a book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s a memior of Andrew Verkamp&amp;ndash;a boy who &lt;del>grew&lt;/del> threw up in rural southern Indiana. And to read it, it&amp;rsquo;s honestly a bit of a surprise he made it this far. From a runaway chainsaw to a cabin in the woods, from childhood drinking to biting a head off a turkey. And that&amp;rsquo;s just the beginning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many of these stories will translate well if you didn&amp;rsquo;t grow up in that particular time and place, but at the very least it&amp;rsquo;s just like a train crash&amp;ndash;in all the best ways. You know, for some reason, that you perhaps shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be enjoying this quite so much&amp;ndash;but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to look away.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>EDITOR&amp;rsquo;S NOTE: I assume any legal implications from that evening have long since exceeded the statute of limitations, and this public confession has no legal basis. If it does, just forget I said anything. It was a snowy night, and obviously, I was safe at home cuddled up in bed that night (just ask Mom and Dad). That&amp;rsquo;s the story, and I am sticking to it.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>On the other, it&amp;rsquo;s the story of Kyana Woodstock&amp;ndash;25 years of a local mirror of that famous concert now itself more than half a century gone. Growing from a TV in the backyard to a 30&amp;rsquo;+ screen, hundreds of guests, live music, and entirely too many fireworks to a professional venue with licensing fees, insurance worries, and seats for 1500.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s structurally a strange book, taking half the time to even get to the title&amp;rsquo;s point. It&amp;rsquo;s a touch &amp;lsquo;stream of consciousness&amp;rsquo; at times and you&amp;rsquo;re never quite sure where (or when) the next story is going to take you.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t your average blah, blah, blah book. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s a random &amp;ldquo;kamikaze&amp;rdquo; style of seemingly unrelated &amp;ldquo;pukes&amp;rdquo; of brain thoughts, all weaving into a &amp;lsquo;sorta&amp;rsquo; seamless collection of recollections. Four books in one.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But oh, is it a ride alone the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disclaimer: You might be able to guess from author&amp;rsquo;s name (and the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em>in the book&lt;/em>) that this is my father. I also helped a bit to edit the book and read an earlier version before this one. Heck, I even wrote one of the chapters (apparently). So take this all with a &lt;del>grain&lt;/del> heaping spoonful of salt. But like I said&amp;ndash;once you get start, it&amp;rsquo;s a hard book to put down.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Starship's Mage</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/10/14/starships-mage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/10/14/starships-mage/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This place is always awe-inspiring to me,” Jenna said quietly from the edge of the room, and Damien glanced up from the impossibly perfect model of the ship to look at her. “I don’t understand any of how what you do works, but this room…this is the key to the stars.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“That was the Compact,” Damien half-whispered, reveling in the power pulsing around him. “Peace between Mage and Mundane, between Mars and Earth…and in exchange, we gave you the stars.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>On one hand, Starship&amp;rsquo;s Mage is (surprisingly?) hard sci fi. You have starship&amp;rsquo;s dealing with spin induced gravity, limits on acceleration so as not to crush your crew, and no&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> faster than light communication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, you have magic.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Um, sir, what is that plaque supposed to do?” he asked, intentionally changing the subject.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“It’s a security spell,” the Captain explained, seizing on the topic change. “It detects if anyone enters the office with hostile intent.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Damien traced the flow of energy through the runes and shook his head again. “You might want to have your senior Mage look at it,” he told the Captain. “The scribe used future imperative tenses instead of future-probabilistic. It’s actually slightly encouraging the chance of violence, not predicting it.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s laced throughout the story in a relatively light way&amp;ndash;especially considering that one of the main characters &lt;em>is&lt;/em> a mage. But right where it counts? In the ability to actually &lt;em>travel&lt;/em> faster than light? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s where magic comes into play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a weirdly fascinating idea and makes me want more of it. Just how many hijinks can you get up to, mixing scifi and fantasy?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Storywise, it&amp;rsquo;s quite the adventure, starting with pirates and a crew on the run and only escalating from there. The final three way chase/showdown is quite spectacular&amp;ndash;only to drop one heck of a cliffhanger. It&amp;rsquo;s the sort that you could leave off and (mostly) have a solid standalone book, but at the same time leaves you wanting more. Which I &lt;em>do&lt;/em> appreciate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One gotcha that at first I thought I was going to be annoyed about was the idea that Damien was a special/one of a kind/chosen one mage. He could do things no other mage could do. I won&amp;rsquo;t go too far into it&amp;ndash;spoilers!&amp;ndash;but suffice it to say that he&amp;rsquo;s not the only &amp;lsquo;impossible&amp;rsquo; thing in this universe&amp;hellip; and the sequels promise more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a fun story with some fascinating world building. And it&amp;rsquo;s for that alone that I want to read more. It turns out that there are already 18 books in this series (with another &lt;em>60&lt;/em> from the other over the last decade and change). So we&amp;rsquo;ll have to see where it goes next!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Demons of Good and Evil</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/10/09/demons-of-good-and-evil/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/10/09/demons-of-good-and-evil/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s amusing. We went right from her birthday to his in just a few books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now we have to deal with the fallout&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> of not only Hodin but also that werewolf cursed idol from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/19/a-fistful-of-charms/">oh so long ago&lt;/a>. And the return of that &lt;em>other&lt;/em> demon born witch&amp;ndash;Lee. Remember when Rachel sold him out to Al to save her own skin? And also (again) vampire politics and weres. And Trent&amp;rsquo;s elf politics and daughters. And Al&amp;rsquo;s part versus Hodin last book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, what a complicated life they weave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, another solid adventure! And oh man does the fall out of this book hit hard for some reason. I do enjoy a book where you realize it&amp;rsquo;s possible that some characters might die (even if &lt;em>generally&lt;/em> not main characters (&lt;em>cough&lt;/em> Kistin &lt;em>cough&lt;/em>)), but oy does it hurt sometimes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thought (since it&amp;rsquo;s been on my mind): this is yet another book where &amp;rsquo;never killing&amp;rsquo; versus Rachel&amp;rsquo;s more &amp;lsquo;creative&amp;rsquo; solutions comes up front and center.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“I’m sorry it came to this,” Cassie whispered, and the wolf’s remaining ear swiveled. There was intelligence in her gaze, but it was that of a wolf. &lt;span class="spoiler">Parker&lt;/span>
 was no more.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a touch even &lt;em>more&lt;/em> permanent than Constance or Hodin, no? And those were bad enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m curious if/when Rachel is going to actually cross that &amp;rsquo;never killed&amp;rsquo; line. It feels like it&amp;rsquo;s coming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s crazy to think that (as of now), there&amp;rsquo;s only one more. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what I&amp;rsquo;ll be listening to next! Perhaps a few one offs, rather than entire 18 book series&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/10/02/peter-nimble-and-his-fantastic-eyes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/10/02/peter-nimble-and-his-fantastic-eyes/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Peter stood back up. &amp;lsquo;Well, that was a perfectly useless conversation,&amp;rsquo; he said with a sigh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, there is a wonderful thing in this world called &amp;lsquo;foresight.&amp;rsquo; It is a gift treasured above all others because it allows one to know what the future holds. most people with foresight end up wielding immense power in life, often becoming great rulers or librarians.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that was a fun&amp;ndash;if weirdly surreal at times&amp;ndash;little adventure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Trouble with the Cursed</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/10/02/trouble-with-the-cursed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/10/02/trouble-with-the-cursed/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so here we are, the third (already?) of the continued Hollows Universe. This time around, we&amp;rsquo;ve got the fallout of taking over the city from the vampires, all sorts of chaos with Hodin, and (finally?) the introduction of a new Pixie to perhaps balance Jenks out a bit. Plus, I am enjoying seeing more of Pike in a (mostly) non-sexual/romantic relationship with Rachel, running the city together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, it&amp;rsquo;s quite a story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the first, I&amp;rsquo;ve long had an on again/off again debate about Rachel refusing to kill anyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I smiled at my warrior-poet, wishing it was that easy. But I’d never killed anyone. At least, no one who hadn’t wanted to be dead—and I wasn’t going to start now.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>On one hand, how &lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> is cursing someone into a mouse any better? Especially if there&amp;rsquo;s no plan whatsoever to return them to human form?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This book has another example of that (I&amp;rsquo;ll leave who and how as spoilers). And I suppose the main thing to consider is that&amp;ndash;well, barring some magic of course&amp;ndash;death is permanent. It&amp;rsquo;s possible that people do in fact grow and change (we see more than enough fo that in Trent and Al), but not if they&amp;rsquo;re dead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting issue to grapple with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the next&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Hodin—you remember him?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tips of Vivian’s hair began to float as she tapped the nearest ley line. I could feel her aura tingling, and I put a few more inches between us as we slowly followed Stef. “Red eyes,” she said, pulling the petals off, one by one. “Cosmic powers. Living in your church. Looks like a skinny biker dude poet.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I do enjoy Vivian and Rachel&amp;rsquo;s relationship. And I&amp;rsquo;m perhaps exactly as intrigued by and also annoyed by Hodin as I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be. So much potential to counter Al and the other demons. But in the end, it&amp;rsquo;s not who you were born as or even what you&amp;rsquo;ve done long past. It&amp;rsquo;s who you are &lt;em>now&lt;/em> that counts. And I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s all the problem, now isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the last? Jenks has been alone for a few books now. In a pixie&amp;rsquo;s life, that&amp;rsquo;s practically forever. So the introduction of a new counter to him (and I fully expect eventually more)? Wonderful. And Getty can well keep him on his toes. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, another solid entry!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m almost caught up now. Not sure what to think about that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Isles of the Emberdark</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/09/20/isles-of-the-emberdark/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/09/20/isles-of-the-emberdark/</guid><description>&lt;p>A trapper, a dragon, a ghost, a feathered man, and a hive mind meet on an island no one can find in a sea that only sort of exists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it&amp;rsquo;s not even the setup for a joke, but rather a spectacular example of everything the scifi future &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-cosmere/">The Cosmere&lt;/a> is moving towards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve already seen bits and pieces of Cosmere crossovers and magic turned technology, especially in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/27/the-lost-metal/">The Lost Metal&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-stormlight-archive/">The Stormlight Archive&lt;/a>, but this is really the first book we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten where the (magi)tech, interworld conflict, and mixmatched crews from many worlds are front and center&amp;ndash;and I love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At it&amp;rsquo;s core, Isles of the Emberdark is a sequel to the short &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/24/sixth-of-the-dusk/">Sixth of the Dusk&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;which I reread in preparation, although it turns out that wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessary. The entirety of the latter is included as flashback in the former. so it goes. An islander culture, plants and animals that want nothing more than to kill you and eat you (yes, even the plants), and the cost of being left behind as technology runs ahead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this time around, in addition to Dusk, we also have the aforementioned starship crew. I love a good scifi found family story (this reminds me of the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/wayfarers/">Wayfarers&lt;/a>) with wacky rather different crew growing together and learning to depend on one another. The more &amp;lsquo;alien&amp;rsquo;, the better. Emberdark has that in spades. It&amp;rsquo;s wonderful worldbuilding and I hope a hint of even more to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, I love Dusk. Full on &amp;lsquo;it wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually a question, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel the need to answer&amp;rsquo; and everything. Starling (dragon&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>!) is our scifi point of view and she&amp;rsquo;s just such a fun positive influence, in spite of everything. We don&amp;rsquo;t get quite as much of Nazh as I&amp;rsquo;d like (from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/06/24/shadows-for-silence-in-the-forests-of-hell/">Shadows for Silence&lt;/a>), but what we do is full of &amp;lsquo;but how does &lt;em>that&lt;/em> work. Chrysalis (a Dysian Aimian!) is a favorite &amp;lsquo;weird&amp;rsquo; character and a vehicle for exploring xenophobia. And that&amp;rsquo;s not even everyone&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>! It&amp;rsquo;s just such a mix and I think done rather well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, this is probably my favorite Cosmere story in a while. I&amp;rsquo;ve loved seeing how Sanderson has taken the idea of a shared universe with related, high details almost &amp;lsquo;sciency&amp;rsquo; hard magic and brought it forward in time&amp;ndash;and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing where it can go next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Million Dollar Demon</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/09/18/million-dollar-demon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/09/18/million-dollar-demon/</guid><description>&lt;p>And&amp;hellip; away we go!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through the last couple of books, we&amp;rsquo;ve had more than a few shake ups to the power structure of Cincinnati and the Hollows. The return of the demons&amp;ndash;and the death of one master vampire and the whole &amp;lsquo;vampire soul&amp;rsquo; binding mess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sn now when when a new crazy (even by vampire standards) master vampire is sent to take power? Well, it just stands to reason that Rachel is going to have to get involved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seeing Rachel start to stand up and actually take on the power and responsibility that she&amp;rsquo;s been flirting with (and fighting off) for all these books is a worthwhile change. I do hope it sticks. It&amp;rsquo;s a different level of story, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s about time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to that, we have the ongoing Hodin/Al hate triangle.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“I don’t know how you survive your ignorance,” he muttered. “I’ve warned you once. Now I’m telling you. If you don’t want to talk to Al, fine. I don’t want to talk to him most days. But you will not take Hodin as your mentor. He is dangerous.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Urban fantasy is famous for having love triangles all over the place, so this is certainly a fun inversion to that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m really curious to see where that goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, another solid entry and I&amp;rsquo;m curiously optimistic to see where Harrison takes it from here!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wind and Truth</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/09/12/wind-and-truth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/09/12/wind-and-truth/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>An oath could be broken, but a promise? A promise stood as long as you were still trying. A promise understood that sometimes your best wasn’t enough. A promise cried with you when all went to Damnation. A promise came to help when you could barely stand. Because a promise knew that sometimes, being there was all you could offer.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so ends the first half of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-stormlight-archive/">The Stormlight Archive&lt;/a>. I first read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/02/06/the-way-of-kings/">The Way of Kings&lt;/a> in 2014, around when &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/02/15/words-of-radiance/">Words of Radiance&lt;/a> came out. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve re-read the series again each time (for &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/03/02/oathbringer/">Oathbringer&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/21/rhythm-of-war/">Rhythm of War&lt;/a>) and each time there are new details that I&amp;rsquo;d missed or that didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense until some future reveal in a later book put things together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>quite&lt;/em> the series all told, each book at over a 1000 words. Wind and Truth is over 1300. There is just so much worldbuilding&amp;ndash;thousands of years of history&amp;ndash;magicbuilding&amp;ndash;probably the one thing Sanderson is best known for&amp;ndash;and characterbuilding&amp;ndash;you get a mental illness and &lt;em>you&lt;/em> get a mental illness, and &lt;strong>you&lt;/strong> get a mental illness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wind and Truth takes that all up to yet another level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the worldbuilding scale, we finally get a chance to visit the Spiritual Realm. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, I think it&amp;rsquo;s perhaps the least interesting realm to me&amp;ndash;the Cognitive Realm is so much cooler&amp;ndash;but it was a piece I think we needed. And a vehicle to actually make use of flashbacks and fill in a lot of the backstory of how Roshar ended up in the mess it is in now. I think we spent a bit more time here than I would have liked, but I won&amp;rsquo;t argue it wasn&amp;rsquo;t interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Magicwise (and characterwise), we get Kaladin and Szeth off to collect all the &lt;del>MacGuffins&lt;/del> Honorblades and save Sinovar. A lot of people have commented on Kaladin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m his therapist&amp;rdquo; character journey, but I think it actually works. He&amp;rsquo;s a soldier and a healer&amp;ndash;and this is a chance for him to grow into something more. They&amp;rsquo;re just such a weird pairing to see though. Especially once you add in a talking sword and a law obsessed immortal&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“What are you? &amp;hellip; are you his spren? His god?”&lt;br>
“No,” Kaladin said. “I’m his therapist.”&lt;br>
“&amp;hellip; What is that?”&lt;br>
“I honestly have no idea,” Kaladin admitted.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Otherwise characterwise, I think that my favorite couple this time around were Shallan and Adolin, despite getting quite a bit less&amp;ndash;but also more (heh)&amp;ndash;together time than one might hope. Shallan is&amp;ndash;quite honestly&amp;ndash;a mess, but her learning to deal with that and quite literally come to find herself is a fascinating story and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see that moving forward. And seeing her grow into a more confident version of herself.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Murder?” Pattern said, placing another soldier. He’d built a surprisingly tall pyramid. “Oh, you mean murder! Shallan is good at murder. Yes, mmmmm…”&lt;br>
“Pattern,” she said, “please don’t say it that way.”&lt;br>
“She is good,” Pattern corrected himself, “at making people who were once alive and threatening, unalive and unthreatening. Mmmm. Very good at it.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And Adolin&amp;ndash;to be one of the finest swordsmen in a world where gods and immortals have come to battle&amp;ndash;well, he&amp;rsquo;s just such a fun character. His interactions in particular with Yanagawn was great.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s not all! I won&amp;rsquo;t go into everything&amp;ndash;after all, if you&amp;rsquo;ve already read 4000 pages of this series, you&amp;rsquo;re going to read it (or not) regardless of what I have to say&amp;ndash;but there is just so much to this story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And oh&amp;hellip; the ending.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>She didn’t know what terrified her more. The idea of some powerful, all-knowing deity that controlled everything—destroying her free will, yet for some reason still leaving the entire world in so much pain. Or the knowledge that there were beings who ruled the cosmere with immense power—but they had all the foibles, flaws, and limited morality of anyone else.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;hellip; is going to shake things up methinks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a bummer to realize that we won&amp;rsquo;t get another Stormlight Archive until (currently) ~2031. But on the other hand, another era of Mistborn! And hey, if I&amp;rsquo;m feeling Stormlight deficient, there&amp;rsquo;s always time for another reread.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“I’m a storyteller,” Wit said, with a flip of his fingers. “I have the right to redefine words.”&lt;br>
“That’s stupid.”&lt;br>
“That’s literature.”&lt;br>
“It’s confusing.”&lt;br>
“The more confusing, the better the literature.”&lt;br>
“That might be the most pretentious thing I’ve ever heard.”&lt;br>
“Aha!” Wit said, pointing. “Now you’re getting it.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

That&amp;rsquo;s how Harrison is going to come back to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-hollows/">The Hollows&lt;/a> after that epilogue&amp;ndash;it was &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all just a dream&lt;/a>&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I actually (mostly) liked that epilogue, so it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a bummer. But if you&amp;rsquo;re going to go back to mostly status quo, well then I suppose you have to do something. I do wonder if that actually means that anyone that showed up in the &amp;lsquo;dream&amp;rsquo; can actually still die off now?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/08/19/the-witch-with-no-name/">The Witch with No Name&lt;/a> Rachel saved the world! And now she has to deal with the fallout from that. Zombies, mysterious murders, new frenemies, and once again seeing how in the &lt;em>world&lt;/em> demons are going to re-integrate into the world, oh my?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Jesus, Rachel,” Edden coaxed, but I was having none of it. “Don’t take this personally. You can’t deny that forcing couples to kill one another is demonic.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“What’s in it for them?” I asked, waving Ivy’s carefully assembled information. “Demons don’t do anything unless it’s for a profit.” Frustrated, I slapped the reports against his chest, and he fumbled for them. “And neither do I anymore,” I said.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And of course, things go sideways. Because even after everything&amp;ndash;even after it nearly ending the world more than once&amp;ndash;Rachel is still &lt;em>terrible&lt;/em> at listening to the people she&amp;rsquo;s supposed to trust and acting fully on passion first, thinking things through&amp;hellip; sometime&amp;ndash;maybe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, one theme that we continue to seem in this series is the possibility of redemption. You have literal murderers (Trent and Al in particular), but they really are trying to be better people. So how does that work? Are they allowed to work towards a better life? Do they have to pay for what they&amp;rsquo;ve done? What price is high enough murder and thousands of years of torture and slave trading?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“It’s what we do here,” Jenks said. “All are innocent until proven guilty. Even demons.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hodin’s feet scuffed the old wood floor. “How . . . quaint.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But hey, Rachel and Trent are cute together. I hope they get a few books at least to be happy.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Stop,” Trent demanded again, frowning at Quen. “Everyone, stop. Relax. Rachel, you can kill me in a few minutes. I want to talk first. You like to talk, don’t you?”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And the girls are so cute.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Because you’re a demon princess,” Lucy said, playing with my curling hair, and from the closet came Trent’s grunt of surprise. “And demon princesses are brave.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Rachel constantly worried about Trent leaving for Ellasbeth and blaming herself for all the elf politics things is growing old.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think my biggest negative for this entry comes in the ending. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of mechanical talk about what a soul is and messing with souls, but heroic or not, there&amp;rsquo;s a sacrifice play towards the end that I&amp;rsquo;m hoping gets resolved quickly&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s fun to keep going. I can only imagine having a fairly definite end, waiting the six years between the books and then learning you actually get more! No break for me though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p>
&lt;hr></description></item><item><title>The Witch with No Name</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/08/19/the-witch-with-no-name/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/08/19/the-witch-with-no-name/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it &amp;hellip; ends?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Originally &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/08/19/the-witch-with-no-name/">The Witch with No Name&lt;/a> was to be &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-hollows/">The Hollows&lt;/a> grand finale. And it certainly feels like that. Blowing up the past, shaking up the power structure of not only the demons and elves but also the vampires, saving the world, saving magic itself, and changing everything. It&amp;rsquo;s one &lt;em>heck&lt;/em> of a busy book.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Head up, I stomped along, eyeing the few pedestrians. Slowly my good mood was tarnished. Love died in the shadows, and it shouldn’t cost so much to keep it in the sun. But as Trent would say, anything gotten cheap wouldn’t last, so do what you need to do to be happy and deal with the consequences. That if love was easy, everyone would find it.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The vampires are a big part of this book&amp;ndash;dealing with what vampire &amp;lsquo;souls&amp;rsquo; are, especially for those that have died their first death. The &amp;rsquo;living vampires&amp;rsquo; in this series have been cool worldbuilding the whole time. In the end, the solution to that is a neat way to tie up a problem I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know I had. I really do wonder how long Harrison had been planning that!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But of course, don&amp;rsquo;t leave out the demons.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Al leaned close, voice dangerous as he whispered, “We don’t forget, Rachel, and it’s not as if it was our ancestors who were betrayed. It was us.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There is so much more about the very beginning of the demons here&amp;ndash;and reminders that they&amp;rsquo;re very nearly extinct&amp;ndash;and have been around a &lt;em>long&lt;/em> time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and Al is a great second example (after Trent) of us, the readers, coming to know and love the villains of the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Rachel is a pus bucket full of miracles,” the demon added, eyes rolling. “Thank you, Bis. I don’t know these new lines yet.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>He&amp;hellip; has done some really terrible things over his thousands of years. But he&amp;rsquo;s cute with the girls and nice to Rachel, so we&amp;rsquo;re just supposed to forgive that? He really does seem to have changed. This is a hard one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember a few books back when Rachel called on the witches of San Francisco to ring their bells and work together to help her&amp;ndash;and nothing. This time around, it&amp;rsquo;s the demons she&amp;rsquo;s calling out to. And I think that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much where this series has gone. Demons may do some terrible things&amp;ndash;but in the end, they&amp;rsquo;re also just people. Super long lived powerful people, but still people. And people of all stripes can be good&amp;ndash;or evil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love how much crazy stuff happens in this book. I love that it was set up as a finale, given Harrison the permission to do some &lt;em>crazy&lt;/em> things that you normally don&amp;rsquo;t see that often in long running series. And I do appreciate getting a happy ever after epilogue (see &lt;a href="#the-ending">later&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, that&amp;rsquo;s quite the book. It actually gives a good point where you could end. And a lot of people probably thought that &lt;em>was&lt;/em> the end. But I have the benefit of having read these a decade later, and there&amp;rsquo;s more! We&amp;rsquo;ll just have to see how in the &lt;em>world&lt;/em> Harrison handles that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You’d be amazed how often the police never get to the bottom of a case. You can investigate a crime, identify a suspect, and put together enough evidence to send them up the steps to await Her Majesty’s pleasure and still never know all the whys and wherefores.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/05/lies-sleeping/">a minute&lt;/a> since I last read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/rivers-of-london/">Rivers of London&lt;/a>, but&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;re back!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with the fallout of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/05/lies-sleeping/">Lies Sleeping&lt;/a>, most especially a certain death. Or&amp;ndash;perhaps just using that as an excuse for Peter to go under cover, deep into the tech bro scene of London?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how the stories are (slowly) changing as we go. Peter feels older and more serious. That&amp;rsquo;s not quite to say that he&amp;rsquo;s going not still cracking jokes and making random scifi/fantasy references (&lt;em>so many&lt;/em> Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide references&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>), but he&amp;rsquo;s also now dealing with the responsibilities of a growing Folly&amp;ndash;and of course the responsibilities of Bev&amp;rsquo;s growing Bulge (she&amp;rsquo;s pregnant :p)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Magic is almost impossible to do when you’re pissed, although you can bet many have tried. So drinking with a rival practitioner can be considered, if not a peace offering, then at least a sign that you’re not planning to fight them straight away.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Plus, the &amp;lsquo;undercover&amp;rsquo; bits are a different sort of policing than we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten thus far. It&amp;rsquo;s one of teh most compelling parts of this series, so I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see it!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It’s one of those weird truths you learn early on as police that quite a high percentage of the public have all the survival instincts of a moth in a candle factory.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Structurewise, we spend the first chapter of the story wandering what exactly we missed&amp;ndash;made even worse with a several month gap&amp;ndash;and it only gets worse when we start bouncing back and forth between two storylines a couple of months apart. Honestly, I see what Aaronovitch was going there, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it actually helped the story &lt;em>that&lt;/em> much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worldbuildingwise, it&amp;rsquo;s a neat bit of tech/magic mashup. Minor spoilers (in my opinion):&lt;/p>
&lt;span class="spoiler">
&lt;blockquote>
’What do you think?’ asked Skinner.&lt;br />
‘That thing just passed the fucking Turing Test,’ I said.&lt;br />
‘Multiple times,’ he said. ‘Under properly controlled conditions.’&lt;br />
‘Fuck me,’ I said. ‘You’ve got a working AI.’&lt;br />
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/span>

&lt;p>Amusing that, given all the &lt;span class="spoiler">recent advances specifically with LLMs&lt;/span>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course, all the thoughts on the &amp;rsquo;techbro&amp;rsquo; industry and all the problems that come with that.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>These techbros have tunnel vision,’ said Stephen. ‘They’re so fucking busy with their dreams of the future they don’t stop to think about where they are or what the fuck they’re doing.’&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last decade in this world. He&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; not wrong a lot of the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, tech people naming things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Magratheean Ape-Descended Life Form Utilisation Service&amp;hellip; MADLFUS. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I enjoyed it! And we&amp;rsquo;re almost up to the present date! I&amp;rsquo;m curious to see what&amp;rsquo;s next.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Random thought:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Because, in America, small towns run their own police departments pretty much unsupervised and a few had hit upon the idea of charging wannabe cops a fee to become peace officers.&lt;br>
‘You’re having me on,’ I said.&lt;br>
‘Nope,’ said Reynolds. ‘Meet Lake Arthur, population 430. Current police force a hundred plus – most of whom aren’t residents.’&lt;br>
For 400 dollars you could get a badge and the right to carry a concealed firearm. Rumour had it Elon Musk had bought one for himself.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Is &amp;hellip; that really a thing? Also&amp;hellip; the Musk bit certainly aged.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Also also:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>‘Somebody else came during the night and magicked them,’ I said.
‘Is that a real term – “magicked?”’ asked Guleed.
‘And it’s spelt with a “k”, too,’ I said. ‘But the technical term is actually “enchanted”. Only the trouble with that word is that everyone starts thinking glass slippers and spinning wheels.’&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>The Undead Pool</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/08/08/the-undead-pool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/08/08/the-undead-pool/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Minor spoilers, mostly for the romance bits of the series&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this is the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a decade (for people reading along as the series came out) / six months (for me), &lt;span class="spoiler">they're finally together&lt;/span>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Yeah, the elf looks good in the sun,” Jenks smart-mouthed, the pixy currently sitting on the bottom of my hooped earrings and out of the moderate wind. “When you going to put us all out of your misery and boink him?”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Given how it all started, you could totally expe4ct it coming&amp;hellip; and I&amp;rsquo;m actually really rooting for them. I think they&amp;rsquo;ve both become better people through the books. Rachel is at least marginally less terrible at rushing into things and Trent is not outright murdering people quite so often. #goals&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it does lead to all sorts of fun politics. See, she&amp;rsquo;s a demon and he&amp;rsquo;s an elf. And the demons and elves &lt;strong>hate&lt;/strong> one another. Something something, thousands of years of war and slavery. So of course this is going to come with all sorts of drama.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Red finally gave up trying to bolt, and Trent settled into the saddle. The last couple of months with Trent had been… interesting. With Ellasbeth threatening to stay, I was seeing things in the light of “last time” and I was shocked to realize I didn’t like it, especially not with Landon’s threat. If not for the different tax bracket thing, or that he was going to be engaged, or that because of me, he’d lose everything if he didn’t marry Ellasbeth…&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s just the romance part&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of &lt;em>that&lt;/em> we have magic going amuck, going quite a bit deeper into how elf magic works&amp;ndash;and just what/if their &amp;lsquo;goddess&amp;rsquo; actually is.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Duh. You think I’m going to trash anything Newt gives me? The woman is crazy, not stupid.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Rachel of course has to save the day, but it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a bit of a mess to get there. Rachel is really leveling up. It&amp;rsquo;s not quite a &amp;lsquo;chosen one&amp;rsquo; plot, but given how unique she is in this entire world, it&amp;rsquo;s a near cousin of it. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to think about that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But storywise, it&amp;rsquo;s quite an action packed adventure. Romancewise&amp;ndash;like I said&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how this all shakes out.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Etude nodded, and as Jenks buried himself in my hair, I closed my eyes to block out the dizzy sensation. Behind me, I felt the train race on without the mystics. The splinter was following me, harrowing, nipping, stabbing at my heels. Ill and nauseated, I hung in Etude’s grip, thinking that I should have just called the damn eagles from the beginning and done this alone.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A solid book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Never Whistle at Night: An Indigenous Dark Fiction Anthology</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/08/03/never-whistle-at-night-an-indigenous-dark-fiction-anthology/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/08/03/never-whistle-at-night-an-indigenous-dark-fiction-anthology/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Many Indigenous people believe that one should never whistle at night. This belief takes many forms: for instance, Native Hawaiians believe it summons the Hukai’po, the spirits of ancient warriors, and Native Mexicans say it calls Lechuza, a witch that can transform into an owl. But what all these legends hold in common is the certainty that whistling at night can cause evil spirits to appear—and even follow you home.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A collection of two dozen horror (and otherwise dark fiction) stories by a wide variety of indigenous authors. Three of which I&amp;rsquo;d read before:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/rebecca-roanhorse/">Rebecca Roanhorse&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/darcie-little-badger/">Darcie Little Badger&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/cherie-dimaline/">Cherie Dimaline&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Like any anthology there are some stories in here that I didn&amp;rsquo;t care much for&amp;ndash;and some that really hit hard. Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating new look (for me) into all sorts of new and interesting creepy things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And all too often, you might just find that people are people. And people are scarier than any monster out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>So, for these next pages, let these writers take you by the hand, lead you into the darkness at the heart of—let me put some quotation marks around it—“America.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>Ever After</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/30/ever-after/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/30/ever-after/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Everyone needed someone to watch their back.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the world&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&amp;ndash;and it might just be Rachel&amp;rsquo;s fault&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now she has to do the impossible, save the world&amp;ndash;magic itself&amp;ndash;face off against Ku&amp;rsquo;Sox&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and somehow work with both Trent and Al at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What could &lt;em>possibly&lt;/em> go wrong?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(A lot. A lot could go wrong.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Except demons &lt;em>don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> live in reality. They have no rights. They don&amp;rsquo;t exist. And they most certainly register cars.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“I should’ve kept my mouth shut,” he said, shooting a quick glance at the knots, and I shrugged. Perhaps, but there was no sense in crying over squished tomatoes.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh. And Rachel&amp;rsquo;s avoiding her magic, Trent&amp;rsquo;s embracing his, and an anti-interland hate group is of course up to &lt;em>no&lt;/em> good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Million Dollar Baby</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/17/million-dollar-baby/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/17/million-dollar-baby/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another novella from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/22/into-the-woods-tales-from-the-hollows-and-beyond/">Into the Woods&lt;/a>: The story of what Jenks and Trent were up to during &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/13/pale-demon/">Pale Demon&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>ELF QUEST!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s really quite spoilery (for Pale Demon) to really get into what that &lt;em>actually&lt;/em> means, but the short version is that we get another major magical heist novel, which is all sorts of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Trent and Jenks are a surprisingly fun combo. It&amp;rsquo;s nice every once in a while to have parts about Rachel without having her on screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“No, not really.” One hand holding his wings tight to his body, Jenks turned to look behind him at their forward progress. “Rachel makes enough mistakes in one week to fill a twenty-yard dump truck.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Exactly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and more elf politics:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>He trusted people. He trusted quite a few, and quite a few had “screwed him over” as Jenks put it. The difference was that when people betrayed him, sometimes other people died. And then other people thought it was his fault. He was tired of it. Everything he had was at risk for the next four hours. Quen said he was not his father, but he was doing the same damning things. &amp;hellip; The Goddess help him, they had to come out of the closet if only so he could stop killing people.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A fun short story! And with even &lt;em>more&lt;/em> implications to the broader Hollows universe than Pale Demon. It&amp;rsquo;ll be interesting to see how that all shakes out.&lt;/p>

She has one chance to travel (on purpose this time) to San Francisco to try to clear her name. Except&amp;hellip; she can&amp;rsquo;t fly, because politics&amp;ndash;road trip! And has to take Trent, also because politics&amp;ndash;road trip with Jenks, Ivy, Rachel, and Trent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Jenks: Relax cookie maker. They’ve been there since Terre Haute.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>lol. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keebler%20elves">Keebler elves&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terre%20Haute">Terre Haute&lt;/a>. I went to school there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then they blew up a national monument.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And freed a demon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And saved another demon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And learned what is actually &lt;em>different&lt;/em> about the female demons.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But Al was shaking his head, looking ill. “I am not going to be the person who completes you,” he said, glancing at me and turning away. “You are one messed-up bitch.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And suddenly&amp;hellip; &lt;em>baby&lt;/em>! (I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you to guess if it&amp;rsquo;s who you expect or not).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man that&amp;rsquo;s a lot for a single book. And with what looks like might be permanent reprecussions across the Hollows universe (and Rachel especially) that we&amp;rsquo;re only barely beginning to feel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: This was a fun line:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“So all those buttons are different restaurants?” I asked, looking at the jukebox, now totally out of place, like a British police call box on the deck of the Titanic.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I understood that reference. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second side note: So&amp;hellip; how many cross breeds are possible in this universe? We have some hints because of how species diverged from one another. And we also have elves with some human lineage. But what else is possible? And what if we include all sorts of genetic tampering that is seemingly possible in this world&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Black Magic Sanction</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/19/black-magic-sanction/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/19/black-magic-sanction/</guid><description>&lt;p>So. Alcatraz is back in service. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of brilliant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, Rachel is dealing with her shunning&amp;ndash;and far far worse. The witches of the world aren&amp;rsquo;t on her side any more, but perhaps she can get some help from&amp;hellip; Trent? Al? Nick?! (Why is Nick back around&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the only way out is&amp;hellip; suddenly, we have a heist novel now. It seems like this is &lt;em>really&lt;/em> not the time. And double that, when Rachel randomly decides to use that Pandora charm that&amp;rsquo;s been floating around. &lt;em>now?!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man she has issues with long term thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;How did you know we were in trouble?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re always in trouble, Rachel,&amp;rdquo; he said, fixing his hat firmly back on his head.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And seems &lt;em>so very&lt;/em> deadset on not killing anything ever. Which, I suppose if you&amp;rsquo;re going to do black magic, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to give anyone any other reasons to hate you. But sometimes, especially in a world like this, there are people you just can&amp;rsquo;t hang on to. Oy. (Not to mention that she seems fine with those around her killing&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially after 8 books. And after what happened to Jenks&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, another good story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Random world building notes:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>His eyes were alight. I&amp;rsquo;d seen that look on college students debating such ridiculous stuff as how the world would be today if Napoleon hadn&amp;rsquo;t stirred that misaligned spell and won Waterloo, or if the Turn had never happened and we&amp;rsquo;d gone to the moon instead. &amp;ldquo;Okay, I got that,&amp;rdquo; I said, and Pierce pushed from the table to take his plate to the sink.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I do love the subtle(ish) nods to our world / what might have been. Good times those.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ley Line Drifter</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/15/ley-line-drifter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/15/ley-line-drifter/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another novella from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/22/into-the-woods-tales-from-the-hollows-and-beyond/">Into the Woods&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, this time with Jenks striking out on his own (more or less) to save the day!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First thought: Jenks and Bis is a fun dynamic. Jenks is a lot when he&amp;rsquo;s a side character, but somehow seeing into his head is so much better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In that reguard, have we actually seen on screen/page what Jenks wished for all the way back in the first book? Daw.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And has Rachel figured out what I think Jenks already knows here about what the embeggining actually did to him?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second thought:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Jenks?” Bis said loudly, half hiding behind Sylvan’s statue. “Maybe we should leave the goddess alone.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Huh. So thinking about it, have we really seen much in the way of &amp;rsquo;tiers&amp;rsquo; of creatures in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-hollows/">The Hollows&lt;/a>? There are some that are difficult for others to fight, but nothing truly &amp;lsquo;godly&amp;rsquo;. Interesting that.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And what about Daryl, anyway? A deluded nymph, Sylvan had said. A goddess, Daryl claimed. There were no gods or goddesses. Never had been, but there were documented histories of Inderlanders taking advantage of humans, posing as deities. He frowned. Her eyes were downright creepy, and he hadn’t liked demons being mentioned, either.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I wonder if that will stick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise&amp;hellip; we learn in this book that apparently Pixies can &lt;span class="spoiler">make explosives&lt;/span>
. Delightful. And no one knows. Probably for the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally, some last bits of world building around pixies and gargoyles. They eat pigeons (the latter) and their names get longer the further down the birth order they are (the former).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a fun little story. Always neat to see the side characters get their chance to shine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do bet that, just like banshees, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the last we&amp;rsquo;ll see of nymphs/dryads in this series. Or at least I hope it isn&amp;rsquo;t!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Misty of Chincoteague</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/13/misty-of-chincoteague/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/13/misty-of-chincoteague/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, that&amp;rsquo;s a cute little story for what it is. And my daughter really enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, oldentimes life on an island. Yearly, all the people on the island go across to another one, round up wild horses, and drive them across the island to train and sell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course our young protagonists find the horse of their dreams and go through everything to find and bring her back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s cute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note, it&amp;rsquo;s fun finding out that Misty was a real horse! Although, perhaps don&amp;rsquo;t read too far into all that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_of_Chincoteague_%28novel%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspiration&lt;/a>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>White Witch, Black Curse</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/11/white-witch-black-curse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/11/white-witch-black-curse/</guid><description>&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; banshee?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Heh. Called it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So basically, we have Rachel dealing with the events/fallout of &lt;em>Dirty Magic&lt;/em> (from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/22/into-the-woods-tales-from-the-hollows-and-beyond/">Into the Woods&lt;/a>): wherein we find out what banshees are in the world of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-hollows/">The Hollows&lt;/a> and see Ivy dealing with one&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, I think this might be the first main book in which we see Robbie (also in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/22/two-ghosts-for-sister-rachel/">Two Ghosts for Sister Rachel&lt;/a>)&amp;hellip; and he&amp;rsquo;s not the only one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So anyways, we have Rachel still dealing with the fallout of Kistin&amp;rsquo;s death, a new uber-predator on the loose (banshees are basically vampires on steroids it seems), a blast from the past (both in general and Rachel&amp;rsquo;s specifically), Al, witch sex, auras, and SHUNNING (all caps).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Sweet mother of Tink,” Jenks whispered from the ladle. “What just happened?&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Quite a book.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Jenks flew two circles around me to stretch his wings, then landed on Ivy’s shoulder. She was staring at the city, mesmerized. “It looks peaceful from up here,” she said when her line of sight was broken by a member of the waitstaff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jenks snorted. “It looks peaceful when you get up real close, too,” he said, and I thought of my garden. “It’s only the middle ground that’s ugly.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But hey, (minor spoilers), we do get at least some forward progress on Kistin&amp;rsquo;s murderer!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, another solid entry. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Outlaw Demon Wails</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/03/the-outlaw-demon-wails/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/03/the-outlaw-demon-wails/</guid><description>&lt;p>Okay, enough side stories (and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/19/the-turn-the-hollows-begins-with-death/">prequels&lt;/a>!). Back to the main story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, Rachel can do demon things. And in doing so, she&amp;rsquo;s managed to really piss off one demon: Algaliarept (Al). Now he&amp;rsquo;s out every night on a technicality and coming for Rachel.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“You can’t forget anything,” I said, watching the words vanish into nothing. “And even if you do, it always comes back to bitch-slap you in the morning.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So how in the world is she going to solve this one? Well&amp;hellip; perhaps not in &lt;em>the world&lt;/em> after all.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Rache?” Jenks said warily, hovering as I hid my hands so he couldn’t see them shake. “What did you do?”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, more elf shenanigans with Trent and Ceri (although not the two of them together :whew:).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Relationship drama, both with Ivy and perhaps with Marshal (from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/19/a-fistful-of-charms/">A Fistful of Charms&lt;/a>). It&amp;rsquo;s not quite Kistin, but it will be interesting to see. And uniting auras. What&amp;rsquo;s up with that? A mystery for another book I suppose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and historical drama with Rachel&amp;rsquo;s mom (now that was a bombshell&amp;hellip;). I figured something was up with that, but man that was still a hit. It will be interesting to see where that goes&amp;ndash;and if her mom will become a larger player going forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and suddenly Ryn Cormel. Who I just met in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/19/the-turn-the-hollows-begins-with-death/">The Turn&lt;/a>. Interesting that. If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t read the prequel, would I have missed out on anything? Probably not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and a Gargoyle. I expected more from that. But perhaps next book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I &lt;em>really&lt;/em> enjoyed this one. This series has turned out to be primarily about demons, but&amp;hellip; perhaps that makes sense given, well, everything. I&amp;rsquo;m here for it though!&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Side note: I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to these on audiobok. Why&amp;hellip; does this one have a different narrator? It&amp;rsquo;s a bit jarring. Piss-ker-ee. Lee line. Jenks&amp;rsquo; new voice. I think it&amp;rsquo;d be perfectly fine (although lee line would probably still bother me), but I&amp;rsquo;d just gotten so used to the other!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/21045927-a-change-in-narrator-for-this-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is a discussion about this&lt;/a> on Goodreads.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ms. Gavin and I are both working to get her to read AMERICAN DEMON. Should happen!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ndash; Kim Harrison&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Not a why, but at least it&amp;rsquo;s known? And apparently we&amp;rsquo;ll go back to Marguerite Gavin after this one!&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Second side note: The fact that they said &amp;lsquo;Al went into human resources&amp;rsquo; is certainly a choice. And they just skate &lt;em>right on&lt;/em> by that one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Into the Woods: Tales from the Hollows and Beyond</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/22/into-the-woods-tales-from-the-hollows-and-beyond/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/22/into-the-woods-tales-from-the-hollows-and-beyond/</guid><description>&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1mGnIAxWGb2DBnlqwCqOuO?utm_source=generator&amp;theme=0"

&lt;p>Now that that is out of the way &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Into the Woods is a collection of Hollows Shorts. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve liked the series enough to go ahead and want todo everything about it, I decided to pick up all the shorts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because I track my reading, I have to draw the line somewhere, so here it is: all of the short stories will be collected here (updating as I read them). Novellas (and novelettes?) will get their own posts.&lt;/p>

Young Rachel (finishing school, desperately wanting to go to the IS), still living at home with her mother, when her brother comes to visit! Given that we&amp;rsquo;ve barely seen them on page (&lt;em>have&lt;/em> we see her brother?), it&amp;rsquo;s some fun bit of backstory&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then the entire story revolves around trying to contact Rachel&amp;rsquo;s dead father to win a bet (and to join the IS in his footsteps), well, of course things are going to get complicated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun story with just the right amount of gut punches and backstory. I do wonder what we&amp;rsquo;ll see &amp;lsquo;in between&amp;rsquo;. How does Rachel end up strong enough to go on runs? She certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t doing that well here. And will see see her time at that camp?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, worth the read!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: red eye flights being renamed to &amp;lsquo;vamp flights&amp;rsquo; is a fun detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also: &amp;lsquo;Spell checker&amp;rsquo;. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also also: Man Rachel really will fall for anyone, won&amp;rsquo;t she&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Undead in the Garden of Good and Evil</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/20/undead-in-the-garden-of-good-and-evil/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/20/undead-in-the-garden-of-good-and-evil/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Life was more than waiting for it to end so she could started living.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Man Ivy is a mess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this is the/a story of how Ivy came to be, how screwy (heh) vampires can be, how she got to be working as a runner, and how she came to meet Rachel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a pretty fun way to set it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and much like &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/22/into-the-woods-tales-from-the-hollows-and-beyond/#the-bridges-of-eden-park">The Bridges of Eden Park&lt;/a> this (especially the Kisten parts) back to back with &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/11/for-a-few-demons-more/">For a Few Demons More&lt;/a> is certainly a touch of whiplash.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Turn: The Hollows Begins with Death</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/19/the-turn-the-hollows-begins-with-death/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/19/the-turn-the-hollows-begins-with-death/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The only thing worse than starting a plague on purpose was being stupid enough to start it by accident.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ve read (and quite enjoyed) enough of the Hollows that I want to go back and pick up the short stories and other supplementary stories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter: The Turn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The story of science, betrayal, tomatoes, and a whole bunch of deaths that changed the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun story. While I really do appreciate that the Hollows is a world with without a &amp;lsquo;masquerade&amp;rsquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see the world before (and &lt;em>as&lt;/em>) all of the various Interlanders came out into the open. Especially seeing who was involved&amp;ndash;and wondering just what they&amp;rsquo;re all up to in the more modern time I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“A person is okay,” he said, peering into the darkness and the open street. “But when you put a bunch of us together, something is switched on, something ugly.” He glanced at her apologetically. “All of us, humans and nonhumans alike, are genetically primed to attack what’s different from the collective.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Overall, a fun story to set up. As far as I&amp;rsquo;ve read, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to read for the main series, but I&amp;rsquo;ms till glad to have read it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bastille vs. the Evil Librarians</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/11/bastille-vs.-the-evil-librarians/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/11/bastille-vs.-the-evil-librarians/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it ends. Again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the events of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/23/the-dark-talent/">The Dark Talent&lt;/a>, Alcatraz isn&amp;rsquo;t doing so well&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, the Talents are still gone, several Smedrys are dead&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and the world is about to end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So of course we have one last adventure. Chock full of impossible situations, anti-gravity sharks, a Gak, &lt;em>so&lt;/em> many straw puns&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and an army of kittens&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, romance&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and a big battle on top of a giant glass spire in the middle of the ocean!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing that was kind of odd to me (having read &lt;em>almost&lt;/em> all of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/brandon-sanderson/">Brandon Sanderson&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s works at this point) is how the fine details of the magic system never quite came together&amp;ndash;and now they probably never will. The talents are a lot of fun, magic glass is neat&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;sup id="fnref:8">&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and somehow they are related&amp;hellip; but how does it all work? Is Alcatraz right? Where did it come from?! I know it&amp;rsquo;s not a &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-cosmere/">Cosmere&lt;/a> novel, so it gets a bit of a bye for that, but I wanted more. So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, compared to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/23/the-dark-talent/">The Dark Talent&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s actually an ending, which I greatly appreciate. Other than that, I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s a weaker entry into the series. Still a lot of fun to read and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have finally gotten to them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;sup id="fnref:9">&lt;a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>For a Few Demons More</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/11/for-a-few-demons-more/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/11/for-a-few-demons-more/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There were no more choices, no more options, no more clever ways out of a tough situation. And the rush, I realized in a brutal wash of despair, is a false god I’ve chased my entire life. One that cost me everything in the blind search for sensation. My entire existence amounted to nothing.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That title is not a lie&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not just Algaliarept (Al &amp;#x1f604;) this time around. We also are introduced to Newt&amp;ndash;just sort of pops in and shows off some serious magical chops&amp;hellip; and then reveals that she&amp;rsquo;s not entirely sane any more. Mildly terrifying that. Plus Minias, her minder, who actually seems decent&amp;ndash;for a demon. Rachel is getting in pretty hard with all of these different favors owed (both ways). Makes for quite the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that Trent&amp;rsquo;s getting married. And Rachel&amp;rsquo;s not only invited&amp;hellip; but in the wedding party? Well, actually it&amp;rsquo;s to provide security (hint: demons). But of course any time you put Trent and Rachel together there&amp;rsquo;s going to be trouble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if &lt;em>that&lt;/em> wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough&amp;hellip; we have even more vampire trouble. Rachel and Ivy are such a mess&amp;ndash;and that one really can&amp;rsquo;t last too many more books. One step forward&amp;ndash;and another two back. And Kisten. Oh Kisten. Still not a good person, but perhaps good for Rachel? &lt;span class="spoiler">Oh Harrison, *that* was a low blow.&lt;/span>
&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I’ve got your back. Nothing alive will ever hurt you if I have breath in me. And nothing dead will hurt you if I don’t.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Man that&amp;rsquo;s a story. Probably the most intense so far. I fully expect (and hope) that this really shakes up the world of the Hollows and I&amp;rsquo;m curious where in the &lt;em>world&lt;/em> we can go from here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sorcery and Small Magics</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/06/sorcery-and-small-magics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/06/sorcery-and-small-magics/</guid><description>&lt;p>A world in which magic is split between those who can write spells and those who can cast them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A forbidden spell gone horribly wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And a quest to try to undo it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s actually a really fun story. I enjoyed the magic school aspects of it and it had a nice whimsical &lt;em>magical&lt;/em> feeling to the magic that you don&amp;rsquo;t always see, even in fantasy novels. Once we get out of the school, we see more of the hidden, dangerous parts of the world, driving more to the fantastical&amp;ndash;and deadly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On another tack, this book is tagged romance and LBGT. If anything, it&amp;rsquo;s more of magical adventure story with the first hints of what could turn out to be romance&amp;ndash;but not in this book. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting thread woven through the story&amp;ndash;especially in how it&amp;rsquo;s interacting with aforementioned forbidden spell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, the interplay between our main characters&amp;ndash;Leo (writer, POV) and Grimm (caster) is fascinating. Leo&amp;rsquo;s family is rich, Grimm&amp;rsquo;s is not. Leo is born talented and refuses to apply himself; Grimm has worked &lt;em>hard&lt;/em> to get where he is and it shows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That dynamic drives the entire story and it, as much as anything, is why I&amp;rsquo;d love to see where the story goes in the (hopefully coming soon?) sequel. It&amp;rsquo;s a well enough wrapped up story, but oh, it&amp;rsquo;s one of those where I want to see what happens next!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well worth a read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Once and Future Witches</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/29/the-once-and-future-witches/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/29/the-once-and-future-witches/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>One witch you can laugh at. Three you can burn. But what do you do with a hundred?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The Eastwood sisters grew up hard, with a mother dead in childbirth and an abusive father. The older lost as they could and the younger left in a somewhat more&amp;hellip; &lt;em>abrupt&lt;/em> manner. And then, somehow, they all ended up at the same suffrage rally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>James Juniper. Maiden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Agnes Amaranth. Mother.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beatrice Belladonna. Crone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating tale, digging into women&amp;rsquo;s right (suffrage and otherwise), race, homophobia, and sexuality told in an alternate history end of the 1800s, all wrapped a world where witches are &lt;em>real&lt;/em>. Where magic lies waiting. And where women&amp;rsquo;s tales have &lt;em>power&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>All of us grew up on stories of wicked witches. The villages they cursed, the plagues they brewed. We need to show people what else we have to offer, give them better stories.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m by no means an expert on the time period, so I&amp;rsquo;ve no idea how much of the characters and events of the stories have a basis in our world, but it has the feel of a world that could very well have been real&amp;ndash;something in the world just down the road.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Or perhaps for all of them: for the little girls thrown in cellars and the grown women sent to workhouses, the mothers who shouldn’t have died and the witches who shouldn’t have burned. For all the women punished merely for wanting what they shouldn’t.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I quite enjoyed this book!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Fistful of Charms</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/19/a-fistful-of-charms/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/19/a-fistful-of-charms/</guid><description>&lt;p>Okay, enough vampire/demon nonsense for a moment, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about weres.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>As the joke goes, you don’t have to be faster than the wolf chasing you, just faster than everyone else running away.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Turns out that trying to get letter-of-the-law against multiple packs of werewolves has consequences. For everyone involved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nick&amp;hellip; is a real piece of work. I will grant him the one small saving grace that he (along with most of the world) thought Rachel dead as part of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/14/every-which-way-but-dead/">Every Which Way But Dead&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&amp;hellip; but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make him any better a person. At least Rachel eventually realizes it? Sort of. Mostly. Ish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rachel and Ivy&amp;hellip; come to a serious head in this book. Which went about as badly as I expected. I do wish the best for Ivy, but she certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t make that easy at times and Rachel is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> helping matters here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It (among a number of other plotlines in these books) are yet a bit more of Rachel being so sure she&amp;rsquo;s right and never quite taking responsibility for when that goes sidewise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jenks? I am &lt;em>so&lt;/em> glad to see him back again. The whole running off because of not being trusted last book, I get that. But Jenks is just so fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Plan B?&amp;rdquo; Ivy said. &amp;ldquo;What is plan B?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
Jenks reddened. &amp;ldquo;Grab the fish and run like hell,&amp;rdquo; he muttered, and I almost giggled.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And now there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em>whole lot more&lt;/em> Jenks. Which &amp;hellip; kind of weird and I don&amp;rsquo;t really get it. I do wonder if that&amp;rsquo;s going to be a recurring theme or was a one off. Half-related, the entire premise that Pixies only live ~20 years and Jenks is just about there? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to deal with this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a fun read and I appreciated a new set of problems. Onward!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: Trent&amp;rsquo;s near complete absense was a bit strange. On one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s not his flavor of nonsense going on this time around, so it makes sense. But on the other hand, we have crime and rare artifacts, I fully expected that to bring him in.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Every Which Way But Dead</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/14/every-which-way-but-dead/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/14/every-which-way-but-dead/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And oh, that climax. This is most certainly going to come back and bite Rachel. But honestly, what other choice did she even have?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ndash; me, re: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/08/the-good-the-bad-and-the-undead/">The Good, the Bad, and the Undead&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Yup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All that vampire/demon business of the previous book? Causing all sorts of chaos this time around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rachel, remaining entirely &lt;em>absolutely sure she is right about everything to the detriment of everyone around her&lt;/em>? Also chaos-causing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nick-trauma and Rachel not realizing that &amp;rsquo;thing never done before&amp;rsquo; was causing some serious issues? Chaos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nick is out of town, so totally platonic date with Kristen&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Who apparently has murdered people, because&amp;hellip; duh? Vampire?&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, but he promised not to do it anymore. Chaos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do appreciate seeing Demon Al as an actual &lt;em>demon&lt;/em>. Holding a prisoner for a thousand years. I&amp;rsquo;m just waiting for an attempted redemption arc there, but as it is it &lt;em>feels good&lt;/em> when Rachel gets one over on him. And Ceri has some interesting potential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh these books. Onwards!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Good, the Bad, and the Undead</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/08/the-good-the-bad-and-the-undead/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/08/the-good-the-bad-and-the-undead/</guid><description>&lt;p>And away we go!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/02/dead-witch-walking/">Dead Witch Walking&lt;/a> set up the world, it&amp;rsquo;s here where we really start setting up Rachel Morgan and go as investigators in their own right. And of course, they&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled right into a serial killer targeting leyline witches. Good times that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is quite the cast of characters this time around. Trent Kamalack is back and as morally &amp;rsquo;totally morally gray, but maybe for good reasons&amp;rsquo; kind of person&amp;ndash;and we do get to learn the what/why he is, which is neat.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Come work for me, and I’ll tell you.”&lt;br>
My eyes went to his. “You are a thief, a cheat, a murderer, and a not-nice man,” I said calmly. “I don’t like you.”&lt;br>
He shrugged, the motion making him look utterly harmless. “I’m not a thief,” he said. “And I don’t mind manipulating you into working for me when I need it.” He smiled, showing me perfect teeth. “I enjoy it, actually.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Head local vamp Piscary is scary and understated. Rachel&amp;rsquo;s mother is wacky. Her father&amp;hellip; had secrets. And Nick&amp;hellip; well, I&amp;rsquo;m happy if Rachel is happy, but that is so not going to go well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worldbuildingwise, getting more into what exactly layline magic is, how demons work in this world (parallel reality that&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em>really&lt;/em> Hell go!), how these vampires are different, and more &amp;lsquo;humans are terrified of tomatoes&amp;rsquo; than you can shake a stick at. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun world and I always like seeing how many different ways you can turn common tropes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On another hand&amp;hellip; man Rachel is kind of an idiot sometimes. She&amp;rsquo;s so absolutely sure shre&amp;rsquo;s right even when &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em> around her is trying to get her see the truth. Oy that was frustrating. One would htink that trying to set out on her own would make her a little more risk averse&amp;ndash;but I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s not in the cards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And oh, that climax. This is most certainly going to come back and bite Rachel. But honestly, what other choice did she even have?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a fun series and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to keep going. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lies Sleeping</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/05/lies-sleeping/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/05/lies-sleeping/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Faceless Man on the run&amp;ndash;and trying to ring in&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> some new form of chaos to bring London to its knees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along the way, we&amp;rsquo;ll bump into new characters and, even better, fill in a few more holes in the histories of others. Each step we get closer to Molly&amp;rsquo;s tale is well appreciated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And man. Lesley has some trauma to work through.

&lt;p>Making a spell is easy. It&amp;rsquo;s trusting you did it right that&amp;rsquo;s hard.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Another new (to me) urban fantasy in a &amp;rsquo;the supernatural world has been made public&amp;rsquo; world? Yes please!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, we have Rachel a witch and, as of the start of the story, bounty hunter. Frustrated with her job, she decides to quit.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I sighed. I hated the maze of bureaucracy with a passion, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found the best way to deal with it is to smile and act stupid. That way, no one gets confused.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And in this world, you just &lt;em>don&amp;rsquo;t do that&lt;/em>. So now she&amp;rsquo;s gone from bounty hunter to having a price oh &lt;em>her&lt;/em> head, backed only by her friend(ish) and former co-worker, living Vamp Ivy and Jenks&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, a four-inch tall pixie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, she&amp;rsquo;s also stumbling into a super natural drug trade, a whole rat fighting ring (from impressively up close and personal), and summoned demons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rachel is a lot of fun. Perfectly competent and willing to fight for it, even if things don&amp;rsquo;t always go right. I enjoy Ivy, even if she&amp;rsquo;s still mostly closed off through this book. Room to grow. And Jenks is hilarious. &amp;ldquo;You think my kids just popped out of the ground?&amp;rdquo; and all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The worldbuilding is a lot of fun. I always like trying to figure out what&amp;rsquo;s diffrerent about this particular urban fntasty world and there is plenty of that here. Born vampires&amp;ndash;&lt;em>living&lt;/em> and only turning more traditional after death. Pixies and fairies, running their own smaller scale wars over garden space. Genetic engineering run amuck&amp;ndash;leading to a perfectly reasonable fear of tomatoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s quite a a world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it&amp;rsquo;s fun to have the main character be a witch. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely certain how much of a witch&amp;rsquo;s magic is natural versus learned just yet, but mostly human magic user is always a fun point of view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far I&amp;rsquo;m cautiously optimistic. I do love a good urban fantasy. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun world (with openly acknowledged supernatural characters!) with fun characters and a lot of room to grow. And grow it did&amp;ndash;with 18 out as of now&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>

I loved the worldbuilding and main character, I think if anything, it&amp;rsquo;s far too short as a novella. I wanted more!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Although, from what Teshar had heard, every pyramid was intended to be entered. People would want to bring offerings for the dead Emperor, servants would want to tend things every once in a while; a lot of people prayed to past Emperors, because they were easier to talk to than the pure gods, and more accessible than the living Emperor or Empress.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The ever escalating tension of who Teshar (our main character) is and what she did to deserve to be treated like she is is fascinating (especially when you get to the why). I enjoy seeing the magic of the world escalating as we get to the obvious &amp;lsquo;Teshar must save the day&amp;rsquo; conclusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;my mother, bless her kind, silly soul, once pointed out to me that pretty women look like everyone else, whereas beautiful women look like themselves&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Overall, a fun story (that could have been longer). It&amp;rsquo;s always interesting to find a solid self-published and little reviewed work just like this! Worth a try.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Snow Crash</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/28/snow-crash/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/28/snow-crash/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We are all susceptible to the pull of viral ideas. Like mass hysteria. Or a tune that gets into your head that you keep humming all day until you spread it to someone else. Jokes. Urban legends. Crackpot religions. Marxism. No matter how smart we get, there is always this deep irrational part that makes us potential hosts for self-replicating information.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a bit of straight up dystopian cyberpunk, straight out of the 90s. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see the mix of hope and fear when it comes to technology&amp;ndash;virtual realitiies as both a way to dream and a means of control; a patchwork of corporate strongholds, each sovereign in their own right; a nuclear sidecar; a floating city circling the Pacific Ocean. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is America. People do whatever the fuck they feel like doing, you got a problem with that? Because they have a right to. And because they have guns and no one can fucking stop them.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And then add on to that a mix of memes (in the &amp;lsquo;viral/self-propagating idea&amp;rsquo; rather than quickly spreading joke images) and linguistics. The Tower of Babel and ancient Sumerian. &amp;lsquo;Programming&amp;rsquo; the human mind. It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating idea, even if the fine details feel a bit off at times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then characterwise. Oof. Hiro is a nerd power fantasy. He&amp;rsquo;s the best at sword fighting and a world class hacker and always wins.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Also his name (or at least the name he goes by) is Hiro Protagonist. A bit on the nose?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did really enjoy Y.T. though. 15 year old skater courier chick, street surfing and hitching rides on passing cars (etc). She&amp;rsquo;s a fun and high energy&amp;ndash;and it&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird that&amp;rsquo;s she&amp;rsquo;s only 15.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It was, of course, nothing more than sexism, the especially virulent type espoused by male techies who sincerely believe that they are too smart to be sexists.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Overall, a neat story and a decent example of cyberpunk moving into the 90s&amp;ndash;which admittedly I haven&amp;rsquo;t read much of. It&amp;rsquo;s been on my to-read list forever and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have finally read it!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Eyes Are the Best Part</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/28/the-eyes-are-the-best-part/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/28/the-eyes-are-the-best-part/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A salty liquid trickles down my throat. The outside is crunchy cartilage. I jam it into my left cheek and bite down with my molars; jellylike matter explodes within my mouth.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Whelp.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is most definitely a horror book. Not in the &amp;lsquo;jump and scare you&amp;rsquo; sort of vibe or really even the &amp;lsquo;serial killer is coming for you sort. But an ever building sense of what is real and what isn&amp;rsquo;t, body horror, and what-the-heckery? This book has &lt;em>that&lt;/em> in spades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s all built on a foundation of a messy home life going multiple periods of transition all at once. A feeling of alienation. Sexism and racism, sometimes subtle, sometimes &lt;em>not&lt;/em>. Learning to deal with (or not) their changing world(s).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How do I explain to her that the home I miss isn’t a place? It’s a time when my life made sense. When things made sense.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Characterwise, I think Ji-won&amp;rsquo;s point of view did a good job of being just as (eventually) freaked out as the reader is getting as her life gets upended. That, I appreciated. And I really feel for her mother and sister, both before the events of the story and just maybe even more after&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New mother&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend George is&amp;hellip; kind of cartoonish, but dealing with a divorced mother and a man who will say the right things? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s part of the mess of the situation, no?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then new school friends Alexis and Geoffrey. I &amp;hellip; the change with Geoffrey felt like Ji-won reacted before she knew what might be going on there. And perhaps I missed something, but&amp;hellip; he did not deserve everything he got. Which I suppose leads all the more into the horror of it all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Island in the Sea of Time</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/24/island-in-the-sea-of-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/24/island-in-the-sea-of-time/</guid><description>&lt;p>What if the modern day island of Nantucket was transplanted whole and complete 3000 or so years into the past.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty much the entire basis of the setting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From there, you get a book ranging from &amp;lsquo;how do we survive&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;we can&amp;rsquo;t change anything?!&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;how do we stop one of our own from building his own empire and taking over the world&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As one does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The historical basis is pretty interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s not a period I know &lt;em>terribly&lt;/em> much about&amp;ndash;although to be fair, there are a few cultures here that had to be invented mostly whole cloth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like the builders of Stonehenge&amp;ndash;they never wrote anything, so we have only scant records of what they might have been like&amp;ndash;or the writers of Linear A and B (the former only deciphered in the 50s and the latter having not done yet).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But then you have fascinating bits&amp;ndash;like you can&amp;rsquo;t very well trade with the local Native Americans for corn&amp;ndash;it won&amp;rsquo;t spread to this part of the world for thousands of years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The linguistics alone&amp;ndash;learning to speak various languages to various people was particularly interesting to me. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot to go from the idea that modern Lithuanian may be the closest to proto-Indo-European to being able to speak it, but for the sake of the story, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The survival aspects are a combination of &amp;lsquo;go humanity&amp;rsquo; and a bit much at times. The idea that they just so happen to have all the experts they could possibly need&amp;ndash;ancient fishing and farming, blacksmithing, metalurgy, chemistry. Nantucket is not &lt;em>that&lt;/em> big. And lucky they just so happened to bring back the Coast Guard&amp;rsquo;s one large sailing ship with them. But again, it&amp;rsquo;s a story. Everyone trying and then&amp;hellip; just dying out wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be nearly as interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One interesting aspect of the story was that we &lt;em>never&lt;/em> really learn (at least in this first book) &lt;em>why&lt;/em> or &lt;em>how&lt;/em> the island was sent back in time. Are they actually in their own past? Or in some alternate reality? But &amp;hellip; does it really matter? Again, it&amp;rsquo;s a story. The survival and exploring the world as it was is the point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I actually kind of like that we don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>need&lt;/em> to know why any of this happened. Just enjoy the ride. I would like to see how things change over a much longer time period&amp;ndash;but I imagine that&amp;rsquo;s a much harder bit of research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall an interesting book. Quite long. I&amp;rsquo;ll prob ably read the sequels at some point but not at the moment. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Dark Talent</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/23/the-dark-talent/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/23/the-dark-talent/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Some of you have been waiting for years to read this, the final volume of my autobiography.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I cannot really imagine that being the last book. Or at least the last one that would be published for another 6 years! Now, in hindsight, it&amp;rsquo;s obvious (and my kids&amp;rsquo; totally already knew), but man. That&amp;rsquo;s NOT AN ENDING.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Fine,” Grandpa said. “You fetch your evil Librarian mother from the jail. I’ll go warm up the giant penguin!”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Ahem.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Well, that was fun,” Grandpa said as he climbed to his feet. “Anyone dead?”&lt;br>
“Does my pride count?” Draulin asked, dusting herself off.&lt;br>
“I don’t think so,” Grandpa said. “I killed that years ago. Dif, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but shoving my grandson out of planes is usually my job. So next time, kindly refrain until I give the word.”&lt;br>
“Sorry, sir,” Dif said, looking abashed.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The Dark Talent sees Alcatraz. Sans Dark Talent, off on a mission to save the world &amp;hellip; and to save the girl. Just don&amp;rsquo;t let Bastille hear you say that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a lot like the rest of the series. New Smedrys (oh Dif), new worldbuilding (the HIBRARY! Beneath Washington DC!), new schenanigans (that is &lt;em>quite&lt;/em> a library; also, rocket powered penguins), and a big new battle at the end (leading up to that oft forementioned SACRIFICE UPON AN ALTAR OF ENCYCLOPEDIAS).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it&amp;rsquo;s not the ending. And the ending can more than tell you that, which&amp;hellip; is honestly getting kind of old.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s doubly painful since not only did it end quickly, but it also ended painfully. In a series where guns put people in comas and main characters have magic powers seemingly purposely designed (hmm) to get them out of trouble&amp;hellip; well, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a shock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of fun and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to where in the &lt;em>world&lt;/em> the series will &lt;em>actually&lt;/em> end&amp;hellip; For real this time? Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Ruthless Lady's Guide to Wizardry</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/13/the-ruthless-ladys-guide-to-wizardry/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/13/the-ruthless-ladys-guide-to-wizardry/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a fun story (and a great cover and title &amp;#x1f604;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, take a struggling thief/con artist (with a tendency towards fire magic), give her a job bodyguarding a soon to be married young Lady and&amp;hellip; see what happens. There are some crazy fight scenes, a few light plot twists, a skeletal mouse that goes BONG&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and &amp;hellip; perhaps a chance to fall in love&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, man this is quite a cast. We have the Delly&amp;ndash;our protagonist thief that can light things on fire&amp;ndash;but the supporting cast are even better. Winn. A part troll illusionist/brawler&amp;ndash;with quite the accent and past. Mrs. Totham, the &lt;strike>Necromancer&lt;/strike> Body Scientist. The academic. The lady. The mother.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course Buttons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that one for you to discover, but each time I the narrator read &amp;lsquo;Buttons said, “Bong.”&amp;rsquo; I found myself grinning. It&amp;rsquo;s just weird and delightful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Settingwise, it&amp;rsquo;s quasi-Victorian, which is a lot of fun. The language is a bit weird at times, with quite a few unexpected &amp;lsquo;fucks&amp;rsquo; jumping out at you.. but apparently that&amp;rsquo;s about when the term really started to take off and branch out, so&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;her perception of egregious enfucktation in her current, present, and unfortunate familial circumstances&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun setting though, going from the cities you most often see in a Victorian style out into the country and back. I want to see more of this world!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect the &amp;lsquo;protection&amp;rsquo; mission itself to take up such relatively little of the book. It&amp;rsquo;s more an inciting incident than anything, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad for it. When we moved on from that&amp;ndash;I was not at all ready to move on from this book. It&amp;rsquo;s all fairly straight forward (I expected a late book twist that never really materialized).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, that was yet another delight of a book and if anything in this review struck your fancy&amp;ndash;well worth the read!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: This is apparently a sequel of sorts? Oops. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, it&amp;rsquo;s more set in the same world with minor crossovers. But I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to go back and read it now!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Small Miracles</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/11/small-miracles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/11/small-miracles/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Chocolate shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a sin at all. Everyone deserves a bit of chocolate.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Gadriel, a former (now fallen) Guardian Angel owes her angelic bookie&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. And all she has to do to come clear is to tempt one sinless mortal&amp;ndash;Holly Harker. Should be easy, it&amp;rsquo;s what she does now&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So of course wacky hijinks ensue, things go wrong, people get hurt (not badly, it&amp;rsquo;s not that sort of book), and just perhaps&amp;ndash;everyone comes out of it a bit better than they went in.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Believe me, plenty of people claim they love someone because they get the warm fuzzies around them - but love is something you do. Quite often, it&amp;rsquo;s something you choose.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s such a fun reading, reminding me fairly strongly of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/24/good-omens-the-nice-and-accurate-prophecies-of-agnes-nutter-witch/">Good Omens&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Both in theme, but also in style. It&amp;rsquo;s a little bit irreverent, a little bit touching, and a lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Structurally, the near constant footnotes detailing what is/isn&amp;rsquo;t a sin (points, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-good-place/">The Good Place&lt;/a> style) and the running score for Holly and her niece are a lot of fun. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that to work as well in an audiobook as it did, but each time I heard that little chime, I got a little smile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, another good read (on a bit of a run of those!). Well worth a try.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Someone You Can Build a Nest In</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/08/someone-you-can-build-a-nest-in/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/08/someone-you-can-build-a-nest-in/</guid><description>&lt;p>This book is &amp;hellip; a weird mix of horror and romance, cozy and queer and &lt;em>weird&lt;/em> all at once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, your main point of view is this shape shifting monster who eats people&amp;ndash;who the author does &lt;em>quite&lt;/em> a job of making you &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> for, especially as&amp;ndash;between the whole eating people thing&amp;ndash;she ends up finding a family of her own and perhaps even falling in love.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not at all where I would have expected the story to go from just the title and cover (and oh, that is a delightful cover).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It does get a weird bit &amp;lsquo;modern&amp;rsquo; feeling at time, especially when Shesheshen (the monster protagonist) oscilates between having no idea how humans human (I get it, I really do)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner,” Homily said, hand going to her throat through the scarf. “I get self-conscious.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“If you weren’t conscious of yourself, who would you be conscious of?”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;to feeling &lt;em>strongly&lt;/em> about consent quite a number of times.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Then she realized the human woman was waiting for consent. Shesheshen sank more under her witch’s hat, and extended a foot. Once it was offered, Homily patted one of her meaty hands on Shesheshen’s calf. Why was she doing that? And why did it feel pleasant?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a concept worth enforcing, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite shake the feeling that it just didn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit the whole &amp;lsquo;monster who doesn&amp;rsquo;t get humans&amp;rsquo; thing and it jumped out at me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, I love how &amp;lsquo;alien&amp;rsquo; Shesheshen is (when she&amp;rsquo;s not thinking about consent). She doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have a body of her own, building it around whatever she eats (or finds lying around). The descriptions of how she builds around organs and puts them to her own use gets awfully gory at times, but is also a lot of fun to read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s yet another fun read and if you don&amp;rsquo;t mind a bit of gore and a weird horror/romance mix, it&amp;rsquo;s well worth it. None too shabby for a debut! (First novel; Wiswell has a few published shorts)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: I &amp;hellip; did not expect to find this was written by a man.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nine Goblins</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/06/nine-goblins/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/06/nine-goblins/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/t.-kingfisher/">T. Kingfisher&lt;/a> is a lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Smart goblins became mechanics. Dumb goblins became soldiers. Really dumb goblins became officers.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s this delightful little story about a world where Goblins are at war with the Humans and Elves. It&amp;rsquo;s told from the point of view of a ragtag group of Goblins who suddenly find themselves &lt;em>far&lt;/em> behind enemy lines, having to ally themselves with &amp;hellip; a veterinarian of all things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s quite a funny book; the humor reminds me a lot of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/discworld/">Discworld&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;take that as the compliment it is. I love reading about all the goblins. They are most &lt;em>certainly&lt;/em> a wacky bunch of characters&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Wherever a goblin happens to live, he complains about it constantly. This is actually a sign of affection. A desert goblin will complain endlessly about the beastly heat and the dreadful dryness and the spiky cactus. He will show you how his sunburn is peeling and the place where the rattlesnake bit him and the place where he bit the rattlesnake. He will be thoroughly, cheerfully, miserable.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh, and of course the teddy bear&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The bear not only had a set of stripes sewn on his arm, it was possibly the first teddy-bear in history to have received a medal for service to the elven nation.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And the contrast of an Elven veterinarian, getting into all the dirty, messy, ugly things vets have to do (when Elves normally only concern themselves with that which is fair beautiful and true) is great fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a quick read (147 pages) and well worth the fun. Give it a try!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Orconomics</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/orconomics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/orconomics/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Not all who wander are lost; some are on quests.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That was a very strange book. More than anything, it felt like &amp;lsquo;what if all of the more &lt;em>game&lt;/em> parts of Dungeons and Dragons were real, what would that change about the world?&amp;rsquo;. Oh, and dig into the economics of it along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We literally have an adventuring industry with heroes funded by corporate interests buying stakes in the eventual loot. Some sort of &amp;rsquo;level&amp;rsquo; system where you can turn in records of kills for advancement. Noncombat Paper Carries (NPCs).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a D&amp;amp;D satire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the biggest weakness to me was more one of expectations. I actually expected it to go even more into the economics (that don&amp;rsquo;t really make &lt;em>any&lt;/em> sense) of a adventuring based society. It&amp;rsquo;s there, but it could have been so much more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, I did enjoy the book, it was a fun read and the sense of humor was on point. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to check out the sequels at some point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Robogenesis</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/robogenesis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/robogenesis/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And now the story begins for the last time.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So. That hint that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t all over? That was just the beginning.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We are all expressions of our own minds, projected onto the world.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The idea that the AI that lead to the end of the world wasn&amp;rsquo;t a unique event&amp;ndash;just one that happened to go particularly sideways is a fascinating one. The story of people trying to rebuild in the ruins&amp;ndash;only for another war to sweep over what&amp;rsquo;s left is terrifying. And the &amp;lsquo;what comes next&amp;rsquo; of animal like machines, augmented humans, and self-aware / free robots is a fascinating basis for a story.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What is a mind, but a pattern? My mind or yours. Man or machine. Simply an arrangement of atoms. Each of us, a unique expression of the mind of the universe.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Honestly, I still think that &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/robopocalypse/">Robopocalypse&lt;/a> could stand as it&amp;rsquo;s own&amp;ndash;and was the stronger book. But if it had to have a sequel, this was an interesting one. Now that we have it (and that I&amp;rsquo;ve read it!) I feel like we&amp;rsquo;re going to need at least one more. There are just so many ideas here, we need to go another step further!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But instead of the end, I’m pretty sure I found myself at the start of something.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hanging Tree</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/28/the-hanging-tree/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/28/the-hanging-tree/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Jeremy Beaumont-Jones had been lucky enough to be born rich. He wasn’t in the mad oligarch class but once you’re past a certain point, the sheer weight of your money sucks in wealth like a financial singularity. If you’re sensible enough not to blow it on race horses, cocaine or musical theatre, then it becomes a perpetual-motion money making machine.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The power of money&amp;ndash;and those with power of their own, which tends to lead to money in it&amp;rsquo;s own ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Peter getting caught right up to it, a favor called in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a whole mess of the posh/upper class world of London and all the problems that come with this&amp;ndash;and how much they expect to be able to pay their way out of anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It took the Fire Brigade a day and a half to secure the remains of the house enough to recover Crew Cut’s body, which was described by Dr Jennifer Vaughan as ‘suffering from crush trauma’ and by Dr Walid as ‘mostly flat’.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well. Almost anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoy seeing more of Guleed, both in her role as a cop but also her getting more into the magical world&amp;ndash;at least by proxy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see more of Lesley. That&amp;rsquo;s such a mess throughout all of these books&amp;ndash;and I really don&amp;rsquo;t know where we&amp;rsquo;re going from there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And to finally face off more literally face to face with the Faceless Man? Awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The plots and sudden resolutions continue in this book. At this point, I&amp;rsquo;m mostly used to it&amp;hellip; but only mostly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Once the telephone had been invented, it was only a matter of time before the police got in on the new technology and, first in Glasgow and then in London, the police box was born. Here a police officer in need of assistance could find a telephone link to Scotland Yard, a dry space to do “paperwork” and, in certain extreme cases, a life of adventure through space and time.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s delightful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Robopocalypse</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/27/robopocalypse/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/27/robopocalypse/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I can only give you words. Nothing fancy. But this will have to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you&amp;rsquo;re reading it a year from now or a hundred years from now. By the end of the chronicle you will know that humanity carried the flame of knowledge into the terrible blackness of the unknown, to the very brink of annihilation. And we carried it back.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In the near future, thinking machines are even slightly more everywhere than they are now. Take it one step further along the road to true general AI&amp;hellip; and suddenly you go outright Skynet on the world. Robot Apocalypse. Get it?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The true knowledge is not &lt;em>in&lt;/em> the things, but in finding the connections &lt;em>between&lt;/em> the things.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This &amp;hellip; was perhaps not the best time to read this book, with the ever increasing advances in LLMs and chatbots leading to upheaval in all manner of fields of work, along with the current instability (to put it mildly) in the United States. I think I need more stability in books right now.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>To survive, humans will work together. Accept each other. For a moment, we are all equal. Backs against the wall, human beings are at their finest.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That being said, it was a fascinatingly structured book. From the very first chapter, we know humanity (or what&amp;rsquo;s left of it) eventually wins the war. Each chapter, we have comments like &amp;rsquo;this is the last record of X&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Y had a part to play yet&amp;rsquo; And as we go, the various plots cross and come together, sketching out the end of the world and what comes after.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I will murder you by the billions to give you immortality. I will set fire to your civilization to light your way forward. But know this: My species is not defined by your dying, but by your living.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating book and I think well worth the read&amp;hellip; and I&amp;rsquo;m curious where exactly the sequel can possibly go next without more of the same.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alcatraz Versus the Shattered Lens</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/26/alcatraz-versus-the-shattered-lens/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/26/alcatraz-versus-the-shattered-lens/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Impossible things are really rough to do, you know.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And man, Alcatraz does all manner of impossible things this time around. There&amp;rsquo;s wacky tech (like Teddy bear grenades and giant flying bats (not made of glass)), wacky situations (Alcatraz getting a major (temporary) promotion (of sorts)), and powers (a Talent for Being Bad at Math). Pretty much exactly what you&amp;rsquo;d expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And all along, we&amp;rsquo;re getting more about the world building, one thing that I always enjoy in Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s books. There definitely seems to be a connection between it all&amp;ndash;but exactly how it all works together and how that can make things go wrong&amp;hellip; well, that&amp;rsquo;s the story, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Structurally, my kids were absolutely thrilled by the chapter numbering. The books are terribly meta, referring to chapters that don&amp;rsquo;t exist (because of skipping numbers) and with notes and comments going back and forth. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to read and honestly kind of impressive that we&amp;rsquo;ve gone this far&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
