My original goal was to finish all 25 books on the Book Bingo card, every one of them on hardmode. With two exceptions, I made it (see below). You can click any book to read my review:
2021 Book Bingo Attack on Titan, Vol. 1 (Hard Mode)
5 SFF Short Stories (Hard: An entire anthology or collection)
The Poppy War (Hard Mode)
Set in Asia (Hard: by an Asian author)</description></item><item><title>2021 Reading Retrospective</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/2021-reading-retrospective/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 23:59:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/2021-reading-retrospective/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well. That was a year. Covid, take 2. A new job. A new baby. I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite make my 200 books this year (I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite even make it to 1/2 days), but that&amp;rsquo;s okay. I still read a giant pile. :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some stats:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>179 books read: 1 every 2.04 days (almost!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>47,236 pages read: roughly 130 pages/day&lt;/li>
&lt;li>29 audiobooks, 96 graphic novels, 18 children&amp;rsquo;s chapter books, 18 non-fiction&lt;/li>
&lt;li>56 unique authors (top were Hajime Isayama, Patricia Briggs, Warren Ellis, and Neil Gaiman)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>19 series (top were Attack on Titan, Mercy Thompson/Alpha &amp;amp; Omega, Sandman, and Runelords)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Shortest: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/21/the-shepherds-tale/">The Shepherd's Tale&lt;/a> with 56 pages, longest: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/the-holy-bible-revised-standard-version-catholic-edition/">The Holy Bible: Revised Standard Version, Catholic Edition&lt;/a> with over 1000. That feels like cheating though, so let&amp;rsquo;s go with &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/21/rhythm-of-war/">Rhythm of War&lt;/a> at 1270 / &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/12/crafting-interpreters/">Crafting Interpreters&lt;/a> at 865. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most read book I read this year was &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/23/1984/">1984&lt;/a> with 5 million others reading it (on Goodreads alone; I was working on my earliest backlog). Least popular: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/26/tales-of-nezura-book-1-the-zevolra/">Tales of Nezura: Book 1: The Zevolra&lt;/a> with only 39. It &amp;hellip; wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad. Give it a try?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I gave 119 five-star ratings, 45 four-star, 7 three-star, and less than 10 other ratings. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the realization over the last year that I tend to like just about everything. Books in particular, they&amp;rsquo;re only on my list if I think I&amp;rsquo;d find them interesting, so of course, they&amp;rsquo;ll be rated highly&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not bad.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 9: Critical Mass</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/hellblazer-vol.-9-critical-mass/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/hellblazer-vol.-9-critical-mass/</guid><description>Two big stories, a few really trippy dreams, and Constantine managing to push off damnation a bit longer. A neat collection. Critical Mass in particular is worth the read.
Mini reviews (spoilers):

I did however, read the entire Bible this year (for the second time, first time with the additional Catholic books). This time around, guided by the excellent Bible in a Year podcast hosted by Fr. Mike Schmitz.
Over the course of the year, it goes through every single book in the Bible in a fairly well thought out order&amp;ndash;which certainly does make you realize just how much more of the Old Testament there is&amp;hellip; (For context, the OT is 3x as long as the NT.</description></item><item><title>Clap When You Land</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/29/clap-when-you-land/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/29/clap-when-you-land/</guid><description>I was raised so damn Dominican Spanish my first language

For one, the first real &amp;lsquo;binding of worlds&amp;rsquo; happens fairly early in the book. In a nutshell, that means that any character alive in both worlds is now a mix of memories, experiences, et al of both characters, while those only in one are initially weaker for it.</description></item><item><title>Pippi in the South Seas</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/12/pippi-in-the-south-seas/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/12/pippi-in-the-south-seas/</guid><description>Cute enough. For the most part, it&amp;rsquo;s more Pippi stories, but they do finally get out of the town and go with Pippi and her father to the South Seas island where her father is king. Which&amp;hellip; is both the best and worst part of the book. It&amp;rsquo;s zany and fun in true Pippi fashion, but it&amp;rsquo;s also horribly imperialistic/racist. It&amp;rsquo;s still a fun book, but definitely a product of the times.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 8: Rake at the Gates of Hell</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/09/hellblazer-vol.-8-rake-at-the-gates-of-hell/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/09/hellblazer-vol.-8-rake-at-the-gates-of-hell/</guid><description>There was a lot of potential in this episode, with two longer storylines&amp;ndash;one the continuation of the angels/devil storyline we&amp;rsquo;ve been dealing with for a while. But unfortunately, outside of a few very cool/trippy visuals it was a surprisingly quiet volume. A lot of human trouble, not enough supernatural craziness. Less moping at least, but without a real transition (at least in my opinion). Not terrible, but certainly one of the weaker entries in the series.</description></item><item><title>An Alchemy of Masques and Mirrors</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/08/an-alchemy-of-masques-and-mirrors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/08/an-alchemy-of-masques-and-mirrors/</guid><description>Well that was delightful. One of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;m really glad for the 2021 Book Bingo. I don&amp;rsquo;t know when/if I would have found this book, if not for that, and I really quite enjoyed it. It&amp;rsquo;s got great steampunky worldbuilding (with some hints of body horror I honestly feel steampunk should probably have more of), royal/courtly intrigue, wonderful characters, and some delightful writing (with a French twist to the word choices that I don&amp;rsquo;t see much of).</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 7: Tainted Love</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/07/hellblazer-vol.-7-tainted-love/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/07/hellblazer-vol.-7-tainted-love/</guid><description>Another solid volume. In particular, there&amp;rsquo;s another volume about angels/demons/and the troubles they get into. It&amp;rsquo;s not quite as good as the one in Hellblazer, Vol. 6: Bloodlines, but still enjoyable. An interesting take on Gabriel, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure.

A couple of great longer storylines with long term consequences (Guys &amp;amp; Dolls was great) and a few shorter one offs (Lord of the Dance in particular I enjoyed). Could have been longer, but there’s still potentially more story to be told there.
I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying seeing Constantine and Kit&amp;rsquo;s relationship evolve. It gives a nice human element to contrast the horror. I only hope that doesn&amp;rsquo;t go too badly for her in the long run&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Writing An Interpreter In Go</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/03/writing-an-interpreter-in-go/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/03/writing-an-interpreter-in-go/</guid><description>You know, I&amp;rsquo;m always up for a good &amp;lsquo;writing an interpreter&amp;rsquo; book. Making programming languages is a thing I&amp;rsquo;ve done a number of times before and really have been itching to get back into again. Add to that a desire to pick up a bit more Go syntax&amp;hellip; well, perhaps this book is just about perfect.
In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;lsquo;writing an interpreter&amp;rsquo; book. They go through lexing, parsing, and evaluating.</description></item><item><title>The Winter King</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/28/the-winter-king/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/28/the-winter-king/</guid><description>ONCE UPON A TIME, in a land that was called Britain, these things happened.
This is an odd one to review. It&amp;rsquo;s well written, decently paced (although I found it slow in general), and&amp;ndash;so far as I know&amp;ndash;well researched for the time period. On the other hand, I tend strongly to prefer fantasy and science fiction (which this is not, despite all the hints at the contrary) and a little more action.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 5: Dangerous Habits</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/23/hellblazer-vol.-5-dangerous-habits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/23/hellblazer-vol.-5-dangerous-habits/</guid><description>Weird, slow, and dark at first but then we get the Deadly Habits storyline. That’s one of the core Constantine storylines so far as I know and for good reason.
The Bogeyman Oh Constantine. What is going on with you. Dark and depressing and little happening. Sets up a story I suppose.
Dead-Boy’s Heart That’s a great issue. Took me a bit to realize it was typing Constantine. So he’s always been … a little different.</description></item><item><title>Holy Sister</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/21/holy-sister/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/21/holy-sister/</guid><description>All leaves must fall in time, she had said. The lives we lived fall away from us, but something remains, something that is part of the tree.
That one actually took me rather a while to get through. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, the worldbuilding is still facinating, the action is top notch, and we still get more than a bunch of all the main characters. But somehow&amp;ndash;it seems to have lost it&amp;rsquo;s focus.</description></item><item><title>Pippi Goes on Board</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/19/pippi-goes-on-board/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/19/pippi-goes-on-board/</guid><description>I actually liked this story a lot more than the first Pippi. It&amp;rsquo;s still basically the same idea: girl who is unusually strong and lives on her own gets up to hijinks, but I think that the stories this time around fit a little bit&amp;ndash;and we actually get to meet Pippi's dad--turns out he's not dead after all .
Worth continuing on. Going to have to check out the third now.</description></item><item><title>Sons of the Oak</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/18/sons-of-the-oak/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/18/sons-of-the-oak/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sons of the Oak is an odd one. After saving the world in Lair of Bones, Gaborn and Iome are loaded with enough metabolism to curse them to die in the next few years&amp;ndash;which ends up happening relatively early on. That of course leaves a power vacuum. There are those who would love to see the Earth King&amp;rsquo;s son take the crown&amp;ndash;and just as many who&amp;rsquo;d rather see him dead and take power of their on. On top of that, there&amp;rsquo;s a whole new level of darkness in the world. From Loci to strengi-saats, it&amp;rsquo;s an ever darkening world, with the Torch of Humanity having been passed down to the next generation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve actually finished this book before. The time skip made it hard to read and I just moved on. But this time around, I&amp;rsquo;ve actually really enjoyed it. We&amp;rsquo;ll have to see how it continues. I think reading it as an audiobook has helped. It just keeps going unless you actually stop rather than stopping unless you push on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 4: The Family Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/07/hellblazer-vol.-4-the-family-man/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/07/hellblazer-vol.-4-the-family-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>Better than Volume 3 by a long shot. Starts weird but interesting and gets better from there. I’ll reiterate though that I can’t really imagine buying these by issue, especially in real time. A volume has enough meat to it to sustain a storyline.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Lair of Bones</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/04/the-lair-of-bones/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/04/the-lair-of-bones/</guid><description>The Lair of Bones is an epic and fitting conclusion1 to the Runeslords saga. It takes the story of Gaborn and Raj Ahten, of Runelords and reavers, of elemental powers and far darker things, and brings it all together in a series of rather epic journeys and battles, culminating with an epic&amp;ndash;if bittersweet&amp;ndash;victory of light over dark, of good over evil.
Or does it?
Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a solid conclusion and I quite enjoyed it.</description></item><item><title>Pippi Longstocking</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/03/pippi-longstocking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/03/pippi-longstocking/</guid><description>Pippi Longstocking&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an odd character. On one hand, she&amp;rsquo;s a fun loving young girl who happens to have super strength (for some reason). She&amp;rsquo;s lived a pretty crazy life and has stories from all over the world along with a tendency to get herself into (and back out of) wacky adventures and always seems to have a lot of fun doing so.
On the other hand, she&amp;rsquo;s a young girl living on her own.</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 3: The Fear Machine</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/01/hellblazer-vol.-3-the-fear-machine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/01/hellblazer-vol.-3-the-fear-machine/</guid><description>Not terrible, but also not great. It starts very slowly with a hippie commune and takes a few issues to get going and gets downright weird at a few points. But enjoyable enough after that.
Onward!
Issue specific reviews, spoilers:
Touching the Earth Oh boy.
And then it goes all weird hippy commune. Sure? I don’t really get it. Imagine paying for this as a single issue…
Shepherd’s Warning Well, it’s more of the same story, but there’s potential at least!</description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 2: The Devil You Know</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/23/hellblazer-vol.-2-the-devil-you-know/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/23/hellblazer-vol.-2-the-devil-you-know/</guid><description>Well that’s a ride. The continuation of the Swamp Thing sexy times storyline, some more backstory on how Constantine got to be how he is, Constantine all Arthurian (for some reason), and a straight up horror story.
Weaker than volume 1 but worth continuing to volume 3!
Sex and Death Starts where we left off, with Constantine out of body and the Swamp Thing doing his mating thing… That is not a plot line I care at all about.</description></item><item><title>Grey Sister</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/21/grey-sister/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/21/grey-sister/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>NONA GREY RAISES her head and regards her foe through midnight eyes. Perhaps
it is just the reflection of the torchlight but somewhere in their darkness
a red flame seems to burn. “I am my own cage.” She lifts her sword. “And I
have opened the door.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In a nutshell, Mr. Popper is an orderinary enough man who happens to absolutely love stories about Arctic/Antarctic expeditions. He writes a letter to Admiral Drake and&amp;hellip; gets a penguin shipped to him. One thing leads to another, he gets another penguin, they have an unusually large pile of chicks, and they go on the road.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 1: Original Sins</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/14/hellblazer-vol.-1-original-sins/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/14/hellblazer-vol.-1-original-sins/</guid><description>&lt;p>I really do have a thing for urban fantasy specifically dealing with demons and angels, good and evil, especially if it twists it all around. Constantine does that in spades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I watched the 2005 film well before I knew it was based on a comic (so sue me), so Keanu Reeves is forever going to be stuck in my head as the true Constantine, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also watched just about all of the new wave of DC shows, including the 2014 version of Constantine plus his appearances on Legends of Tomorrow. Not quite the same, but I still loved the character.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dark Lord of the Sith, Vol. 4: Fortress Vader</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/06/dark-lord-of-the-sith-vol.-4-fortress-vader/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/06/dark-lord-of-the-sith-vol.-4-fortress-vader/</guid><description>&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of interesting world building in this one, from a mask inhabited by a Sith Ghost (more or less; something we could use more of now that we know how often the Jedi do this), portals to a possible world beyond death, more hunting down Jedi, and Vader&amp;rsquo;s fortress&amp;ndash;which I barely remember as a thing anyways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a solid volume, but not quite up to the level as what came before. Still worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dark Lord of the Sith, Vol. 3: The Burning Seas</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/04/dark-lord-of-the-sith-vol.-3-the-burning-seas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/04/dark-lord-of-the-sith-vol.-3-the-burning-seas/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating addition. It takes what we&amp;rsquo;ve already been seeing&amp;ndash; Vader solidifying his power in the time between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope&amp;ndash;and takes us to the Mon Cala system, home of Admiral Ackbar. And yes, it is in fact a trap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating way to expand a bit of the Star Wars universe I at least didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about, getting a bit of the tension between two different intelligent life forms on one planet (which I suppose we&amp;rsquo;ve also seen on Naboo) and fleshing out a race we&amp;rsquo;ve only seen a little about before. All from the point of view of our favorite black suited, heaving breathing menace.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dark Lord of the Sith, Vol. 2: Legacy's End</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/03/dark-lord-of-the-sith-vol.-2-legacys-end/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/03/dark-lord-of-the-sith-vol.-2-legacys-end/</guid><description>&lt;p>Vader&amp;rsquo;s goal this time?&lt;/p>

We&amp;rsquo;re heading towards the conclusion of this particular story arc. I really do like this length. 4 volumes has about as much oomph as a novel length story, albeit with a much higher concentration of pretty* pictures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that being said, Vader is making his way back into Palpatine&amp;rsquo;s good (bad?) graces&amp;ndash;but he now truly understands how the Sith work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 3: The Shu-Torun War</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/01/darth-vader-vol.-3-the-shu-torun-war/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/10/01/darth-vader-vol.-3-the-shu-torun-war/</guid><description>&lt;p>Okay, now this went a bit sideways.

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m of an age where I didn&amp;rsquo;t catch the original trilogy in theaters, instead watching it over and over again on VHS. When the prequels came out, I absolutely went to see them over and over in theaters (they&amp;rsquo;re not great, but they&amp;rsquo;re not as bad as they&amp;rsquo;ve been made out to be). Now more recently the new trilogy&amp;ndash;well, I suppose I should finish those.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Lion to Guard Us</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/09/28/a-lion-to-guard-us/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/09/28/a-lion-to-guard-us/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure what to think about &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="945210" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/945210.a-lion-to-guard-us"> A Lion to Guard Us &lt;/a> . It&amp;rsquo;s historical fiction: the story of three young children in London and later on a journey to the new world. The children never existed, but a lot of the events that that happened either could have happened (their life in London) or in a general (the &lt;em>Sea Adventure&lt;/em> was a real ship and the problems with it&amp;rsquo;s journey and Jamestown are real history).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the most part, it&amp;rsquo;s a depressing story. The children&amp;rsquo;s father is an ocean away, their mother is sick ( &lt;span class="spoiler">and dies, to little surprise for older readers&lt;/span>
), the family taking care of them is exploitive, their stand in father figure &lt;span class="spoiler">also eventually dies&lt;/span>
, and they &lt;span class="spoiler">get shipwrecked&lt;/span>
. On the other hand, I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s a good way to teach the idea of &amp;rsquo;no matter what life throws at you, just keep on keeping on'?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Locke &amp; Key, Vol. 6: Alpha &amp; Omega</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/09/28/locke-key-vol.-6-alpha-omega/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/09/28/locke-key-vol.-6-alpha-omega/</guid><description>&lt;p>One more story.&lt;/p>

Which makes Harrow the Ninth all the harder to read&amp;ndash;and especially review. This is going to be one of the most spoilery reviews I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s necessary. If you don&amp;rsquo;t do spoilers: read the book. It&amp;rsquo;s worth it. But it&amp;rsquo;s going to be weird and confusing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. There is an absolute boatload to love about this book. The worldbuilding is still a fascinating combination of sci-fi and gothic (literally necromancers in space). The wording is still wonderful and weird and funny.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mercy Watson: Something Wonky This Way Comes</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/09/07/mercy-watson-something-wonky-this-way-comes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/09/07/mercy-watson-something-wonky-this-way-comes/</guid><description>&lt;p>After &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="37189" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37189.mercy-watson-goes-for-a-ride">Mercy Watson Goes for a Ride&lt;/a>, I figured I should probably write about one of the shorter Mercy Watson stories that I really do like. &lt;a data-goodreads-type="book" data-goodreads-id="6305996" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6305996.mercy-watson-something-wonky-this-way-comes">Mercy Watson: Something Wonky This Way Comes&lt;/a> is that story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, the entire gang goes to a drive in movie, wherein Bottomless Buckets of popcorn, absolutely drenched in butter are served. Of course Mercy goes off to find the butter (as is often the plot) and chaos ensues. We get to see just about everyone, which is all sorts of fun trying to read aloud with a distinct voice per character (as I do) and in the end, all is well.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
