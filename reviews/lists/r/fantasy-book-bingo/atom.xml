Much more breathing room last year than the year before (two weeks!) and I&amp;rsquo;ve already been reading more this year, so I&amp;rsquo;m confident. Let&amp;rsquo;s do it.
As a side note, if anyone I know wants to read along on any of these, drop me a line. Love to chat about books. ðŸ˜„

Must be speculative fiction (SF, fantasy, horror with speculative elements) Limit the number of novellas (fewer than 40k words or defined by the author as such) or combine them A book of short stories counts Graphic novels/manga should be treated as novellas Web novels count (if they&amp;rsquo;re long enough) Audiobooks count Official thread</description></item><item><title>2022 Book Bingo Retrospective</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/13/2022-book-bingo-retrospective/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/13/2022-book-bingo-retrospective/</guid><description>BINGO!

I barely made it, but there were so many books that I absolutely ended up loving that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I otherwise would have read. So this year, better!
