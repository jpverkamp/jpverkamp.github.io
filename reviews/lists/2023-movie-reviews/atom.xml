It just wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of the Disney movies we ever had.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which is a bit of a bummer, since that&amp;rsquo;s quite a good time! Better late than never though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wakanda Forever</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/wakanda-forever/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/wakanda-forever/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How?&lt;br>
How is never as important as why.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So. How do you fill the giant Chadwick Boseman shaped hole in the MCU?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently&amp;hellip; with funeral services, Atlantis (but not), mer-Hermes (the first self described mutant in the MCU), and&amp;ndash;eventually&amp;ndash;someone new to take up the mantle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; fine?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were certainly some pretty spectacular action scenes. The under water scenes are pretty&amp;ndash;even if they only sort of make sense. The character and costume design continues to impress. And there are giant piles of funeral services and mourning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, the sudden introduction of an entire (large) underwater civilization feels&amp;hellip; weird. And as we&amp;rsquo;ve had before with the Marvel movies, some of the big battle set pieces don&amp;rsquo;t make that much sense. They&amp;rsquo;re going out on a boat to fight water people. All to&amp;hellip; limit how many fighters they have to film? And then all but like ten people die and we&amp;rsquo;re just okay with that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s about the middle of the road so far as Marvel movies go for me. Pretty good, decent action, but there have been better entries. Pretty high up for 2023, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably more because I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen that many movies this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Winnie the Pooh: A Very Merry Pooh Year</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/winnie-the-pooh-a-very-merry-pooh-year/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/winnie-the-pooh-a-very-merry-pooh-year/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s Winnie the Pooh&amp;ndash;but now at Christmas time! Not sure how much else there is to say.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I so remember the old Winnie the Pooh &amp;amp; Christmas Too (from 1991). Man the nostalgia when the bugs (and their Napoleabug leader) sound the charge. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know when I would have watched it, but I remember that part!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s cute. The kids enjoyed it. It&amp;rsquo;s probably not something I&amp;rsquo;d ever choose to watch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Logan</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/17/logan/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/17/logan/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I finally got to watch Logan.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Laura: You are dying. You want to die.&lt;br>
Logan: How do you know?&lt;br>
Laura: Charles told me.&lt;br>
Logan: What else did he tell you?&lt;br>
Laura: To not let you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a gritty, brutal sort of R rating that really lets you see the darker side of what a world with superpowers could be&amp;ndash;without the twisted sort of humor that Deadpool has to take the edge off. The action is quick. It&amp;rsquo;s bloody. And they &amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t hold back. It&amp;rsquo;s not the sort of superhero movie that you may always want to see, but I think that it&amp;rsquo;s one worth watching. At least once.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/29/sweeney-todd-the-demon-barber-of-fleet-street/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/29/sweeney-todd-the-demon-barber-of-fleet-street/</guid><description>Wow. I have just not watched many movies this year. I really should work on that.
So let&amp;rsquo;s start with one of the weirdest and violent musicals out there: Sweeney Todd. I recently came across a YouTube video How the Music Spoils Sweeney Todd (and why that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing) that reminded me how much I enjoyed the music when we did it in high school (Not even kidding, not sure how that got approved&amp;hellip;).</description></item><item><title>Lady and the Tramp</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/07/lady-and-the-tramp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/07/lady-and-the-tramp/</guid><description>That&amp;rsquo;s a cute little movie. I think if you&amp;rsquo;re going to do the dog thing, I would strongly prefer {{crosslink &amp;ldquo;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&amp;rdquo;}}. Better music, decent story. Could be that I watched the latter far more.
But characterwise, I did enjoy the contrast between the titular Lady and the Tramp and it&amp;rsquo;s a nice enough story. Stylistically, I enjoy the city and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to not really see the human characters (it&amp;rsquo;s a dog movie after all.</description></item></channel></rss>
