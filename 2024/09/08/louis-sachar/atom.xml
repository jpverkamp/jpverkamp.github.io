&lt;p>This book contains thirty stories about the children and teachers at Wayside School. But before we get to them, there is something you ought to know so that you donâ€™t get confused.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wayside School was accidentally built sideways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was supposed to be only one story high, with thirty classrooms all in a row.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead it is thirty stories high, with one classroom on each story. The builder said he was very sorry.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
