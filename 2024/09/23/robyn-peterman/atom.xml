Except&amp;hellip; the plot is weak, the world building is lazy, and the romance doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>really&lt;/em> make sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the book sums itself up well.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Oh God, Daisy,” ***** said, letting her head fall to her chest. “You have it all wrong.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Have what wrong?” I asked as a feeling of dread washed over me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Every good story has a major plot twist,” she said slowly, growing more agitated with each word.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is on page &lt;em>155&lt;/em> of 164. Daisy (our MC) is finally &lt;em>finally&lt;/em> learning&amp;hellip; and still got it wrong. And it&amp;rsquo;s not even (in my opinion) that sensible a plot twist. And then the book ends. It&amp;rsquo;s very much set up for a sequel; without which, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really stand alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; despite this being an oddly well reviewed book in general, it&amp;rsquo;s just really &lt;em>not&lt;/em> my cup of tea. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;d like it more. Perhaps it gets better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
