I enjoyed it, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying each book in the series a little less.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first book, the kids were brilliant and that was the core of the story. They could think their way out of any wacky mystery they get into. Here, we have Constance literally reading minds and Reynie with his sixth sense for danger. Sticky with his perfect memory, reading just &amp;hellip; everything in the house. Even Kate&amp;rsquo;s magical bucket&amp;ndash;nah, I still enjoy that one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, there was a lot of action and for the most part, the kids are still working their way out of trouble all by themselves&amp;ndash;even when a rescue is under way&amp;ndash;and I enjoyed that. The plot itself didn&amp;rsquo;t go to quite as adventurous destinations as the first two, which I missed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still do really enjoy the found family aspects of the story on all levels. The kids themselves are great together and there are some really humorous points. And they&amp;rsquo;re extended family all together, especially with Mr. Benedict, I really did enjoy that. They do get quite the sense of closure towards the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although there&amp;rsquo;s apparently a 4th and a prequel, I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to move on to something else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Perilous Journey</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/10/the-mysterious-benedict-society-and-the-perilous-journey/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/10/the-mysterious-benedict-society-and-the-perilous-journey/</guid><description>&lt;p>Man those are long books. &amp;#x1f604; Enjoyable though.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>May your adventures bring you closer together, even as they take you far away from home.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Kate is delightful, I like seeing her growing relationship with Milligan. Constance seems to becoming slightly psychic, albeit in a way that they brush off as being very aware of the world and good at pattern matching. Sticky is more self aware while still being a wonderful brain about it all. And Reynie is growing into a solid natural leader. He already had it coming, but it&amp;rsquo;s still good to see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s less contained than the first book. Rather than mostly taking place in one place, it&amp;rsquo;s more of a kidnap/mysterious plot that ends up traveling a chunk of the world. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice change of pace, even if it feels a little contrived to get the kids on their own again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Mysterious Benedict Society</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/02/the-mysterious-benedict-society/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/02/the-mysterious-benedict-society/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that took a while to read. I read it outloud, part of a chapter a night many nights, and it still took a few months. Glad I did it though, it&amp;rsquo;s a great book, especially for kids, but even more so to read aloud with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a story about a group of children, each lost and/or alone in different ways, each brilliant (as the first section and a series of tests shows both to them and to us) and thus necessary for a &lt;em>SECRET MISSION&lt;/em>. I won&amp;rsquo;t go much more into that, but once they get out on the mission and have to prove that they are more than up to the task&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
