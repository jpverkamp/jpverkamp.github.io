Biggest negative: I&amp;rsquo;d totally forgotten this is a part one / to be continued. That was&amp;hellip; not fun to find out right at the end with no current release date for the next sequel!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a great film. I love seeing more of Miles and Gwen, especially a couple of years later. I love the introduction to even more Spider-People (and not-people even, oh Peter Parkedcar) and the introduction of even more multiverse concepts that brings to mind. And the idea that there are fixed points in each Spider&amp;rsquo;s story that makes them who they are is great fuel, both for this and I hope the eventual sequel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Visually, this story once again shines. I love seeing all the different styles, especially when you have more than one on screen at once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now, on seeing this, I learn that Marvel 2099 with more Miguel O&amp;rsquo;Hara is a thing. I should read that next!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward! (And hopefully not too long to a sequel.)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
