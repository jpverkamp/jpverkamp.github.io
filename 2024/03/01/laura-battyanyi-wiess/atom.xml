Not my favorite when they showed up in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/12/the-suspicion/">The Suspicion&lt;/a>, not much better now. At least it&amp;rsquo;s only their tech though&amp;ndash;the ability to track morphing energy&amp;hellip; and the blue box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An interesting enough plot, but there&amp;rsquo;s a spoilery twist (see below) that &amp;hellip; I just didn&amp;rsquo;t think worked. it didn&amp;rsquo;t quite work with the established world building and I doubt will be used again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Conspiracy</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/25/the-conspiracy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/25/the-conspiracy/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an odd one to pair with &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/24/the-reunion/">The Reunion&lt;/a>. In both cases, we have an Animorph with a family member controller. In both cases, it&amp;rsquo;s too close to home. But Marco made the call&amp;ndash;even if it&amp;rsquo;s going to tear him up later to do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now it&amp;rsquo;s Jake&amp;rsquo;s turn.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You know what Marco and I used to talk about? Whether Batman could beat Spiderman. Whether Sega was better than Nintendo. Whether some girl would rather go out with him or me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now . . .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What are we, anymore, Marco? What has happened to us?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He didn&amp;rsquo;t answer. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect him to. We both knew what had happened.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Man these books get dark.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s one reason I like them. They don&amp;rsquo;t get into everything, but they really do get into enough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Exposed</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/16/the-exposed/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/16/the-exposed/</guid><description>&lt;p>Erek&amp;rsquo;s glitching.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which&amp;ndash;if the Yeerks find out there have been highly advanced androids infiltrating them for years&amp;ndash;could be bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;How about his face? A mask?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jake ran to snatch up some full-head masks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I have Clinton, Gingrich, and a Teletubby. Dipsy, I think.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not Dipsy,&amp;rdquo; Cassie corrected. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s Tinky Winky. Dipsy&amp;rsquo;s green and has the straight up thing. Tinky Winky&amp;rsquo;s the one with the triangle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Who&amp;rsquo;s the little red one?&amp;gt; Marco wondered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Po,&amp;rdquo; Cassie said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Oh, yeah.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No offense,&amp;rdquo; Erek said, &amp;ldquo;but how on Earth have you people managed to avoid getting caught for this long?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I mean, he has a point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now the Animorphs have to go somewhere they&amp;rsquo;ve never gone before&amp;ndash;deep, &lt;em>deep&lt;/em> in the ocean. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/05/the-message/">The Message&lt;/a> was nothing compared to this. They&amp;rsquo;re going to need all new morphs this time around.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Calamari,&amp;rdquo; she said with a grin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Snails?&amp;rdquo; I said, frowning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;I am not in favor of snails,&amp;gt; Ax said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Wait, that&amp;rsquo;s not-&amp;rdquo; Cassie said loudly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;I had the misfortune to inadvertently eat one while feeding,&amp;gt; Ax continued. &lt;I did not see it in time. I stepped on it and digested it.>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You ate a snail through your hoof?&amp;rdquo; I asked. That picture temporarily replaced the image of me being squashed to the size of a Barbie doll on the ocean floor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Yes, and the meat portion was fine. However, once the snail&amp;rsquo;s body had been digested, the shell was very difficult to-&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Ooookay, I think that&amp;rsquo;s probably enough about snails,&amp;rdquo; Jake said.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>(Calamari isn&amp;rsquo;t snail anyways, as Cassie yells shortly after this section).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting premise and some really weird and wonderful (ymmv) new morphs and a fun (pun intended) look into Pemalite technology and culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
