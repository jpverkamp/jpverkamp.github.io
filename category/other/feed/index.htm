<p>That being said, I think that unfortunately Precinct 13 was a somewhat weaker book. In particular, it had a pair of problems: a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink">fantasy kitchen sink</a> and <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne">chosen one</a> syndrome. Both have the possibility--as do all tropes--of being done well, but in this case I wasn't particularly thrilled with it.</p>
<p>So far as the kitchen sink, I feel like to do it right, you have to either introduce new beasties slowly (that's one thing I liked about both the Dresden Files and <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/02/20/the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a>) or just hint about the bigger world. Instead, we're hit pretty immediately over the head with witches and vampire-werewolves and fairies and golems.</p>
<p>Other than that, I don't really like 'chosen one' stories. I think this is less of a general issue and more one that bugs me in particularly. Specifically, I'm not a fan of stories where the main character is unique, with powers (especially unexplainable) unique that no one else has.</p>
<p>That being said, I thought two parts of the world building were neat: the aforementioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golem">golem</a> and parts of the magic system. Related to the golem, I don't often see Jewish influences in urban fantasy, so that was neat. I would like to see a little bit more of that. Also, the magic was neat--especially the magical tattoo early in the book and curses literally based on cursing.</p>
<p>Another idea that was interesting was the division between natural and unnatural magic. Basically, you can either use the natural ebb and flow of magic or you can force it to do your bidding. It's an interesting way to bring some prejudice into your story--which Hallaway does--although I think she could have done more with it.</p>
<p>All together, I thought it was a good enough story. I'm a little burned out on urban fantasy at the moment (I'm glad <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3220405-ender-in-exile?from_search=true">Ender in Exile</a> is up next) and I'm not sure I liked Precinct 13 enough to continue with the series when the inevitable sequel comes about, but you could do worse.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>White Trash Zombie</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/27/white-trash-zombie" /><id>urn:uuid:3985c60a-19e9-91ae-1029-68cb85330059</id><updated>2015-03-27T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9640626-my-life-as-a-white-trash-zombie"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/27/white-trash-zombie/1-i-was-a-white-trash-zombie.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12766833-even-white-trash-zombies-get-the-blues"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/27/white-trash-zombie/2-even-white-trash-zombies-get-the-blues.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15738579-white-trash-zombie-apocalypse"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/27/white-trash-zombie/3-white-trash-zombie-apocalypse.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19486406-how-the-white-trash-zombie-got-her-groove-back"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/27/white-trash-zombie/4-how-the-white-trash-zombie-got-her-groove-back.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Continuing on my recent trend, here is the third urban fantasy novel series in a row. After <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/02/20/the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a> and <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/13/alpha-and-omega">Alpha and Omega</a>, it's actually a breath of fresh air to see a series that doesn't take the everything-is-real approach and make a world where only one thing is different: zombies.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>On one hand, it's particularly interesting to see a zombie main character. Far more often than not, the zombies are the bad guys. Only rarely are they even particularly intelligent, let alone much more than evil monsters. Here, they're just like everyone else--just so long as they get a nice supply of brains. With brains, they not only remain human, but can actually push harder and faster.</p>
<p>The underlying means of how zombies work is pretty neat. Essentially, zombies have a brain based symbiote interested primarily in brains, but also in helping their host surive. It's for exactly that reason that zombies without brains begin to rot--the symbiote is forcing the host to choose their priorities. There's an interesting aspect that I wish the series got into more--once the symbiote has taken hold, how much influence does it have? How much has the person changed? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of Theseus">Are they still the same person?</a></p>
<p>One core theme throughout the book is how exactly do zombies get their brains (the main character ends up with a job at the local morgue). Killing people for their brains is rare enough--but not entirely ignored, bringing a bit of internal conflict. Another amusing note is how they eat them.</p>
<p>Another theme is the 'white trash' part of White Trash Zombie. If you read enough urban fantasy series, you tend to start seeing a lot of similarity between the main characters. It's not really that bad, since it's one of the reasons many people read them in the first place, but it's still nice to see something different. Particularly since there's a lot of room for growth. There's a lovely progression through the series as the main character gets her life together--sometimes by force, most drugs just don't work on zombies--all without completely abandoning her roots.</p>
<p>One oddity I found in reading all four books together is that the forth doesn't really fit with the first three. There's an increase in scale for each book, but it seems to me that the first fit together much better than the forth. It's interesting to see how the titular 'white trash' zombie deals with traveling a thousand miles further than she ever has in her life, but her sudden ascention to power seems a bit odd. So it goes, it's still an enjoyable story. Plus it brings an interesting wrinkle to how zombies work that I really want to see how they work out. Luckily a fifth book is in the pipeline.</p>
<p>All together, the White Trash Zombie series was a nice breath of fresh air. (Amusing that.) Still urban fantasy, but a much different approach. 28 books down, we're just over a quarter done bookwise with the year, and with a few days left in the quarter to boot. Awesome.</p>
<p>Up next, I have <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12779838-precinct-13">Precinct 13</a>, yet another kitchen sink urban fantasy. Should be fun, although at this point, I'm glad it's only a single book. Then we try some science fiction instead for a while.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Alpha and Omega</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/13/alpha-and-omega" /><id>urn:uuid:4fba16fd-f197-c4b3-dc04-facf8a172097</id><updated>2015-03-13T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2355575.Cry_Wolf"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/13/alpha-and-omega/1-cry-wolf.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5292853-hunting-ground"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/13/alpha-and-omega/2-hunting-ground.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7942786-fair-game"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/13/alpha-and-omega/3-fair-game.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18941694-dead-heat"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/13/alpha-and-omega/4-dead-heat.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Back to Alpha &amp; Omega. I'd previously read the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40932-mercy-thompson">Mercy Thompson</a> series, set in the same universe. It is a really interesting world in which a subset of the supernatural critters (only the fae at the start of the series) are 'out' in the public consciousness. Since the story is told from the perspective of various supernaturals and takes place primarily in their world, Briggs manages to avoid some of the problems that would come with such a revelation.</p>
<p>After reading both Alpha &amp; Omega and Mercy Thompson, I'm really hard pressed to say which series I like more. There's a certain familiarity and depth to Mercy, being the older (for me) and longer series, but Alpha &amp; Omega is the new shiny. It's nice to see a contrast between the mostly outsider perspective into the lives of werewolves that Mercy brings versus a wolf's look from Anna.</p>
<p>The fantastic elements to this story are well thought out, with a particularly interesting amount of attention paid to the relative dominance of werewolves and how that influences their ranks within the pack. Although it turns out that the original studies about alpha wolves aren't actually that great<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>, it's still an interesting aspect for the story.</p>
<p>In addition to the wolves, you get the normal rogues gallery common in most urban fantasy. It turns out every story about things that go bump in the night is true. Vampires? Fae? Witches? Present and accounted for. It was particularly interesting reading the last book in Alpha &amp; Omega after reading <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/02/20/the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40346-the-dresden-files">The Dresden Files</a>. There's a bit more influence from / reference to Navajo myths and it's interesting to see how each series does it differently.</p>
<p>One note, for better or for worse. Alpha &amp; Omega deals a lot more with themes of helplessness and rape (although Mercy had some as well). It was at times uncomfortable even for me; I can't really imagine how it would read to someone that had to live through such things.</p>
<p>Overall, Alpha &amp; Omega is an excellent series, easily my favorite out of the ones I've read thus far this year. I still couldn't say if I would recommend it over Mercy Thompson or vice versa. Honestly, if you have the time, read both. The timelines are intermixed (with some mostly small references between them), so you could even read alternating books.</p>
<p>So far this year, that puts me at 24 books out of 100 after two and a half months. I've fallen behind a bit (only 5 books ahead of schedule instead of 7), but still well on my way.</p>

<p>I really like urban fantasy series and this is a fairly prototypical example there of. It's always interesting to see how an author marries the real world with various mythologies.

<p>On to my fourth series this year for my <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/52837-the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4414255.Kevin_Hearne">Kevin Hearne</a>.</p>
<p>First, let's start with the good parts:</p>
<p>I really like urban fantasy series and this is a fairly prototypical example there of. It's always interesting to see how an author marries the real world with various mythologies. In particular, this series forcuses on Irish mythology, which is something that I haven't really had that much experience with.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Another thing I liked is how many/all of various religious figures are represented. It gets a little crazy at times, seeing how various aspects of all the different world religious figures are all all out and about but it's fun to see them interact. I was particularly amused when Mary (yup, that Mary) showed up. That's not something I've often seen.</p>
<p>Finally, the books are really funny. Some of the humor was more than a little crude. I particularly enjoyed a lot of the mental back and forth between Atticus and his hound. While I agree with a lot of other reviews I've read about the series in that the latter doesn't actually feel like a dog, but that's not really the point. The point is that he's funny. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>
<p>Okay, now the less than great parts:</p>
<p>Atticus is supposed to be 2,100 years old. He really doesn't feel it. He claims that he's gotten very good at fitting in with modern young adults, but there's never really a sense of age or weight to him. He comments on all manner of events that he's been involved in, but there's really nothing to it other than those slight mentions.</p>
<p>How in the world have none of the mortal gods died by the beginning of the series? In the very first book, it becomes all too obvious that gods can be killed. But we're supposed to believe that pretty much all of them have survived for millenia until Atticus happens to come around? All righty then.</p>
<p>There is a tendency towards a male fantasy centric / sexist view, especially in the earlier books. I'd be willing to be that the author got more than a few reviews and comments about this and it is toned down somewhat by the latter books. Still, the idea of random goddesses and other woman seemingly ranodmly falling for the main character and the sidekick dog's obsession with poodles are offputting.</p>
<p>All that being said, there's an obvious comparison (at least in my mind) between this series and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40346-the-dresden-files">The Dresden Files</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10746.Jim_Butcher">Jim Butcher</a>. They are both urban fantasy series with a male-fantasy-powerful male protagonist; they both rely heavily on a quick moving snarky sense of humor. Iron Druid starts out at a higher level, although the latter Dresden Books do catch up rather well. All together, if you're only going to read one of them read The Dresden Files. But if you run out of Dresden Files, you could do worse than The Iron Druid Chronicles.</p>
<p>So far this year, that puts me at 20 books out of 100 after 51 days; 7 books ahead of schedule. I guess that's another indicator for how much I wanted to keep reading the Iron Druid Chronicles.</p>

<p>This was always something that I had in mind when I set my 100 book goal. It's a lot of books to read and if I'm just not enjoying a series overly much, it's worth moving along.</p>
<p>That's not to say that I didn't enjoy <em>His Majesty's Dragon</em>. It was a very interestingly written story, in a style that where I can actually imagine people during the era of the Napoleonic Wars speaking (although if they actually spoke like that, I will admit to having no idea). That being said, that was actually one of the the things that took my out of the story. Both of the main characters (the man and the dragon) spoke so eloquently, it was hard to identity with them.</p>
<p>Another positive was how well Novik wove the dragons into the story. It never felt like they were just tacked on, and she seems to have thought through many of the changes that would come about had dragons been there throughout history. It's an interesting take on alternate history--not changing particularly much, but rather enhancing what already happened with the changes you want to make. At the very least, it saves you the time and trouble of trying to deal with a true divergence. History is complicated. Making up your entire own history as deep and complicated as the real one? Oof.</p>
<p>Back to the negative though, I wasn't particularly thrilled with the characterizations of the dragons. I understand and like the idea of dragons as or more intelligent than humans, but on the other hand it's a little strange for them to be <em>so</em> smart just out of the shell--although Novik did comment that was because they learn while therein.</p>
<p>Also, their size. It's a given in any story involving dragons that the mere idea that they could fly is a little strange. They're just too big and heavy. But not only can dragons in this universe fly, they can do so while carrying entire crews of men. It's a really neat idea--that you can basically have an entire navel crew in the air--and on a 'ship' as intelligent as a man to boot--but four dragons carrying an estimated 2000 men? That's almost 40 tons of men per dragon. I'm not buying it. So it goes. It's still pretty awesome.</p>
<p>And finally, I'm not really a fan of chosen one / only one in the world type stories (one of the issues I had with <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/18/the-heroes-of-olympus">The Heroes of Olympus</a> as well), which is another reason not to carry on with this series. Throughout the first book is bad enough--<em>ooh, a new and unique species, at least in Europe</em>--the ending implies that the sequels will be even worse. So it goes.</p>
<p>All said and done, I did enjoy the story. It isn't exactly my sort of thing (thus not reading the sequels), but I'm sure there are many out there who would find it far more enjoyable. It's a neat world and it wouldn't hurt to read at least a chapter or two to just to see the writing style. It's certainly different.</p>
<p>Current progress: 11 of 100 books in 25 days. That puts me roughly 5 books ahead of schedule. Up next? <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/52837-the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a></p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Wool</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/20/wool" /><id>urn:uuid:ad72369b-9c38-f545-b71b-543bcd785367</id><updated>2015-01-20T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12287209-wool"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/20/wool/1-wool.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13178410-proper-gauge"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/20/wool/2-proper-gauge.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13202200-casting-off"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/20/wool/3-casting-off.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13314945-the-unraveling"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/20/wool/4-the-unraveling.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13425846-the-stranded"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/20/wool/5-the-stranded.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Second series of the <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">New Year</a>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3064305.Hugh_Howey">Hugh Howey's</a> series: Wool.</p>
<p>The story of how <em>Wool</em> came to be is actually pretty interesting. Howey originally self-published the first story (only ~50 pages) through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com's</a> <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/">Kindle Direct Publishing</a>. Although he didn't originally expect it to do as well as it did, it just took off and over the next few years he wrote several increasingly longer (although still well within the novella range) sequels.</p>
<p>Very cool.</p>

<p>So what is there to like about <em>Wool</em>? Well, the world is really interesting. It has everything that I both love and hate in a short story: getting me really into the world building and the characters, while at the same time knowing when not to get into the deep backstory that a full length novel could do. And then in the sequels, you get the best of both worlds with a more fleshed out world with all the little twists and turns you should have seen coming<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>I also really liked the characters. They each have unique voices and react well enough to difficult circumstances, something I like to see done well in a story. One problem I had around the middle of the series was the relationship between Juliette and Lukas. It just felt unearned. It grows and makes more sense by the end, but it still felt weird. Also Lukas' sudden ascension in power didn't feel earned to me. I get that he wanted a POV character in that role, but it still felt weird.</p>
<p>On the down side (and here be spoilers), the world doesn't really make that much sense to me. Perhaps it's because I'm not seeing the big picture, perhaps there are other ways throughout the world, but I just really don't get why each and every silo has to either follow the rules or <em>will</em> collapse. Honestly, in a few hundred years, no one has managed to build what Juliette seems to be trying for at the end of the series?</p>
<p>All that being said, I really loved these books. I can see why they took off so well on Amazon. If you like post-apocalypic fiction (or heck, even if you just don't hate it), give them a try.</p>
<p>So after 20 days, I've read 10 books. Even though <em>Wool</em> et al are significantly shorter, I'm still going to count them. With behemoths such as Way of Kings to balance the scales I'm sure everything will work out in the end.</p>
<p>Originally my goal was 24 books. I might just finish that by the end of the month. New goal? The full 100. So far I'm 4-5 books ahead.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>The Heroes of Olympus</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/18/the-heroes-of-olympus" /><id>urn:uuid:2b90f74b-9a8e-41b4-70c5-62e2f2bdb2da</id><updated>2015-01-18T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7736182-the-lost-hero"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/18/the-heroes-of-olympus/1-the-lost-hero.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9520360-the-son-of-neptune"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/18/the-heroes-of-olympus/2-the-son-of-neptune.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12127750-the-mark-of-athena"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/18/the-heroes-of-olympus/3-the-mark-of-athena.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12127810-the-house-of-hades"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/18/the-heroes-of-olympus/4-the-house-of-hades.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18705209-the-blood-of-olympus"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/18/the-heroes-of-olympus/5-the-blood-of-olympus.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>First series completed in the <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">New Year</a><span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, The Heroes of Olympus. It's the second series based on the idea that all of the Greek (and now Roman<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span>) myths were true. The gods/demigods/et al live in the 'center of the Western world' (read: America). It's actually a really neat idea and a really neat world. It turns out, those old myths are <em>really weird</em>.</p>
<p>But herein lies the main problem I had with <em>The Heroes of Olympus</em>. We've already been there / done this. <em>Percy Jackson and Olympians</em> did it and did it better. If you only read one of the two, I would honestly suggest that one. On the other hand, if you loved the Percy Jackson books and want to read more? You could do far worse.</p>
<p>Other than that, I had a few gripes. How in the world did they (the sort of general they) keep such a secret for so long? Especially given how everyone they meet seems to know? Why does it fall time and again to a small handful of children to save the world? How do they always have only a handful of days?</p>
<p>On the strengths, I really do like how different the new characters are. Leo is a lot of fun. Piper's godly parent is an interesting addition, not at all one of the 'big three' but surprisingly powerful nevertheless. Frank makes the world feel just a little bit larger.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the older characters (Percy, Annabeth, et al) feel a little strange. We already know their story and they've already saved the world. Now they're doing it again? And <em>once again</em> the fate of the world rests on a smile pile of children? All righty then.</p>
<p>Anyways, long story short(ish): I'm glad I read them. It was a fun series, although I doubt I will reread them any time soon. If you like this sort of book (and specifically already read the <em>Percy Jackson</em> series), check them out.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>How to Train Your Dragon 2 (DVD)</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/11/25/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-dvd" /><id>urn:uuid:1e52fbad-217a-f9d2-e1b5-2cfc56a8ec44</id><updated>2014-11-25T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/11/25/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-dvd/how-to-train-your-dragon-2.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" class="pull-left"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/11/25/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-dvd/how-to-train-your-dragon-2.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Things I didn't care for about the movie:</p>
<p>The 'big twist' didn't make much sense. Why in the world didn't she come home?</p>
<p>The alphas. The dragons in this universe have always been some mix of dogs and cats. Having a dominating influence, sure. But they're so different. How in the world does that work? And they're referred to as queen bees essentially?</p>
<p>How does Toothless do his thing? If it was that easy for any dragon to stand in, why hasn't that already happened?</p>
<p>The vying for the one woman's vikings attention was just weird. That could have been done better.</p>
<p>Things I did like:</p>
<p>It was interesting to see that they didn't keep away from death. There wasn't any blood either time, but the deaths in the movie still hit fairly hard--and they didn't undo them. Too often in films like this, there's  some surprise solution.</p>
<p>So it goes. It was still a pretty movie. I liked the animation. I just thought it could have been so much more...</p>

<p>Now don't get me wrong. It's been rather a while since I've read the book. But there seemed to be rather a few minor changes. Most of them were fine; for example, I didn't mind that his first memory of pain wasn't a sunburn. But the ending was a bit rocky. After a certain point, I just kept expecting the film to be over. Eventually they got back on the rails, but it took a while.</p>
<p>One good part at least was that I think <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000313">Jeff Bridges</a> was actually pretty good as The Giver. Just gruff and no-nonsense enough. He didn't have the odd accent from <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/07/26/r-i-p-d">R.I.P.D.</a> and for once he didn't feel like another incarnation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big Lebowski">the dude</a>. Also, it was interesting to see Taylor Swift in a film role, especially given that I didn't even know it was her until the credits.</p>
<p>Overall, I've seen worse movies. If this wasn't <em>the</em> film adaptation The Giver (given it took 20 years to make this one, we won't likely see another), I was hoping for more. What exactly, I couldn't tell you, but something more.</p>

<p>We have a fairly straight forward urban fantasy action flick with <del>vampires</del> demons and <del>werewolves</del> gargoyles squaring off in a war that's been raging for years<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span> Then there's the odd man out, one of a kind and more powerful than either of the main groups so of course everyone is looking for him. Seems awfully formulaic all around.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong of course, it's still a solid action movie. The fights are beautiful to behold, even on the small screen. The fireworks when a gargoyle or demon is <del>killed</del> ascended/descended<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span> are a sight to behold, really lighting up the otherwise thematically dark world.</p>
<p>On top of that, I really like seeing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0631490/?ref_=tt_cl_t4">Bill Nighy</a> as <del>Viktor</del> Naberius and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340485/?ref_=tt_cl_t14">Kevin Grevioux</a> switches sides this time around as <del>Raze</del> Dekar. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001584/?ref_=tt_cl_t3">Miranda Otto</a> does a much better job (at least in my opinion) than her outing in the Lord of the Rings.</p>
<p>On the downside, the dialog is pretty bad. The world building is just weird at times (why gargoyles?). For a planet of 7 billion people, I could just about count the number of times a real flesh and blood human appears on one hand<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></span>. And if the demons can collect that many bodies... Why are they still in hiding?</p>
<p>I will give them one bit of credit at least. It's a personal nit of mine when people use the name Frankenstein to apply to the monster. While there's something to be said for a family name being passed on, Frankenstein is the creator. At least in I, Frankenstein, they have Naberius <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">hang a lamp on it</a>.</p>
<p>Still. It's an okay action movie and it is really pretty. I'm glad that they took a chance at least on something a little outside of the normal tropes. If you've got a spare weekend and want to just veg for an hour and a half, this isn't a bad film for it.</p>
