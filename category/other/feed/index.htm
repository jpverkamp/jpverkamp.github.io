<p>Can Marvel do no wrong?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>More than anything, Guardians of the Galaxy was the film that people were expecting to flop. An unknown--and quite frankly weird--ensemble cast of characters combined with the first solid taste of the cosmic end of Marvel's universe and its amazing that they pulled it off at all. Still, Marvel has made a name for itself. That name filled the theaters... and Guardians of the Galaxy lived up to the hype.</p>
<p>Like many of the other Marvel movies, Guardians of the Galaxy thrived on its humor. With both Rocket and Quill wisecracking, Drax's overly literal nature, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin_Diesel">Vin Diesel's</a> command of Groot's native tongue, they had me laughing again and again. Contrasted with a whole pile of more dramatic moments (WE are Groot!) and you have one heck of a solid film.</p>
<p>One thing that I thought they overdid--just a little--was just how much of the universe they threw at viewers. In the rest of the Marvel movies, they've done a relatively good job at introducing things slowly. Here, we went from 0 to 60 in minutes flat, with aliens left and right (finally, a movie where humans really are the minority though), a big bad/bigger bad/biggest bad that we're supposed to somehow care about, and more references and shout outs than you can shake a stick at. That's one thing The Avengers had going for it--they had a whole slew of prequels to iron out the details. In Guardians of the Galaxy they had to hit the ground running.</p>
<p>Overall, if I had to rank Guardians of the Galaxy against the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I would put it below Captain America (both), Iron Man (the first), and the Avengers. Not too bad otherwise though. This year though, that puts it number 3 of 8. Again and again, this has been an excellent year for movies.</p>

<p>If only the writers had used more than 10% of their brains to come up with a better basis for their film...</p>
]]></summary><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-toggle="lightbox" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/07/26/lucy/lucy.jpg" class="pull-left"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/07/26/lucy/lucy.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>If only the writers had used more than 10% of their brains to come up with a better basis for their film...</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Generally, when I'm watching a movie or reading a book, I allow it one freebie, one thing which I will just accept and that they don't have to justify. Anything built on that, so long as it's reasonably internally consistent is fine. In Lucy, that would have been the 10% malarkey. It's absolute crap. And I would have been fine with it, if it didn't underpin *<em>the entire film</em>*. Plus, it would have been so easy to avoid. Just say the drugs boost the rate of electrical / chemical reactions or something like that. Or that it added more neurons, growing more brain matter. Heck, it even would have fit better with the growth hormone idea.</p>
<p>It's doubly unfortunate, since other than that it was a pretty good movie. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson">Scarlett Johansson</a> was amazing. She had just the right blend of vulnerable and kick ass to really sell what was happening. The progression of powers was odd, but just seeing the expression on her face--that slight tilt of her head--when she knocked out a whole hallway full of men was well worth it. Likewise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Freeman">Morgan Freeman</a> was a solid choice. The disbelief when Lucy first calls him? Priceless.</p>
<p>On the flip side, I did find it a little problematic that every single one of the villains in the film was Chinese--and basically none of the 'good guys' (for what they were). I'm all for diversity in film making... but it would be nice in general to have a better mix throughout the film industry.</p>
<p>One thing that seemed really strange at first but sort of grew on me was the quick cuts spaced throughout the film. When you have Lucy cornered by thugs, cut to a scene of a cheetah cornering an antelope. When Lucy's powers are ever increasing, cut to a full screen black and white percentage of her progress. At first, it felt rather 'film-schooly', but it grew on me.</p>
<p>Overall, I just can't let go of the 10% thing. Johansson brings it up a touch--and it works well enough as a mindless action flick. Let's say... #5. Just below Maleficent. Perhaps we need a film with Angelina Jolie opposing Scarlett Johansson. Now that would be something to see.</p>

<p>Maleficient was magnificent.</p>
]]></summary><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-toggle="lightbox" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/06/14/maleficent/maleficent.jpg" class="pull-left"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/06/14/maleficent/maleficent.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Maleficient was magnificent.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Well. Not really. But it's fun to say. :)</p>
<p>More acurately, Maleficient was surprisingly good. I seem to be saying that a lot this year, but it's still true. Based on the trailers, I was mostly going because I thought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a> would make an awesome villain (she did) and I thought the raising of the wall of thorns scene looked cool (it did).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, other than Jolie, I wasn't particularly thrilled with any of the other characters. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharlto_Copley">Sharlto Copley's</a> King Stefen did 'evil' well enough and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning">Elle Fanning</a> certainly had the right blend of innocent/clueless, but I just felt they could have done better. On the other hand, Jolie carries the movie almost by herself. She really fits the role that well.</p>
<p>One interesting thing that a lot of people have been talking about is the rape analogue when King Stefan drugs Meleficent and removes her wings. Honestly, I thought it was well done. Rape is a problem in our modern culture and if this gets people talking then that's a good thing. I'm not sure that murder was the proper response (even if there was far more than just this one reason), but that makes the conversation even better.</p>
<p>All together, solid. It's another in a line of movies that I wanted to rank higher, but it's just been a good year for movies. Based on some of the visuals alone--and the guts to make such a dark echo of a Disney film--I think... #4.</p>

<p>After the awesome first two films, the relative failures of The Last Stand and the Wolverine(s), and the return to form of First Class, I was cautiously hopeful for Days of Future Past. It had potential--near full casts of both sets of X-Men?--but potential doesn't necessarily mean good.</p>

<p>After the awesome first two films, the relative failures of The Last Stand and the Wolverine(s), and the return to form of First Class, I was cautiously hopeful for Days of Future Past. It had potential--near full casts of both sets of X-Men?--but potential doesn't necessarily mean good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>After seeing it though, I was again pleasantly surprised. They deal with the parallel story lines well, giving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Patrick Stewart">Sir Patrick Stewart</a> et al enough screen time that they didn't feel useless while at the same time, the new guard gets their chance to shine. The time travel is pleasantly internally consistent<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>, with the lack of ability to travel more than once at once<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span> lending some real tension to the future timeline.</p>
<p>On the negative side (and it's really not much, even at that), this film manages to make even more of a mess of the X-Men movie universe continuity, trying at once to unify the previous six films while at the same time blatantly ignoring other facets. Even worse, in all that time, it still feels like they're telling the same story 14 years in the making. Again and again, mutants are a thinly veiled analogue for <em>insert discriminated against group here</em>. People hate them (ostensibly in the same universe where they cheer for The Avengers and Spider-Man) and fear them and try to kill them. Unfortunately though, the story works. It's sadly just as relevant now as it was 14 years ago.</p>
<p>Still. A solid movie. Well worth seeing. I've always had a soft spot for the X-Men over Spider-Man (and I did enjoy it more, albeit not as much as I expected to), but it's not a Captain America. #3 it is!</p>

<p>I think that--for once--I was the perfect audience for this movie. Just geeky enough that I enjoy a good Spider-Man movie, but not so geeky that whatever changes they made from the comics are going to jump out / particularly bother me.</p>
]]></summary><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-toggle="lightbox" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/05/10/the-amazing-spider-man-2/the-amazing-spider-man-2.jpg" class="pull-left"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/05/10/the-amazing-spider-man-2/the-amazing-spider-man-2.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I think that--for once--I was the perfect audience for this movie. Just geeky enough that I enjoy a good Spider-Man movie, but not so geeky that whatever changes they made from the comics are going to jump out / particularly bother me.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Just like the <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/07/23/the-amazing-spider-man">first one</a>, I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Garfield">Andrew Garfield's</a> Spider-Man far more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobey_Maguire">Tobey Maguire's</a>. He just nails the sarcastic teen suddenly thrust into power.</p>
<p>One definite plus that this film had over its predecessor is the villain. Lizard is just strange and his 'evil plan' never made particularly much sense. Electro on the other hand? At first, seeing the trailers, I was skeptical. A dubstep powered villain? In Saints Row perhaps, but in Spider-Man? But actually, it works. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Foxx">Jamie Foxx</a> really sells the role and the fight scenes are just flat out pretty. They could have done a bit better with the whole 'Gwen Stacy just happens to know how the power grid works' bit, but so it goes.</p>
<p>Speaking of Gwen Stacy... <em>*spoilers*</em>. Well, I knew enough about the comics to know what was coming (and it's interesting that they didn't change it). But even knowing what was coming, it was still a powerful moment. It will be interesting to see what they do with it in the sequels...</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I'm actually rooting for them now. I just hope they can hold it together and not go the route the previous trilogy went with too many villains... What's that? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sinister Six">The Sinister Six</a><span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>? All righty then.</p>
<p>So... I liked it. More than Divergent, but nowhere near as much as either the Lego Movie or Captain America. That's the problem with watching only movies that you're expecting to like--you like all of them. I think that's a problem I can live.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>It's really quite amazing watching the creative minds behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe work. Again and again, I keep expecting them to overreach themselves. I keep waiting for this huge empire they've built to come tumbling down<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span>. Well... not this time. Not by a long shot.</p>
<p>All in all, this was a solid addition. It contrasts nicely with the first Captain American film, showing what happens when you take blind patriotism and trust in a massive central authority and turn it to the darker side. It's interesting to see how the Cap, Fury, and Black Widow each deal with it in their own ways.</p>
<p>And then there's the eponymous Winter Soldier. I really felt like they could have done a lot more with him. I know that there's a lot of potential there from the comics, even going so far as maybe having him eventually take up Cap's shield some day<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>One last bit that's particularly cool is the idea of what this will to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agents_of S.H.I.E.L.D.">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>. I haven't watched the newest episode where presumably they deal with all this fall out, but I bet it's going to get all sorts of interesting in a hurry. I don't know if there's ever been such a relationship between a series of films and another on TV, but it's really interesting to see how it all plays out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is only the third movie I've seen this year. An honestly, as good as it was, I would be ever so slightly to go see The Lego Movie again (that song is <em>just so *catchy*</em>). Still, a solid #2, and it might as well be a toss up with #1.</p>

<p>Well, it's better than <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com//2013/12/01/the-hunger-games-catching-fire/">The Hunger Games</a><span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span></p>
<!--more-->
<p>Basically, Divergent feels like someone saw the success of the Hunger Games and decided that they could do it better (which should sound familiar if you remember <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/02/17/beautiful-creatures">Beautiful Creatures</a>). At least so far as I can tell, that's not actually the case here, but it still feels that way.</p>
<p>In the case of Divergent, the world is slightly more believable, even if there are still a number of problems. Basically, teens are sorted into one of <del>four</del> five<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span> casts (vaguely reminiscent of the houses in Harry Potter) based on a sort of personality test, although it's possible to choose for yourself, if rare. Of course, the lead (and her brother) are two such that choose, abandoning their public servant (Abnegation) parents for the cops (Dauntless<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></span>) and brains (Erudite).</p>
<p>It doesn't seem like such a system would hold together for particularly long and--spoilers--it doesn't. Still, my general rule is a movie (or book etc) is allowed one <em>thing</em>. One suspension of disbelief. For Divergent, I'll give it the initial social structure.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I thought that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shailene_Woodley">Shailene Woodley</a> was well cast (even if she always seemed a little too clean, as either public servant or adrenaline junkie). I didn't like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_James">Theo James</a> quite as much, but so it goes.</p>
<p>Overall, a solid enough 2 of 2 for the year. If I had to guess, I'd say that Divergent will probably end up somewhere in the middle. It's a good enough distraction, but certainly not a great movie. I was pleasantly surprised and I'll go see the sequels if/when they come out.</p>

<p>As a side note: The story of the author (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Roth">Veronica Roth</a>) is actually pretty interesting.

<p>♫ Everything is awesome! ♫</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Sorry. It's probably stuck in your head again now. It's certainly stuck in mine.</p>
<p>Right. Where were we?</p>
<p>The Lego Movie. A movie, about Lego. Yet another case that I didn't believe could possible be a fraction as good as it turned out. It sounds either completely insane or completely awesome when you think about it... and it ended up a little bit of both.</p>
<p>I really like the world that they built. It's just mad enough to have come from a kid's mind and it manages to tie together a wide variety of worlds and styles (<strong>I'm Batman</strong>) seamlessly. I especially like the idea of the 'master builders'... and how they eventually learn that everyone has a builder within them, sometimes it's just buried a little deeper.</p>
<p>Another thing that was awesome were the characters. Emmet is the perfect everyman, Wyldstyle/Lucy is a refreshingly solid strong female character (at least through most of the film), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Freeman">Morgan Freeman</a> is Morgan Freeman. I can just imagine how much fun he had with that role. I was also pleasantly surprised with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Ferrell">Will Ferrell</a> as Lord Business et al. I don't always care for the roles he plays, but I think he really fit here.</p>
<p>As a side note, I thought it was great, some of the guest stars they got. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Daniels">Anthony Daniels</a> voicing C-3PO? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Dee Williams">Billy Dee Williams</a> as Lando Calrissian? Great fun.</p>
<p>Really, there's nothing really negative I had to say about this movie. I had a blast watching it and I'm sure I'll see it again. I wouldn't be surprised if this one ended up right near the top even after there's only a single movie to judge.</p>

<p>(Side note: I'm still working full time, so I won't have nearly as much flexibility as I used to about when I can catch new movies. I'll write up the ones that I see, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's a fraction of the previous two years.)</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/12/31/the-hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug" /><id>urn:uuid:941fe8a7-0000-6989-5487-97ae69071855</id><updated>2013-12-31T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-toggle="lightbox" href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/12/31/the-hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug/the-hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug.jpg" class="pull-left"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/12/31/the-hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug/the-hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug.jpg" /></a></p>

Fitting, since a year and change ago, <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/12/18/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey">the Hobbit</a> was my last film of 2012<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span></p>
<!--more-->
<p>Unfortunately, The Desolation of Smaug doesn't even reach the bar An Unexpected Journey set a year before. The latter<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span> at least had a lot going for it. A return to the spectacular world that Tolkein imagined and Peter Jackson brought to life. A new story, promising the zany hijinks of The Hobbit with just a bit of flavor foreshadowing The Lord of the Rings thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that's where the The Desolation of Smaug falls flat. Actually, the same as last year, the movie posters reveal the weak point. Last year, it was the entirely replaceable dwarves. This year we have Gandalf taking center stage, with a trio of elves, Thorin, Bilbo, and Bard the Bowman. But wait, you might say, Legolas? He's in The Hobbit? And is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangeline_Lilly">Evangeline Lilly</a>? Is she lost?</p>
<p>That's pretty much exactly what you get for taking a 300 page children's book and trying to turn it into an epic <del>three</del> <del>four</del> three<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></span> part film--even more than the three 600 page nice thick novels we've already seen. You have to add things, just to make the movie feel whole. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite work. The movie feels thin for a good part of it's not insubstantial length, and by then end you're just left wanting more. Well, you're in luck...</p>
<p>Ah, who am I kidding. I'll go see the next two too. Likely the week of their release even. Heck. It's the Hobbit.</p>
<p>Wait, what was that? I forgot the eponymous Smaug? No, that part was actually pretty awesome. It took far too long to get there, but I really loved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Cumberbatch">Benedict Cumberbatch's</a> voice. The fight scenes were a little much<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></span> and for such an ancient foo, he was surprisingly gullible. Hubris, I guess? So it goes.</p>
<p>Overall, not as good as the first. Not even as good as many of the films out this year. Still, enjoyable enough for what's in theaters.</p>

<p>Seriously, check it out:</p>
<p><a data-toggle="lightbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1x76DoACB8"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/12/28/frozen/trailer.png" /></a> <span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>It looks like a dumb comedy, starring the snowman and the reindeer. It could have been cute (Ice Age'esque, for example), but certainly not what we got.</p>
<p>Instead, we get a fairly solid return to the form of the Disney 'princess movie', a call back to the style we haven't seen in a decade or more. The songs were great (Well, mostly. It's not quite a Lion King or Mulan.), the humor was funny, and the plot was ... well, it's a kid's movie.</p>
<p>I think the best part though, is finally admitting that it doesn't take a prince to save the day. Heck, sometimes it doesn't even take the instant sort of 'true love' you see so often in fairy tales. I won't go any more into it, but I really like how they dealt with that particular aspect. Plot holes galore in why it was necessary in the first place<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span>, but still. It's a nice change of pace.</p>
<p>Honestly. I loved it. If that puts two kids movies in the top five, so be it. I'll definitely be watching it again the next time I go on a Disney kick.</p>
