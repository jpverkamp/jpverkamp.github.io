<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/49121-rama">Rama</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7779.Arthur_C_Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/65129.Gentry_Lee">Gentry Lee</a>.</p>
<p>I'm going to try something a little different this time. On previous series, I found it hard to write a blog post after reading several books back to back, I've been reviewing each book individual <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8261480-jp">on Goodreads</a> as I've read it. I have a short summary for the entire series, followed by the individual books. We'll see how it goes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Overall, I like the first book (the only by only <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7779.Arthur_C_Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, the rest were all co-authors<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/65129.Gentry_Lee">Gentry Lee</a>). It's the kind of science fiction driven not particularly by plot or character, but rather by discovery and exploration. It's not always done well, but in this case I particularly enjoyed it. Conversely though, the other three in the series have much more focus on character conflict and to a lesser extent (but more than Rama) a central plot.</p>
<p>That change in style really turned me off the second book in the series, to the extent that I almost didn't finish the series. I'm glad I did though. Each of the sequels (in particularly the first part of #2 and most of #4) has some interesting ideas and solid extensions of Clarke's original world.</p>
<p>If you're into more interested in the science part of science fiction, you could do far worse than Rama. If, on the other hand, you want a story with more depth to the characters and plots, give Rama II a chance (although just keep in mind that Rama and Rama II are fairly different). If you are a completionist, the last book is actually pretty good and does a reasonably good job of tying up a lot of loose ends from the previous books.</p>
<p>Now, the individual reviews. Warning, there will be (usually minor) spoilers!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112537.Rendezvous_with_Rama"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/06/21/rama/1-rendezvous-with-rama.jpg" /></a></p>
<h3>Rama</h3>
<p>It's been a little while since I've read much science fiction, particularly any of the sort that Clarke is known for. Forget strong plot or characters and focus entirely around the big idea: In this case, the starship Rama is plenty large.</p>
<p>It starts off quickly, only a few chapters before you're on the ship. From there, you have situation after situation, describing how interesting the world that Clarke has built is and how the explorers react to it. The lack of a more specific antagonist becomes more of a problem towards then end, in that the book just sort of ends. There are various problems throughout the book, but no sense of building. I'm still not entirely sure how much I like this style.</p>
<p>Overall though, I think it's a cool world and I want to know more. Given that the sequels were written many years later and co-written by an author with a somewhat different style (based on the forward in Rama II), it will be interesting to see how different they are.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112520.Rama_II"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/06/21/rama/2-rama-ii.jpg" /></a></p>
<h3>Rama II</h3>
<p>This book feels rather different from Rendezvous with Rama.</p>
<p>For the first half, I wasn't sure that I actually liked the difference. Rather than the almost sterile science fiction that Clarke is better known for, the sequel deals a lot more with characters, drama, and to some extent matters of faith. It's especially interesting in how long it takes them to even get to Rama, especially compared to the first book.</p>
<p>Through the next quarter though, it really started picking up. I started to actually care about the characters and couldn't put it down. The feel of the ship, especially with some of the new findings, is just different enough that I wanted to know more.</p>
<p>At first, I wasn't sure that I was going to read the other two sequels. After this, I'm not sure how I couldn't.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112518.The_Garden_of_Rama"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/06/21/rama/3-the-garden-of-rama.jpg" /></a></p>
<h3>The Garden of Rama</h3>
<p>Like Rama #2, I went back and forth while reading this one on if I was actually enjoying it or if I would finish it at all. In the end, I did finish it and I think I'll even start the last one mostly out of a sense of completionism.</p>
<p>Essentially, there are five sections:</p>
<p>In the first, the three explorers from Rama II are leaving the solar system at high speeds. The parts where they are exploring the ship and learning how to live with the local 3D printer and interacting with other alien species is neat. The part where they decide that two men and a woman are enough to start a colony... That's just a little weird. I missed the first book, where the science and sense of exploration was the core of the story.</p>
<p>In the second, they get to a sort of routing section and finally meet an alien intelligence (even if it's still a robot). They (and by extension, we) get some neat answers. I liked this section for precisely the same reason I didn't like the first section: it's about exploring the world of Rama.</p>
<p>In the third, they go back to Earth, both in the context of the story and for a few scenes. They are all new characters and I cannot figure out why I care about any of them. Then they're sent off to a colony on Mars, except... surprise, they're actually going to make a new colony on the rebuilt Rama II. This is fine, but I feel like it could have been shortened.</p>
<p>In the fourth, the colony grows and thrives. Or not. Turns out people are people and people are terrible. Really, this whole section was depressing and not really what I was hoping to see in this book. I liked the smaller scales of the first 2.5 books. This not so much. Especially since it all ends up with exactly the sort of power struggle and corruption that I both see as entirely too plausible and hope isn't actually inevitable in such situations.</p>
<p>Finally, there's a big jump in the last ten percent or so where Robert goes to meet with the avian colony from the previous books. Suffice it to say, they have a strange lifecycle that we'd previously , which would have been much more interesting had Orson Scott Card not done it ~4 years earlier in Speaker for the Dead. It is exactly the sort of thing I wanted though, I just wish it had more relation to the rest of the story and had more than 10% of the pages. This is why I'm reading the 4th book, hoping there will be more of this.</p>

<h3>Rama Revealed</h3>
<p>In my opinion, this was by far the best of the sequels.</p>
<p>They start by doing exactly what I wanted out of the middle two books: getting away from the human settlement and into a situation where they are learning and experiencing something strange. In this case, they go to live among the octospiders, an intelligent civilization highly skilled in genetics and biological science who are completely deaf and only speak in color. It's a fascinating and nicely thought out situation and I did like it.</p>
<p>Even when, halfway through the book, the focus shifts back partially to the rest of the human colony in Rama, it still maintains a tight focus, with the bigger scale events going on behind the scenes. There was still a particular feel of exploring how different societies deal with issues (such as war: the octospiders view all war as terrible, not just certain kinds).</p>
<p>The final section, when the return to another Node felt a little strange. Either because it was rushed or because it felt sort of artificial. I didn't particularly mind though, since it still was working out echoes of events from all of the previous books and acted as a sufficient capstone to the series. I did think it was nice that Michael and Simone make another appearance, even if the latter replied her mother's odd fixation with a two person continuation of the species.</p>
<p>At the very end, the book veers somewhat towards a philosophical / religions tangent, which felt a little odd (the Ramas are essentially God) but still thought provoking.</p>
<p>Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this book. If you made it through the middle two books, you should probably read this one as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>Side note: I didn't finish Whitechapel Gods (which was actually next on my original <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a>) since, after 20%, I just really wasn't getting into it. There are some really interesting ideas (a steampunkification disease for example), but it was hard to get a grasp on exactly what was going on. So it goes.</p>
<p>Overall, that 47 of 100 books for the year, exactly on schedule.

<p>It's a bummer, because it's such a fascinating world. I like the idea (shared by <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/02/20/the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a>) that not only are the gods still walking among us, but also that a god can have more than one form, depending on how and when it was worshipped. I like the idea that the old gods are pissed at the new gods (Media / The Internet) for encroaching on their territory. I like how the old gods feel more 'human', only somehow <em>more</em> yet also somehow <em>less</em>.</p>
<p>But the story itself drags at points, with several sections (the dreams in particular) which I thought were interesting, but I wasn't entirely sure why they were there. I've heard it said that Gaiman cut half of American Gods even before it was released, but at ~650 pages, it's still a hefty tome. I think it could have lost a little more.</p>
<p>Conversely, I did think that most of the characters were pretty solid. I thought Shadow was a solid enough protagonist, going along with a world gone mad until he'd had enough... and then a step or two more. I felt for Mr. Wednesday, trying to take back pieces of a world gone wrong. I liked the little hints and pieces of how the gods' lives had changed on coming to the new world.</p>
<p>All in all, it's the sort of book that I'm glad that I've read... but I doubt I will ever reread. There are a few interesting ideas buried in there that I'm sure will surface years from now, long after I've forgotten where they came from.</p>
<p>Since it took me so long (Two weeks? Was it really that long?) to read American Gods, I'm now at only 42 of 100 for my <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a>, fallen from 7 ahead to 3. Still, onwards!

<p>Right on the heels of <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/04/28/year-zero">Year Zero</a>, I have another book that got itself on my list based on the potential in its world building: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12988074-the-unnaturalists">The Unnaturalists</a>. I mean, how can you <em>not</em> be intrigued by a world where London seems to have been yanked into another world, where Science<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span> has grown into a religion.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>Therein lies the problem with the world though. It never quite gelled for me. There is quite a lot of world there, just waiting to be tapped, but it seemed too busy. It seemed to be a steampunk London torn from our world some time in the past, sent into a world where magic still holds sway--which is particularly odd. How do you have Science grow to the point it has in this story in a world where there are literal living fairies and sphinxes hanging around?</p>
<p>Also, it was never entirely clear what the rules were in the world. I don't strictly speaking have to know what the worlds are for magic systems, but I do prefer that there are rules. I never get the impression that is the case here. We have the last Witch in the world; Architects which can do... something; Tinkers with the ability to commune with Elemantals (essentially animstic spirits); and all manner of magical beasties. Don't get me wrong, there were some particularly cool visuals, it just didn't quite get beyond that.</p>
<p>Beyond the world building, the writing style was odd. There were two story lines: a rich girl rebelling against Victorian gender roles and a Tinker boy from the outskirts with the only remaining Tinker magic among his people. The former was written in first person present tense<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span>, the latter in third person. I can see where the two characters tie together, but for the most part, there seem to almost be two stories going on in parallel.</p>
<p>Finally, the love story just felt strange. Pedant Lumin/Hal/Bayne/The Architect is referred to four different ways at different points in the book; it took me a while to figure out they were all the same person. As a result, I couldn't figure out who he was and what in the world Vespa saw in him. It felt like the author was trying to make him adequately interesting, but it felt forced.</p>
<p>Overall, it took me a while to get finish this book. It never quite got to the point where I just wanted to put it down, but at the same point, it didn't keep me turning pages. So it goes. I'm sure there are many people who would enjoy this style of book. I'm just not one of them. So it goes.</p>
<p>So far, I've finished 41 of 100 books for the year, keeping me at a solid 6 books ahead of schedule<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></span>.

<p>Specifically, Year Zero starts with an interesting premise: Since the 1970s, aliens have been listening to our music--and they love it. But alien society at large also has a problem: art created by a 'primitive' species is bound by the laws of that species. In this particular case, copyright law. The end result: humanity is now due all of the universe's wealth (for better and for worse). Neat concept, yes?</p>
<p>The problem is that it starts to fall apart almost immediately. The basic conceit is that art is at the core of universal culture. That part seems fine. But in all the millions of species, we are the best at music--by a large margin. A step forward and our music seems universally loved. How that's possible in such a large universe? It's hard to swallow.</p>
<p>On the other hand I did like is the idea that in such a huge universe, just about every sort of alien life is possible. Life that looks like parrots... vacuum cleaners... and life that looks <em>almost</em> exactly like us. That's not a problem though, with that many species, chances are pretty good that one or more would end up just like us.</p>
<p>An interesting note is that the author of the book--<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6423803.Rob_Reid?ref=ru_lihp_nsup_as.6423803_0_mclk">Rob Reid</a> founded the company that developed Rhapsody. So a novel heavily invested with copyright law works well with the idea to 'write what you know'. It shows, with more details about copyright law and musical pop culture references than I personally cared for. I'm not convinced that this is a novel that is going to age well--although I guess that isn't the end of the world.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the characters are a little rough, closer to caricatures at times<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>. The plot is a little uneven, taking a while to get moving, then each conclusion in turn--including the finale--comes too suddenly.  When I first started Year Zero, I wasn't sure that I was even going to finish it. Around 20% in, something clicked and suddenly it was a few hours later and I'd finished it. If you liked the Hitchhiker's Guide, you'll probably like this book.</p>
<p>Counting my side trip into the <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/04/25/the-ender-quintet">Enderverse</a>, that puts me at 39 books just shy of the first 4 months. 100 books sounded mad at first, but I'm really enjoying it.

<!--more-->
<p>My first thought in re-reading these books? Wow, those got weird. I'd forgotten how philosophical they get. There are hints of the same in most of Card's works, especially as you get to some of his more recent writings. The first of the three--Speaker for the Dead--is relatively straight forward through most of it. The pequeninos are a neat concept for an alien race (give Card credit for that, each of the species in the Enderverse actually manages to feel alien) and the story is relatively straight forward. It actually makes some sort of sense that--after having skipped through three thousand years of history--Ender would be drawn right to the next aliens. A chance for forgiveness for his sins of all those years ago.</p>
<p>Once you get past that into the other two books though--that's when things get weird. Don't get me wrong. I actually like the discussions about aiúa. It's in the interesting category of fiction which makes me think what if... what if that's how the world actually did work? Would that be so bad? It does drag on at times, but it's still an interesting concept.</p>
<p>Then there's the change in focus, bringing in the world of Path in Xenocide and then both Divine Wind and Pacifica in Children of the Mind. If it were any other books, I think hat I would have liked to see how he built up the cultures, so different from anything I personally have much experience with. But in the context of Speaker for the Dead--it just feels off. Like there are two completely separate stories going on that got smooshed together at some point.</p>
<p>All together though, I still do greatly enjoy all five books in the Ender Quintet, each for different reasons. Ender's Game is near the top of my personal science fiction list with Speaker for the Dead as a worthwhile successor. Xenocide and Children of the Dead are a little lower, but interesting to read if you want a bit of a different philosophy for a little while. I have less of a history with Ender in Exile, but it's a good follow up to the others, just a little less deep--which sometimes is a good thing.</p>
<p>Next up, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12953520-year-zero">Year Zero</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6423803.Rob_Reid">Rob Reid</a>. From what I've read about it, I remain cautiously optimistic. The premise sounds fascinating (aliens were pirating our music for decades and just now realize that--by our laws--they own more money than there is in the universe). Conversely though, it's been compared to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Perhaps it's blasphemy, but that just wasn't my cup of tea when I last read it. We'll see how it goes.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>The First Formic War</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/04/16/the-first-formic-war" /><id>urn:uuid:bb79dce0-417c-c928-d86d-d6abda1a88d1</id><updated>2015-04-16T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13151129-earth-unaware"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/04/16/the-first-formic-war/1-earth-unaware.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16059350-earth-afire"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/04/16/the-first-formic-war/2-earth-afire.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490707-earth-awakens"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/04/16/the-first-formic-war/3-earth-awakens.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Continuing on the Enderverse kick after <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/04/06/ender-in-exile">Ender in Exile</a>, I've just finished <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/72732-the-first-formic-war">The First Formic War</a> trilogy, a collaboration (of sorts) between <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/55830.Aaron_Johnston">Aaron Johnston</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/589.Orson_Scott_Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.

<!--more-->
<p>The first of the issues this raises I already mentioned in my review of <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/04/06/ender-in-exile">Ender in Exile</a>. When you write a series of books out of chronological order, it's extremely easy to contradict yourself. In this case, there was really one sticking point: gravity manipulation technology. In Ender's Game (let alone the sequels), it's made relatively clear that humanity only learned to manipulate gravity from the formics. But in the First Formic War, there are two different groups using gravity technology, one for mining (in a way that sounds an awful lot like the Little Doctor) and the other for propulsion.</p>
<p>Now, it's entirely possible to explain this away in universe as Ender just being too young or others not even knowing that this was the case--except Mazer Rackham was one of the pilots of the planes using the gravity manipulation technology. So...</p>
<p>Now that is off of my chest though, I actually greatly enjoyed the series. I like it when you have multiple completely different points of view or time in a shared universe, so that you can see how some difference play out. I also liked the aspect of the First Formic War taking place when humanity is just starting to expand out into the solar system, with a colonies on other rocks (the moon and asteroids at least) and even mining in the Kuiper Belt. It's a segment of science fiction that isn't that common, so it was nice to see it here.</p>
<p>Next, the characters. There was definiately some give and take here. I liked Victor and his family. I thought their family dynamic was interesting, even if it did edge into the 'children are far smarter than adults' trope that the Enderverse relies fairly heavily upon. One interesting contrast was a bit right at the beginning of the first book about relationships in a closely related, isolated population. It got just as preachy as Ender in Exile, but for whatever reason, I thought this time it was more deserved and done much better.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I wasn't overly thrilled with the character of Lem. I get that there are people that think that, that are so set in their world view and so sure that everyone is out to get them that they cannot see it any other way. I even get that those can make interesting characters in fiction. He just really grated on me. I wish there had been more growth and change for him.</p>
<p>Third and final, Mazer Rackham and the MOPs were interesting. There's certainly an undertone of military worship (but only 'smart' military worship) going on as many of the Enderverse books have, but I think I liked how it worked out here. What I didn't care for as much was how obvious (at least to me) many of their political maneuverings and military tactics were. Need to justify military action in China? Publicly thank a high powered general ahead of time so he cannot back down without looking a fool. Need some way to attack under the landers? Oh hey, we happen to have these drills...</p>
<p>All that said and done, it's not bad. I'm looking forward to if/when the detail the Second Formic War even more. For now though, I think I'm going to go ahead and take one final side trip (for now) and finish the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/43963">Ender Quintet</a> before getting back to my list with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12953520-year-zero">Year Zero</a>.

So of course I had to read it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you're familiar with the other novels in the Ender Quintet, Ender in Exile takes place between the end of the war in Ender's Game and the events some 3000 years later in Speaker for the Dead. It details the first world (and to some extent, the second) that Ender visits, overlapping with and somewhat replacing the final chapter of Ender's Game.</p>
<p>All together, it's a solid enough book. I enjoy--as I always have--the character of Ender, although he remains from time to time too perfect. I enjoy reading about some of the other characters in this world as well, especially the captain (he's a jerk, but a well characterized one) and the family from Italy. I still don't quite get Valentine, but she's not so odd</p>
<p>One thing that felt completely different about this book was how it edged on preachy at times. Long swathes of the book were dedicated to ideas from evolutionary psychology espousing monogamy, even in cases where there is a severe gender imbalance (as is the case with the initial soldiers turned colonists). It wasn't quite enough enough to kick me entirely out of the story, but it's something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Another oddity is a problem that always comes up with prequels. Strictly speaking, Ender in Exile isn't supposed to be a prequel, but since it was written after books 3-5 of the Ender Quintent (and I read it after as well), there is a certain amount of knowing what will happen throughout the book that takes away a certain something. Add to that the chunk in the center of the book originally published (and I originally read) as the short story Gold Bug<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span>, and it feels just a bit messy.</p>
<p>As an aside, I had not previously read the novella <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/552987.A_War_of_Gifts">A War of Gifts</a>, set during Ender's time at Battle School, so I took a chance to do so now. On the upside, it's a really interesting look both at how a dedicated pacifist would fare at Battle School (although if a six year old could remain so dedicated) and one of the few times in the time at Battle School that the children actually feel like children. It usually doesn't bother me, but it's nice to have at least this little nod. On the downside, I see no reason why Ender had to save the day yet again. It's a big school. Is there really no one anywhere nearly as good at reading people and understanding them as Ender is?</p>
<p>All together, I enjoyed both rereading Ender's Game and reading the new (for me) Ender in Exile. It's almost enough to get me to reread the rest of The Ender Quintet. We'll see. Instead though, I'm actually going to inject an aside to my <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a> and stay in the Enderverse a little while longer at least with the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/72732-the-first-formic-war">First Formic War</a> trilogy.

<p>That being said, I think that unfortunately Precinct 13 was a somewhat weaker book. In particular, it had a pair of problems: a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink">fantasy kitchen sink</a> and <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne">chosen one</a> syndrome. Both have the possibility--as do all tropes--of being done well, but in this case I wasn't particularly thrilled with it.</p>
<p>So far as the kitchen sink, I feel like to do it right, you have to either introduce new beasties slowly (that's one thing I liked about both the Dresden Files and <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/02/20/the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a>) or just hint about the bigger world. Instead, we're hit pretty immediately over the head with witches and vampire-werewolves and fairies and golems.</p>
<p>Other than that, I don't really like 'chosen one' stories. I think this is less of a general issue and more one that bugs me in particularly. Specifically, I'm not a fan of stories where the main character is unique, with powers (especially unexplainable) unique that no one else has.</p>
<p>That being said, I thought two parts of the world building were neat: the aforementioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golem">golem</a> and parts of the magic system. Related to the golem, I don't often see Jewish influences in urban fantasy, so that was neat. I would like to see a little bit more of that. Also, the magic was neat--especially the magical tattoo early in the book and curses literally based on cursing.</p>
<p>Another idea that was interesting was the division between natural and unnatural magic. Basically, you can either use the natural ebb and flow of magic or you can force it to do your bidding. It's an interesting way to bring some prejudice into your story--which Hallaway does--although I think she could have done more with it.</p>
<p>All together, I thought it was a good enough story. I'm a little burned out on urban fantasy at the moment (I'm glad <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3220405-ender-in-exile?from_search=true">Ender in Exile</a> is up next) and I'm not sure I liked Precinct 13 enough to continue with the series when the inevitable sequel comes about, but you could do worse.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>White Trash Zombie</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/27/white-trash-zombie" /><id>urn:uuid:3985c60a-19e9-91ae-1029-68cb85330059</id><updated>2015-03-27T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9640626-my-life-as-a-white-trash-zombie"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/27/white-trash-zombie/1-i-was-a-white-trash-zombie.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12766833-even-white-trash-zombies-get-the-blues"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/27/white-trash-zombie/2-even-white-trash-zombies-get-the-blues.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15738579-white-trash-zombie-apocalypse"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/27/white-trash-zombie/3-white-trash-zombie-apocalypse.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19486406-how-the-white-trash-zombie-got-her-groove-back"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/27/white-trash-zombie/4-how-the-white-trash-zombie-got-her-groove-back.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Continuing on my recent trend, here is the third urban fantasy novel series in a row. After <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/02/20/the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a> and <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/13/alpha-and-omega">Alpha and Omega</a>, it's actually a breath of fresh air to see a series that doesn't take the everything-is-real approach and make a world where only one thing is different: zombies.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>On one hand, it's particularly interesting to see a zombie main character. Far more often than not, the zombies are the bad guys. Only rarely are they even particularly intelligent, let alone much more than evil monsters. Here, they're just like everyone else--just so long as they get a nice supply of brains. With brains, they not only remain human, but can actually push harder and faster.</p>
<p>The underlying means of how zombies work is pretty neat. Essentially, zombies have a brain based symbiote interested primarily in brains, but also in helping their host surive. It's for exactly that reason that zombies without brains begin to rot--the symbiote is forcing the host to choose their priorities. There's an interesting aspect that I wish the series got into more--once the symbiote has taken hold, how much influence does it have? How much has the person changed? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of Theseus">Are they still the same person?</a></p>
<p>One core theme throughout the book is how exactly do zombies get their brains (the main character ends up with a job at the local morgue). Killing people for their brains is rare enough--but not entirely ignored, bringing a bit of internal conflict. Another amusing note is how they eat them.</p>
<p>Another theme is the 'white trash' part of White Trash Zombie. If you read enough urban fantasy series, you tend to start seeing a lot of similarity between the main characters. It's not really that bad, since it's one of the reasons many people read them in the first place, but it's still nice to see something different. Particularly since there's a lot of room for growth. There's a lovely progression through the series as the main character gets her life together--sometimes by force, most drugs just don't work on zombies--all without completely abandoning her roots.</p>
<p>One oddity I found in reading all four books together is that the forth doesn't really fit with the first three. There's an increase in scale for each book, but it seems to me that the first fit together much better than the forth. It's interesting to see how the titular 'white trash' zombie deals with traveling a thousand miles further than she ever has in her life, but her sudden ascention to power seems a bit odd. So it goes, it's still an enjoyable story. Plus it brings an interesting wrinkle to how zombies work that I really want to see how they work out. Luckily a fifth book is in the pipeline.</p>
<p>All together, the White Trash Zombie series was a nice breath of fresh air. (Amusing that.) Still urban fantasy, but a much different approach. 28 books down, we're just over a quarter done bookwise with the year, and with a few days left in the quarter to boot. Awesome.</p>
<p>Up next, I have <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12779838-precinct-13">Precinct 13</a>, yet another kitchen sink urban fantasy. Should be fun, although at this point, I'm glad it's only a single book. Then we try some science fiction instead for a while.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Alpha and Omega</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/13/alpha-and-omega" /><id>urn:uuid:4fba16fd-f197-c4b3-dc04-facf8a172097</id><updated>2015-03-13T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2355575.Cry_Wolf"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/13/alpha-and-omega/1-cry-wolf.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5292853-hunting-ground"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/13/alpha-and-omega/2-hunting-ground.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7942786-fair-game"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/13/alpha-and-omega/3-fair-game.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18941694-dead-heat"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/13/alpha-and-omega/4-dead-heat.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Back to Alpha &amp; Omega. I'd previously read the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40932-mercy-thompson">Mercy Thompson</a> series, set in the same universe. It is a really interesting world in which a subset of the supernatural critters (only the fae at the start of the series) are 'out' in the public consciousness. Since the story is told from the perspective of various supernaturals and takes place primarily in their world, Briggs manages to avoid some of the problems that would come with such a revelation.</p>
<p>After reading both Alpha &amp; Omega and Mercy Thompson, I'm really hard pressed to say which series I like more. There's a certain familiarity and depth to Mercy, being the older (for me) and longer series, but Alpha &amp; Omega is the new shiny. It's nice to see a contrast between the mostly outsider perspective into the lives of werewolves that Mercy brings versus a wolf's look from Anna.</p>
<p>The fantastic elements to this story are well thought out, with a particularly interesting amount of attention paid to the relative dominance of werewolves and how that influences their ranks within the pack. Although it turns out that the original studies about alpha wolves aren't actually that great<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>, it's still an interesting aspect for the story.</p>
<p>In addition to the wolves, you get the normal rogues gallery common in most urban fantasy. It turns out every story about things that go bump in the night is true. Vampires? Fae? Witches? Present and accounted for. It was particularly interesting reading the last book in Alpha &amp; Omega after reading <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/02/20/the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40346-the-dresden-files">The Dresden Files</a>. There's a bit more influence from / reference to Navajo myths and it's interesting to see how each series does it differently.</p>
<p>One note, for better or for worse. Alpha &amp; Omega deals a lot more with themes of helplessness and rape (although Mercy had some as well). It was at times uncomfortable even for me; I can't really imagine how it would read to someone that had to live through such things.</p>
<p>Overall, Alpha &amp; Omega is an excellent series, easily my favorite out of the ones I've read thus far this year. I still couldn't say if I would recommend it over Mercy Thompson or vice versa. Honestly, if you have the time, read both. The timelines are intermixed (with some mostly small references between them), so you could even read alternating books.</p>
<p>So far this year, that puts me at 24 books out of 100 after two and a half months. I've fallen behind a bit (only 5 books ahead of schedule instead of 7), but still well on my way.</p>
