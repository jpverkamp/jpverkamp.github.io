<p>This was always something that I had in mind when I set my 100 book goal. It's a lot of books to read and if I'm just not enjoying a series overly much, it's worth moving along.</p>
<p>That's not to say that I didn't enjoy <em>His Majesty's Dragon</em>. It was a very interestingly written story, in a style that where I can actually imagine people during the era of the Napoleonic Wars speaking (although if they actually spoke like that, I will admit to having no idea). That being said, that was actually one of the the things that took my out of the story. Both of the main characters (the man and the dragon) spoke so eloquently, it was hard to identity with them.</p>
<p>Another positive was how well Novik wove the dragons into the story. It never felt like they were just tacked on, and she seems to have thought through many of the changes that would come about had dragons been there throughout history. It's an interesting take on alternate history--not changing particularly much, but rather enhancing what already happened with the changes you want to make. At the very least, it saves you the time and trouble of trying to deal with a true divergence. History is complicated. Making up your entire own history as deep and complicated as the real one? Oof.</p>
<p>Back to the negative though, I wasn't particularly thrilled with the characterizations of the dragons. I understand and like the idea of dragons as or more intelligent than humans, but on the other hand it's a little strange for them to be <em>so</em> smart just out of the shell--although Novik did comment that was because they learn while therein.</p>
<p>Also, their size. It's a given in any story involving dragons that the mere idea that they could fly is a little strange. They're just too big and heavy. But not only can dragons in this universe fly, they can do so while carrying entire crews of men. It's a really neat idea--that you can basically have an entire navel crew in the air--and on a 'ship' as intelligent as a man to boot--but four dragons carrying an estimated 2000 men? That's almost 40 tons of men per dragon. I'm not buying it. So it goes. It's still pretty awesome.</p>
<p>And finally, I'm not really a fan of chosen one / only one in the world type stories (one of the issues I had with <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/18/the-heroes-of-olympus">The Heroes of Olympus</a> as well), which is another reason not to carry on with this series. Throughout the first book is bad enough--<em>ooh, a new and unique species, at least in Europe</em>--the ending implies that the sequels will be even worse. So it goes.</p>
<p>All said and done, I did enjoy the story. It isn't exactly my sort of thing (thus not reading the sequels), but I'm sure there are many out there who would find it far more enjoyable. It's a neat world and it wouldn't hurt to read at least a chapter or two to just to see the writing style. It's certainly different.</p>
<p>Current progress: 11 of 100 books in 25 days. That puts me roughly 5 books ahead of schedule. Up next? <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/52837-the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a></p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Wool</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/20/wool" /><id>urn:uuid:ad72369b-9c38-f545-b71b-543bcd785367</id><updated>2015-01-20T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12287209-wool"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/20/wool/1-wool.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13178410-proper-gauge"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/20/wool/2-proper-gauge.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13202200-casting-off"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/20/wool/3-casting-off.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13314945-the-unraveling"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/20/wool/4-the-unraveling.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13425846-the-stranded"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/20/wool/5-the-stranded.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Second series of the New Year: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3064305.Hugh_Howey">Hugh Howey's</a> series: Wool.</p>
<p>The story of how <em>Wool</em> came to be is actually pretty interesting. Howey originally self-published the first story (only ~50 pages) through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com's</a> <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/">Kindle Direct Publishing</a>. Although he didn't originally expect it to do as well as it did, it just took off and over the next few years he wrote several increasingly longer (although still well within the novella range) sequels.</p>
<p>Very cool.</p>

<p>So what is there to like about <em>Wool</em>? Well, the world is really interesting. It has everything that I both love and hate in a short story: getting me really into the world building and the characters, while at the same time knowing when not to get into the deep backstory that a full length novel could do. And then in the sequels, you get the best of both worlds with a more fleshed out world with all the little twists and turns you should have seen coming<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>I also really liked the characters. They each have unique voices and react well enough to difficult circumstances, something I like to see done well in a story. One problem I had around the middle of the series was the relationship between Juliette and Lukas. It just felt unearned. It grows and makes more sense by the end, but it still felt weird. Also Lukas' sudden ascension in power didn't feel earned to me. I get that he wanted a POV character in that role, but it still felt weird.</p>
<p>On the down side (and here be spoilers), the world doesn't really make that much sense to me. Perhaps it's because I'm not seeing the big picture, perhaps there are other ways throughout the world, but I just really don't get why each and every silo has to either follow the rules or <em>will</em> collapse. Honestly, in a few hundred years, no one has managed to build what Juliette seems to be trying for at the end of the series?</p>
<p>All that being said, I really loved these books. I can see why they took off so well on Amazon. If you like post-apocalypic fiction (or heck, even if you just don't hate it), give them a try.</p>
<p>So after 20 days, I've read 10 books. Even though <em>Wool</em> et al are significantly shorter, I'm still going to count them. With behemoths such as Way of Kings to balance the scales I'm sure everything will work out in the end.</p>
<p>Originally my goal was 24 books. I might just finish that by the end of the month. New goal? The full 100. So far I'm 4-5 books ahead.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>The Heroes of Olympus</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/18/the-heroes-of-olympus" /><id>urn:uuid:2b90f74b-9a8e-41b4-70c5-62e2f2bdb2da</id><updated>2015-01-18T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7736182-the-lost-hero"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/18/the-heroes-of-olympus/1-the-lost-hero.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9520360-the-son-of-neptune"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/18/the-heroes-of-olympus/2-the-son-of-neptune.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12127750-the-mark-of-athena"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/18/the-heroes-of-olympus/3-the-mark-of-athena.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12127810-the-house-of-hades"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/18/the-heroes-of-olympus/4-the-house-of-hades.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18705209-the-blood-of-olympus"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/18/the-heroes-of-olympus/5-the-blood-of-olympus.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>First series completed in the New Year<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p>

<p>So, The Heroes of Olympus. It's the second series based on the idea that all of the Greek (and now Roman<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span>) myths were true. The gods/demigods/et al live in the 'center of the Western world' (read: America). It's actually a really neat idea and a really neat world. It turns out, those old myths are <em>really weird</em>.</p>
<p>But herein lies the main problem I had with <em>The Heroes of Olympus</em>. We've already been there / done this. <em>Percy Jackson and Olympians</em> did it and did it better. If you only read one of the two, I would honestly suggest that one. On the other hand, if you loved the Percy Jackson books and want to read more? You could do far worse.</p>
<p>Other than that, I had a few gripes. How in the world did they (the sort of general they) keep such a secret for so long? Especially given how everyone they meet seems to know? Why does it fall time and again to a small handful of children to save the world? How do they always have only a handful of days?</p>
<p>On the strengths, I really do like how different the new characters are. Leo is a lot of fun. Piper's godly parent is an interesting addition, not at all one of the 'big three' but surprisingly powerful nevertheless. Frank makes the world feel just a little bit larger.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the older characters (Percy, Annabeth, et al) feel a little strange. We already know their story and they've already saved the world. Now they're doing it again? And <em>once again</em> the fate of the world rests on a smile pile of children? All righty then.</p>
<p>Anyways, long story short(ish): I'm glad I read them. It was a fun series, although I doubt I will reread them any time soon. If you like this sort of book (and specifically already read the <em>Percy Jackson</em> series), check them out.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>How to Train Your Dragon 2 (DVD)</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/11/25/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-dvd" /><id>urn:uuid:1e52fbad-217a-f9d2-e1b5-2cfc56a8ec44</id><updated>2014-11-25T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/11/25/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-dvd/how-to-train-your-dragon-2.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" class="pull-left"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/11/25/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-dvd/how-to-train-your-dragon-2.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Things I didn't care for about the movie:</p>
<p>The 'big twist' didn't make much sense. Why in the world didn't she come home?</p>
<p>The alphas. The dragons in this universe have always been some mix of dogs and cats. Having a dominating influence, sure. But they're so different. How in the world does that work? And they're referred to as queen bees essentially?</p>
<p>How does Toothless do his thing? If it was that easy for any dragon to stand in, why hasn't that already happened?</p>
<p>The vying for the one woman's vikings attention was just weird. That could have been done better.</p>
<p>Things I did like:</p>
<p>It was interesting to see that they didn't keep away from death. There wasn't any blood either time, but the deaths in the movie still hit fairly hard--and they didn't undo them. Too often in films like this, there's  some surprise solution.</p>
<p>So it goes. It was still a pretty movie. I liked the animation. I just thought it could have been so much more...</p>

<p>Now don't get me wrong. It's been rather a while since I've read the book. But there seemed to be rather a few minor changes. Most of them were fine; for example, I didn't mind that his first memory of pain wasn't a sunburn. But the ending was a bit rocky. After a certain point, I just kept expecting the film to be over. Eventually they got back on the rails, but it took a while.</p>
<p>One good part at least was that I think <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000313">Jeff Bridges</a> was actually pretty good as The Giver. Just gruff and no-nonsense enough. He didn't have the odd accent from <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/07/26/r-i-p-d">R.I.P.D.</a> and for once he didn't feel like another incarnation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big Lebowski">the dude</a>. Also, it was interesting to see Taylor Swift in a film role, especially given that I didn't even know it was her until the credits.</p>
<p>Overall, I've seen worse movies. If this wasn't <em>the</em> film adaptation The Giver (given it took 20 years to make this one, we won't likely see another), I was hoping for more. What exactly, I couldn't tell you, but something more.</p>

<p>We have a fairly straight forward urban fantasy action flick with <del>vampires</del> demons and <del>werewolves</del> gargoyles squaring off in a war that's been raging for years<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span> Then there's the odd man out, one of a kind and more powerful than either of the main groups so of course everyone is looking for him. Seems awfully formulaic all around.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong of course, it's still a solid action movie. The fights are beautiful to behold, even on the small screen. The fireworks when a gargoyle or demon is <del>killed</del> ascended/descended<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span> are a sight to behold, really lighting up the otherwise thematically dark world.</p>
<p>On top of that, I really like seeing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0631490/?ref_=tt_cl_t4">Bill Nighy</a> as <del>Viktor</del> Naberius and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340485/?ref_=tt_cl_t14">Kevin Grevioux</a> switches sides this time around as <del>Raze</del> Dekar. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001584/?ref_=tt_cl_t3">Miranda Otto</a> does a much better job (at least in my opinion) than her outing in the Lord of the Rings.</p>
<p>On the downside, the dialog is pretty bad. The world building is just weird at times (why gargoyles?). For a planet of 7 billion people, I could just about count the number of times a real flesh and blood human appears on one hand<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></span>. And if the demons can collect that many bodies... Why are they still in hiding?</p>
<p>I will give them one bit of credit at least. It's a personal nit of mine when people use the name Frankenstein to apply to the monster. While there's something to be said for a family name being passed on, Frankenstein is the creator. At least in I, Frankenstein, they have Naberius <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">hang a lamp on it</a>.</p>
<p>Still. It's an okay action movie and it is really pretty. I'm glad that they took a chance at least on something a little outside of the normal tropes. If you've got a spare weekend and want to just veg for an hour and a half, this isn't a bad film for it.</p>

<p>Edge of Tomorrow.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Edge of Tomorrow (aka Live Die Repeat<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>) is a surprisingly solid movie. Looking back, I would say that it's probably Tom Cruise's best film in more than a decade--heck, I might even put it above Minority Report, in which case I'd actually call it his best film ever.</p>
<p>The aliens are downright alien--and pretty cool looking--the effects are well done, and the Groundhog Day applied to war<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span> concent works out really well. But what really carried the movie were <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/?ref_=tt_cl_t1">Tom Cruise</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1289434/?ref_=tt_cl_t2">Emily Blunt</a>. Lovely performances.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a solid sci-fi action flick with a touch of what-if inducing thought behind the scenes, you could do far worse than Edge of Tomorrow. I really wish that I'd gotten a chance to see it in theaters. It seems like exactly the sort of movie that would benefit from the big screen treatment.</p>

<p>Can Marvel do no wrong?</p>

<p>Can Marvel do no wrong?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>More than anything, Guardians of the Galaxy was the film that people were expecting to flop. An unknown--and quite frankly weird--ensemble cast of characters combined with the first solid taste of the cosmic end of Marvel's universe and its amazing that they pulled it off at all. Still, Marvel has made a name for itself. That name filled the theaters... and Guardians of the Galaxy lived up to the hype.</p>
<p>Like many of the other Marvel movies, Guardians of the Galaxy thrived on its humor. With both Rocket and Quill wisecracking, Drax's overly literal nature, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin_Diesel">Vin Diesel's</a> command of Groot's native tongue, they had me laughing again and again. Contrasted with a whole pile of more dramatic moments (WE are Groot!) and you have one heck of a solid film.</p>
<p>One thing that I thought they overdid--just a little--was just how much of the universe they threw at viewers. In the rest of the Marvel movies, they've done a relatively good job at introducing things slowly. Here, we went from 0 to 60 in minutes flat, with aliens left and right (finally, a movie where humans really are the minority though), a big bad/bigger bad/biggest bad that we're supposed to somehow care about, and more references and shout outs than you can shake a stick at. That's one thing The Avengers had going for it--they had a whole slew of prequels to iron out the details. In Guardians of the Galaxy they had to hit the ground running.</p>
<p>Overall, if I had to rank Guardians of the Galaxy against the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I would put it below Captain America (both), Iron Man (the first), and the Avengers. Not too bad otherwise though. This year though, that puts it number 3 of 8. Again and again, this has been an excellent year for movies.</p>

<p>If only the writers had used more than 10% of their brains to come up with a better basis for their film...</p>
]]></summary><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/07/26/lucy/lucy.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" class="pull-left"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/07/26/lucy/lucy.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>If only the writers had used more than 10% of their brains to come up with a better basis for their film...</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Generally, when I'm watching a movie or reading a book, I allow it one freebie, one thing which I will just accept and that they don't have to justify. Anything built on that, so long as it's reasonably internally consistent is fine. In Lucy, that would have been the 10% malarkey. It's absolute crap. And I would have been fine with it, if it didn't underpin *<em>the entire film</em>*. Plus, it would have been so easy to avoid. Just say the drugs boost the rate of electrical / chemical reactions or something like that. Or that it added more neurons, growing more brain matter. Heck, it even would have fit better with the growth hormone idea.</p>
<p>It's doubly unfortunate, since other than that it was a pretty good movie. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson">Scarlett Johansson</a> was amazing. She had just the right blend of vulnerable and kick ass to really sell what was happening. The progression of powers was odd, but just seeing the expression on her face--that slight tilt of her head--when she knocked out a whole hallway full of men was well worth it. Likewise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Freeman">Morgan Freeman</a> was a solid choice. The disbelief when Lucy first calls him? Priceless.</p>
<p>On the flip side, I did find it a little problematic that every single one of the villains in the film was Chinese--and basically none of the 'good guys' (for what they were). I'm all for diversity in film making... but it would be nice in general to have a better mix throughout the film industry.</p>
<p>One thing that seemed really strange at first but sort of grew on me was the quick cuts spaced throughout the film. When you have Lucy cornered by thugs, cut to a scene of a cheetah cornering an antelope. When Lucy's powers are ever increasing, cut to a full screen black and white percentage of her progress. At first, it felt rather 'film-schooly', but it grew on me.</p>
<p>Overall, I just can't let go of the 10% thing. Johansson brings it up a touch--and it works well enough as a mindless action flick. Let's say... #5. Just below Maleficent. Perhaps we need a film with Angelina Jolie opposing Scarlett Johansson. Now that would be something to see.</p>

<p>Maleficient was magnificent.</p>
]]></summary><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/06/14/maleficent/maleficent.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox" class="pull-left"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/06/14/maleficent/maleficent.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Maleficient was magnificent.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Well. Not really. But it's fun to say. :)</p>
<p>More acurately, Maleficient was surprisingly good. I seem to be saying that a lot this year, but it's still true. Based on the trailers, I was mostly going because I thought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a> would make an awesome villain (she did) and I thought the raising of the wall of thorns scene looked cool (it did).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, other than Jolie, I wasn't particularly thrilled with any of the other characters. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharlto_Copley">Sharlto Copley's</a> King Stefen did 'evil' well enough and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning">Elle Fanning</a> certainly had the right blend of innocent/clueless, but I just felt they could have done better. On the other hand, Jolie carries the movie almost by herself. She really fits the role that well.</p>
<p>One interesting thing that a lot of people have been talking about is the rape analogue when King Stefan drugs Meleficent and removes her wings. Honestly, I thought it was well done. Rape is a problem in our modern culture and if this gets people talking then that's a good thing. I'm not sure that murder was the proper response (even if there was far more than just this one reason), but that makes the conversation even better.</p>
<p>All together, solid. It's another in a line of movies that I wanted to rank higher, but it's just been a good year for movies. Based on some of the visuals alone--and the guts to make such a dark echo of a Disney film--I think... #4.</p>
