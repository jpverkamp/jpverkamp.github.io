<p>The basic idea is that the Creator of the Universe has left the building--literally. They left behind a Will, but the seven Trustees in charge of seeing it done choose not to. One of these bits of sentient Will chooses a random pre-teen (or is he 13? it's unclear) to be the Heir to the Kingdom/House, by way of making him fight each of the seven Trustees in turn.</p>
<p>It's a weird world, but fun to read. There are a few interesting thoughts in there and plenty of quick, kid friendly (mostly) action.</p>
<p>Individual reviews (spoilers):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47613.Mister_Monday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/1-mister-monday.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that Arthur died. He had a massive asthma attack, and, as his oxygen starved brain struggled its last, he hallucinated all of the rest. How else do you describe just how ... odd this book is.</p>
<p>That being said, I liked it. It's weird. Garth Nix really does his Proper Nouns. Everything felt like it Meant Something, although we never quite got a perfect idea what Anything was. Most of them were close enough though; so it goes. It's quick and the action picks you up and pulls you right through the story. When it's over, there's something of a feel of getting off a roller coaster, but in a good way.</p>
<p>Final thoughts: Is this series really going to take place over a week (Earth time)? All righty then.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47620.Grim_Tuesday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/2-grim-tuesday.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Of course they're all going to take place over a week (Earth time)...</p>
<p>There's really not much different between Mister Monday and Grim Tuesday. Arthur is starting to accept his fate while at the same time learning more about the rules of the House. It interesting to see him change even in just the first two books thus far.</p>
<p>It's nice to see a bit more of Suzy and also a bit more of the House. I see how they're going to have a different setting and antagonist each day, with an overarching world to tie them together. It's a neat idea and I want to see it all of the way through.</p>
<p>Also, apparently the Morrow Days are the 7 Deadly Sins? Was that ever explicitly mentioned?  Sloth and Greed down, 5 to go.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47619.Drowned_Wednesday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/3-drowned-wednesday.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The world of the Keys to the Kingdom continues to get more interesting and weirder all at once. This time around, we have a sort of Multiversal Ocean and the Morrow Day that governs it. It's an interesting world all itself, with ships that were once other things, uplifted rats, and a very Nix'ian version of the Jonah and Whale story.</p>
<p>It's neat to finally see one of the Morrow Days that actually wants to help. I'm guessing we won't see much of that with the other half.</p>
<p>Also, oh snap that cliff hanger at the end. These really are seven parts of a seven part serialized novel. Nothing wrong with that though. It's an interesting style. I wonder if Nix wrote all seven of them before publishing?</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47618.Sir_Thursday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/4-sir-thursday.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Not much to say. Onwards and upwards for Arthur, taking on another of the Trustees and gaining another of the Keys.</p>
<p>Pretty much all of the problems in this book seemed overly easy to subdue, the Skinless Boy and Sir Thursday included. I think this has been going on for all of the rest of the books, but it seemed even more obvious in this one. Perhaps it's a factor of how relatively short they are?</p>
<p>Although on the flip side, setting things up with <spoiler>the Piper</spoiler> was interesting. I expected him to show up at some point, but this was a little different.</p>
<p>Also Dame Primus is totally going to be a problem. Called it here.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17206.Lady_Friday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/5-lady-friday.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>It's interesting throughout the whole series, Nix has managed to combine a relatively formulaic story with new twists and weird new worlds in each and every book.</p>
<p>The House just keeps getting weirder. I'm not sure how it's even really a 'House' at all. I think originally it was going to be and the Tuesday and Wednesday happened...</p>
<p>We don't actually see much of Lady Friday; the least of any thus far. So it goes.</p>
<p>It's interesting to see Arthur finally accept that he's going to finish this and, to do that, he has to use the Keys. Given how narrow a margin he was on before, I was curious how long that would take.</p>
<p>The Will is going to be a problem...</p>
<p>Five down, two to go.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2049823.Superior_Saturday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/6-superior-saturday.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I like the visuals around Saturday's realm. It's one of the better ones when it comes to motivation and the idea of a gigantic clockwork tower stretching upwards... cool.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we saw even less of Saturday than we did of Friday, which is saying something. I think she and Arthur were in the same scene for maybe a half dozen paragraphs? It's a bit weird. I assume we'll see more of her in the next book, but it's something of a departure.</p>
<p>Back on Earth, things continue to escalate. Did Nix really <spoiler>drop a nuke on the city?</spoiler> Looks like. It's an interesting move. I'm betting time travel shenanigans will be involved in the finale.</p>
<p>Speaking of the finale, the Will still hasn't caused nearly as much trouble as I expected. It keeps building up and then... nothing. At least nothing big. Another for Sunday I guess.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6657648-lord-sunday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/7-lord-sunday.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Overall, everything I was hoping for in an ending to the series.</p>
<p>We get to see a lot of Sunday and Sunday's realm: the Incomparable Gardens. It makes as much sense as anything in the rest of the House, so just go with it.</p>
<p>There's a lot of action, more than any previous book.</p>
<p>It's nice to see a bit more development in Leaf and Suzy.</p>
<p>The ending was... weird. Given the rest of the series, perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's not the best thing I read in 2015 (although it currently does hold that title for 2016), but it's still pretty good. I'm glad I got a chance to fit it in.</p>

<p>20 series this year, compared to 24 from last year. I have a few re-reads in here (Mistborn and Mercy Thompson) along with a nice pile of new books. All told, I'm aiming for 52 books this year--one per week.</p>
<p>Here's my list of reviews (it will update as each one is added):</p>

<p>So... The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40853-necroscope">Necroscope</a> series by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20602.Brian_Lumley">Brian Lumley</a>.</p>
<p>I don't know if I've ever read anything in quite this genre before. It's basically urban fantasy, except set during the Cold War (which makes some sense, given this book was released in 1986) and with an extra helping of espionage (ESPionage) thrown in. It's an interesting change and the two styles complement one another.</p>
<p>The world building is neat, especially around the vampires. I like how this universe handles them. The prose itself is a bit strange at times (Lumley really likes exclamation points), but certainly readable. The contents veered well into horror at times, which isn't always my cup of tea--especially towards the end. Overall, I liked the first three a lot and the last two were worth finishing for completion's sake. I'll definitely be taking a break before (if) I start the next Necroscope series though.</p>

<p>So... The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40853-necroscope">Necroscope</a> series by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20602.Brian_Lumley">Brian Lumley</a>.</p>

<p>And now, the individual reviews. As is often the case, the individual reviews for later books will almost certainly spoil earlier ones (and at points, minor spoilers for the books themselves). Read at your own peril.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66655.Necroscope"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/29/necroscope/1-necroscope.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I don't know if I've read many books where the first two chapters go quite so strongly back and forth between this is cool and that's gross. It evened out a bit over the course of the book, but there was still a good amount of each.</p>
<p>The basic world building takes our own world and adds a bunch of ESPers on top; with ESPers being a general term for all sorts of supernatural power. We see people that can read minds, ones that can see far away events, and those that can speak with the dead (in two different flavors). It's an interesting sort of world and somehow manages not actually to feel too kitchen-sinky, which is a general problem in urban fantasy. Also, there are vampires. I have a feeling we'll be learning a bit more about them later, but so far I'm cautiously intrigued by this particular interpretation. They're weird and alien, which is neat.</p>
<p>One oddity with the book comes with the main character's abilities--that of a Necroscope. The basic idea is that he can speak with the dead and learn from / gain their abilities. It's a cool power, although in the last ten percent of the story it gets insanely powerful. I'm not sure how there can be a sequel, let alone a dozen of them. I'm curious to find out though.</p>
<p>Structurally, there's a framing story taking place in the present, telling the story that actually takes place throughout the past many years. In addition, we follow a few different viewpoints (following at least two main characters). It's a bit confusing at first, but started to gel for me about a quarter of the way through the story. There is at least one interesting twist that the frame allows, so I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the phrasing and especially the punctuation that interrupted my reading. I don't know if I've read a novel with quite so many ellipses and exclamation points. It's not a deal breaker, but it's weird.</p>
<p>Overall, worth the read and I'll check out the sequels. At the very least, I want to know how in the world their going to deal with such radical events for both main characters during the ending...</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60836.Necroscope_II"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/29/necroscope/2-vamphyri.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>So that's how the series will continue.</p>
<p>Basically, we get a bit more of Harry who is now sharing bodies with his infant son (it's about that weird) and communicating with the now dead main characters from the first book.</p>
<p>The world building continues to be one of the stronger parts of these books. This time around, we have a fair chunk of the book from the view point of two of the old vampires (Thibor and Faethor Ferenczy), including a look at how they were turned and what they did over their centuries of life. It's an interesting take of vampires, and I continue to want to want to know more about that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Harry's plotline and the moebius continuum remain weird. I think Lumley wrote himself into a bit of a whole introducing all of that at the end of the first book. Teleportation and time travel, essentially for free? Too powerful. Sanderson's Second Law: Limitations > Powers. It doesn't ruin the book by any means, but I think they could be stronger without.</p>
<p>The other present timeline follows Yulian Bodescu, another of Thibor's offspring (I thought vampires could only have one true offspring in this universe? I guess Yulian is something new). It's certainly an interesting story, if rather dark and probably could have carried the novel by itself. It didn't mesh particularly well with the flashbacks to the Ferenczys history though. They just didn't overly relate.</p>
<p>On the whole, an interesting read. Enough to keep me going on the series.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/636742.Necroscope_III"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/29/necroscope/3-the-source.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The Source follows a nuclear accident that manages to blow a hole in between our reality and the homeworld (more accurately home universe, since Harry cannot Moebius his way there) of the Vampires.</p>
<p>It's interesting watching this series progress from espionage mixed with urban fantasy and horror in the first book to a more historical urban fantasy (if that makes sense) to this one which veers a bit more into almost science fiction. We have a parallel universe, a tidally locked planet, and some really weird vampire biology. The world building around vampires continues to be the strongest part of this series (which is amusing, given that I find the Moebius Continuum and the various ESP powers to be among the weakest).</p>
<p>I'm still not particularly a fan of Harry Keogh, but for most of the book he has a relatively minor role and I like a lot of the new characters in this book. Overall, I liked to see the extra worldbuilding, but the story was a bit weaker. Given the conclusion, I can guess where the next book is going to go (Harry Sr vs Harry Jr). We'll give it a chance.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1063378.Necroscope_IV"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/29/necroscope/4-deadspeak.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Oh hey, turns out there is another Ferenczy. Or rather, that's what a lot of this book felt like. Don't get me wrong, it's interesting to fill out a few more of the possibilities of what might happen if a vampire spawns a mostly human child who then desperately tries to learn to be a Vampire. But at the same time, it's starting to feel like the same story again, just with different players.</p>
<p>Another twist this time, which I at first appreciated was that Harry has lost his powers (stolen from him by Harry Jr). So for a large chunk of the story, he cannot speak to the dead except in dreams--which he doesn't remember upon waking--and cannot access the Moebius Continuum at all. Given how often I've complained about how overpowerful the latter made him, I thought it would be good for him to lose the power, but of course I guessed he would at some point get it back. And just in time for the final battle too, making it feel like an echo of the final battle from Necroscope I. So it goes.</p>
<p>Also this one really played up the more sexual aspects of the story. They were already there in the previous books, but relatively minor and sort of out of the way. Not so much in Deadspeak. Several incidents certainly play into the horror aspect of things and for that I applaud them, but it's starting to get a bit ridiculous.</p>
<p>Overall, it's still an interesting enough entry to the series and worth reading for completion's sake. Likewise I'll read the fifth and final Necroscope for the same reason. Plus I am vaguely curious how Harry ended up with a bit of vampire in his soul after all...</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66658.Necroscope_V"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/29/necroscope/5-deadspawn.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I think I'm done with the Necroscope series, at least for the time being. And hey, technically this <em>is</em> the end of the first Necroscope series.</p>
<p>On the negative side:</p>
<p>This feels like 2 or 3 novels shoved together. There's the parts on Earth where Harry tracks down a serial killer. Then there are the Wamphyri in exile in the Icelands and what they find there. Then finally, there's Harry in the Vampire world and the final showdown. It all more or less comes together at the end, but switching back and forth was a bit rough.</p>
<p>The horror, especially around the serial killer plot line, just got too horrific for me. It certainly works as a shock factor I guess.</p>
<p>The relationship (as it was) between Penny and Harry was weird, abrupt, and ugly. Especially in how it ended. And I don't feel like it actually needed to be there for the story to progress as is it did.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Harry went dark. Given how too-good he was before, I thought a turn as anti-hero would be nice. It wasn't. It felt completely out of character for Harry. More in line for a vampire, but it's not what I was wanting to read in that character.</p>
<p>The sex scene with Lady Karen was ... weird. It certainly fits the horror scenes of the world, but I feel like I'm going to read a palette cleaner after this.</p>
<p>On the positive side:</p>
<p>I still really do like the world building around vampires in this world. They're actually horrific and alien, but with related aspects from their former human lives. All together, that seems something less common in modern vampire literature, so it's nice to see here. This was even better and weirder this time around, especially with some of the ancient ones come back.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think it's time for something lighter.</p>
<p>Well, that finishes my original <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a> (with the exception of Mere Christianity; that one is still in progress).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I'm still 2 books shy of my 100 book goal, so I think I'll start <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8347.Garth_Nix">Garth Nix's</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/42967-the-keys-to-the-kingdom">Keys to the Kingdom</a> series. From what I've been told, they're a bit lighter (everything is relative) and quick reads. I should be able to knock out two of them in the two days and change before the end of the year. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Zoo City</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/11/zoo-city" /><id>urn:uuid:328319d3-b13a-d305-4e78-a28bce9b8585</id><updated>2015-12-11T23:55:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7163862-zoo-city"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/11/zoo-city/zoo-city.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Basically, in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7163862-zoo-city">Zoo City</a> (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/426034.Lauren_Beukes">Lauren Beukes</a>), if you kill someone (is that the only way?) you end up with a literal animal manifestation of your guilt.

<!--more-->
<p>It's a really interesting concept; something that I haven't quite seen anywhere else (The Golden Compass is vaguely similar, at least in the animal companions). And the world is just gritty and dark enough that it felt like a dark echo of what our world could be / have been. Unfortunately, a lot of details are left unclear. What exactly is the Undertow? How do people get which animals? What did the main character actually do to get her Sloth? How different are the animals from their wild brethren?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as interesting as the world building is, the plot isn't that great. I'll admit, I actually stopped paying as close attention to what was going on about halfway through. Then some more things happened and the story was over and unfortunately I didn't feel any particular urge to go back and figure out how we'd gotten from point B to point Z.</p>
<p>On top of that, I didn't particularly care for the main character. When you open the first few chapters by writing scam emails and stealing people's money, you know there's a bit of an ethical conundrum going on. A character like that can work perfectly well as a main character in a book, but at least for me, you have to work twice as hard for it. Zoo City didn't quite make it.</p>
<p>So it goes. It was interesting enough to read.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>It's a relatively complex narrative structure, jumping from the Golem to the Jinni and even to a few minor characters within the space of a chapter. Even in one viewpoint, there are multiple timelines, showing how events a thousand years apart all fit together. Yet despite all of this, I never got lost, never couldn't figure out where I was in the story. It took a while for the story lines to start coming together (for a while, it felt like reading two books), but once they do things just keep pushing towards the conclusion.</p>
<p>Two things in particular I enjoyed about the story were the characters and the magic. The Golem and the Jinni have very different personalities, down to the very core of the sorts of beings they are. There is some commentary about the idea of an unchanging nature and choosing your own fate which I particularly enjoyed. I really felt for both of them by the end of the book and could see why they made the choices they made (even if they didn't make any logical sense).</p>
<p>The magic of the world was also neat. It's fascinating to see the magic of real world traditions. I honestly don't know how much of it was 'real' and how much embellished, but it all stayed just close enough to reality that I could see such things happening just like that in a close cousin of our own world.</p>
<p>Overall, this is one of the best books I've read this year. I'm glad my book club choose it, otherwise it might have been a while before I got around to it.</p>
<p>Side note: It looks like there may be <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27234491-the-iron-season">a sequel</a> in the works? Tentative release date in 2018 though... So it goes.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: When I first read Promise of Blood, I was reading it one chapter per day (discussing each over email as we went). Given the number of characters and initially disparate plot lines, this was probably not the best way to read this series. After reading the second two straight through in a single sitting or four, I actually went back and upped my rating for the first book. I almost want to go back and re-read it properly, but I doubt I'll do so.</p>
<p>Individual reviews (minor spoilers):</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790883-promise-of-blood"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/powder-mage-trilogy/1-promise-of-blood.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure what to think about this book.</p>
<p>On one hand, there are several varied magic systems in this book. You have the Privileged, the Marked, and the Knacked.</p>
<p>The Marked, also known as Powder Mages, are what I would have thought of as the core of the book, with the ability to basically control gun powder in various ways and to snort it as a drug, increasing their physical abilities. Side note though: It's weird that they're interchangeably called Marked and Powder Mages throughout the book. It took me more than a while to realize those two were the same thing.</p>
<p>The Privileged are more traditional fireball, lightning bolt sort of mages and, honestly, are more interesting. Which, for a series named after the Powder Mages, is a bit weird.</p>
<p>The Knacked are a fairly unique idea in that their magic is basically limited use super powers--the ability to go without sleep, for example, or a perfect memory. It's a neat idea, but I think it would be even better if it were the only magic system in the world. On top of the other two, it just seems ... busy.</p>
<p>So far as the actual story goes, you kick off the book with a bloody revolution: overthrowing and killing the king, along with much of the court, and all of the Privileged in the city. That's certainly a powerful start, and the rest of the book deals with the aftermath of such an event. I wish it had been a bit more focused though. The book jumps from scene to scene and viewpoint to viewpoint, sometimes skipping days or more in between. It's jarring and sometimes hard to follow.</p>
<p>Mostly related, I wish that there was a little more depth to the characters. You basically had Tamas the Angry, Taniel the Druggie, Adamat the Investigator, and Ka-poel the Voodoo Sidekick. I do like Adamat at least. Maybe the entire book should have been from his point of view? (Side note: Having Tamas and Taniel, both Powder Mages, be father and son was confusing. Their names are too similar. I kept getting them confused.)</p>
<p>And then the ending. So many things all come to a head all at once... and then it's over. A single shot and then we're in the Epilogue. It was surprising to say the least. I guess the sequels will deal with the fallout of those last few chapters, but honestly I'm not sure if this book caught me enough to convince me to read the sequels.</p>

<p>I think the main reason that I had some problems following all of the different storylines in the first Powder Mage book was that I was reading one chapter per day and discussion as I went. Reading straight through the second book helped keep everything together. It also helps that there are few to no new major characters.</p>
<p>Overall, this was very much the second book in a trilogy. It picks up where the first left off and sets up the third. It probably wouldn't stand particularly well alone, but then again it doesn't have to. It's pretty much action all of the way through, tying up various plot lines just to ramp things up even more.</p>
<p>The general world building continues to feel something like a kitchen sink, with at least four different fairly vague magic systems all interacting in odd ways. Ka-poel is even more a singleton that everyone (even the 'gods') underestimates. I'm still not sure exactly what she did to Taniel (if it was in fact her), but I am curious how that particularly bit will end.</p>
<p>I think Taniel had the strongest story of the book, growing and changing the most of any of the characters. He's still insufferable at times, but he's also interesting. Adamat got pushed to the edge and breaks things (and people) to get his family back. It's obvious, but it's still a solid storyline (and I'm glad it ended up as relatively well as it has for him).  Tamas' storyline behind enemy lines was interesting enough, but I want to see him back with the others again.</p>
<p>And ... cliffhangers. I cannot stop now, which is of course the point. But now I'm actually looking forward to what's next.</p>

<p>A solid conclusion. Basically, The Autumn Republic builds on the world of the first two books, without really needing to introduce much in the way of new characters (with a few relatively minor exceptions) or new world building, instead taking everything to a final conclusion.</p>
<p>So far as the characters go, I really found myself rooting for the good guys and hoping they would save the day, even when they did some not entirely unobjectionable things. In particular, I'm glad that Adamat's story at least didn't get any worse and that he managed to survive (spoilers) all the crap that the Marked and Privileged put him through.</p>
<p>So far as the world building goes, I still think that there were too many different magic systems floating around (especially when you take into account various power levels), but I think we finally got a bit more insight into some of the inner workings at least of the powder mages and Privileged which was nice. I'm vaguely annoyed that we didn't get any more about Ka-Poel or Nila, given that this is the last in the series. So it goes.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, worth the read. McClellan goes on my list of authors to watch.</p>
<p>Next up, I'm going to step away from my <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a> for a moment, since I have a book club meeting coming up and instead read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15819028-the-golem-and-the-jinni">The Golem and the Jinni</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6466778.Helene_Wecker">Helene Wecker</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7163862-zoo-city">Zoo City</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/426034.Lauren_Beukes">Lauren Beukes</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/910863.Spin"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/29/spin-saga/1-spin.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>(minor spoilers; although nothing more than used to be on the Goodreads summary)</p>
<p>I really enjoy science fiction where they take a really big / weird idea and just run with it. Spin is exactly that sort of book. In a nutshell, one night all of the stars seem to go out. Over the book, the protagonists discover that not the stars didn't actually go out, but rather the Earth was enveloped in a shell that is causing time on Earth to run roughly 100 million times slower, while at the same time preventing any ill effects therefrom.</p>
<p>It's a really cool idea and lets the author really jump through time in a way that not many novels can successfully pull off. On the level of the characters, we follow the main characters from the time the stars go out when they are children through the rest of their lives, jumping sometimes decades at a time (roughly in two different timeslines: one starting at age 10 and jumping forward, the other staying relatively constant towards the end of the timeline). On the scale of the rest of the universe, our sun grows old and warms the rest of the solar system, the stars all move about, and our galaxy even collides with another.</p>
<p>There is an interesting mix of high level science fiction on how the world changes as an impact of the Spin (the name of the shell enclosing the Earth for reasons that I never quite caught) with the low level lives of the characters. I didn't particularly like any of the characters, which is unfortunate, but having them ground the story was I still think a good choice.</p>
<p>Overall, solid big-idea science fiction. Well worth the read.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116410.Axis"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/29/spin-saga/2-axis.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of the other reviewers here are on point. In Spin, we followed the lives of a small groups of characters while <i>big ideas</i> happened around them, spanning either decades or billions of years, depending on your perspective. In Axis, the ideas are not nearly as big, the timespan isn't quite so vast, and the cast of characters has changed to ones I don't find myself caring about as much.</p>
<p>There is a bit of an interesting follow up here to the last chapter of Spin: what's on the other side of the arch and just what <i>are</i> the Hypotheticals. I think the first could make an interesting story all of itself, just following a series of explorers further and further through the worlds, but that's not what Axis is. And so far as the second--we don't really learn anything new. There are hints of something bigger (which is saying something, given something on a scale with the entire galaxy) and a few smaller neat ideas, but nothing quite comes together.</p>
<p>All together, I think one can either read just Spin or read the entire series (since from what I've read, Vortex is more of a sequel to Axis than either was directly to Spin). Looks like we'll give Vortex a chance.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9359796-vortex"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/29/spin-saga/3-vortex.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>After the strong opening in Spin and the someone meh followup with Axis, I wasn't expecting particularly much from Vortex. Consider me pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>Getting back to the huge events and big timespans of Spin, Vortex takes place ten thousand years after Axis, after the Temporal Arch discovered towards the end of that book ends its next cycle. Two of Axis' main characters (Turn and Isaac) are dumped out / recreated and picked up by a island sized ship that has been floating through arch after arch through the Eight Worlds (apparently the arches connecting Earth to Equatoria connect through several other worlds and finally end at Mars, which is a neat concept).</p>
<p>The far future society is interesting, as is the ruined Earth (global warming is bad). In the far future, societies seem to resolve around linked communities, either linking the thoughts of emotions of a community. The island they end up on is one of the latter, which has both its strengths but also a fair number of complexities, both of which I thought Vortex did an interesting job of exploring.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is actually a second story line interwoven into Vortex, revealing the ten thousand year future as a story written by a possible mental health patient. Honestly, I'm not sure why this storyline is here; I thought those parts weren't nearly as interesting (we've already seen that part of the timeline after the Spin) and could have been left out. They did set up an interesting possibility for the very conclusion, but that could have done without as well.</p>
<p>We also do learn more about the Hypotheticals (not so hypothetical any more...), which remains a neat concept, even if one that doesn't always make terribly much sense (how do they communicate?).</p>
<p>Overall, my previous point from Axis remains: If you read Axis, read all three. Vortex is a solid conclusion and an interesting book on its own merits. If you're more pressed for time, you can read only Spin and be well off.</p>
<hr />
<p>That puts me at 89 for the year, slightly behind where I should be. Trying to read a book every 3.65 days on top of <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/05/nanowrimo-2015">writing a novel</a> is... fun. Onwards though!</p>
<p>Next up, I'm going to finish the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/99602-powder-mage">Powder Mage Trilogy</a>. The first book wasn't the best I've ever read, but it was good enough to give the other two a chance. Plus, I'm hoping for a few more answers. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (The Millennium Trilogy)</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/10/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo" /><id>urn:uuid:1496c334-9eaf-6c9e-52cb-b9c854b65f9a</id><updated>2015-11-10T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2429135.The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/10/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/1-with-the-dragon-tattoo.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5060378-the-girl-who-played-with-fire"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/10/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/2-played-with-fire.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6892870-the-girl-who-kicked-the-hornet-s-nest"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/10/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/3-kicked-the-hornets-nest.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Individual reviews (warning: there are spoilers in the latter reviews for the earlier books):</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2429135.The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/10/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/1-with-the-dragon-tattoo.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>It's not that often any more that I finish a book in a day. That should tell you something about what I thought about the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Especially when it isn't fantasy. It isn't science fiction. It isn't horror (at least not the supernatural sort). Really, it's more of a investigation / thriller. Not a genre that I read that often.</p>
<p>Honestly, for the first half of the book, I wasn't sure that I was even going to finish it, let alone read the sequels. There were a few different story lines going on that I didn't really see how they fit together. Nothing overly much seemed to be happening. Then, around halfway through (when the main characters finally started to interact more), things really started moving. I read the rest of the book in one sitting.</p>
<p>It's certainly disturbing at times. It reminds me of Koontz style thrillers  (who's books I like, so that is a good thing) in shining a light into the darker corners of humanity--albeit without the supernatural angle Koontz usually has.</p>
<p>Then there's the rape scenes (Yes, that's probably a spoiler. But given the content, the fact that they're fairly well known, and that they don't end up having <i>that</i> large of an impact on the plot...).</p>
<p>They certainly bring another level of depth and pack a punch, but honestly I think the novel would be just as strong without them. There is plenty of other characterization for the characters involved and as mentioned, they don't seem to advance the plot. Honestly, I felt like they were included for the sake of including them, which is never particularly great writing, let alone for a rape scene.</p>
<p>That being said, it's an intense book. The second half drives to a powerful conclusion and there's a twist or two that I only saw coming in hindsight. I'm honestly surprised, but I'll definitely be moving on to the sequels.</p>
<p>Side note: There are points that you can tell this book was originally written in a different language. Some of the phrasing is odd along with parts of the setting (although that could have been done even in an English language novel). I don't think it detracted from the work, but it's something to keep in mind.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5060378-the-girl-who-played-with-fire"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/10/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/2-played-with-fire.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo took a while to get into. It wasn't until Lisbeth and Blomkvist were finally in the same place perhaps halfway through the book that things really started moving.</p>
<p>The Girl Who Played with Fire is much the same.</p>
<p>Honestly, if I were to rate the first half of the book, I would give it three stars, maybe even two. There are just a lot of details that I just don't particularly care about. It's only halfway through, when Lisbeth stands accused of murder and various investigations are spinning once again out of control that the book starts getting good.</p>
<p>The second half? Five stars. I read it in one sitting. Things just keep getting more and more screwed up, with corruption and terrible people all over this place. I'll say that for Larsson. He can write terrible people.</p>
<p>One weird thing throughout is that there is entirely too much detail about mundane things. On several occasions you get essentially a stream of thought for everything that a character is doing... when they're really not doing anything interesting. Shopping, for example.</p>
<p>All together though, it's a strong book. Lisbeth has been through hell and emerged with a powerful combination of strength and brokenness. There are terrible people in the world, but they can be beaten. It's definitely the second of a trilogy, given that ending, and now I have to finish that. Hopefully, it doesn't take so long to speed up...</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6892870-the-girl-who-kicked-the-hornet-s-nest"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/10/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/3-kicked-the-hornets-nest.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Given that Hornet's Nest kicks off immediately following the events of Played with Fire, I was hoping that it could keep up the momentum of the previous book and avoid the slow first half / crazy second half that the previous two books had suffered from. Unfortunately, no such luck. If anything, it takes even longer to get moving and the conclusion isn't quite as action packed as the previous novels.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I do feel like this was a solid conclusion to the series. It wrapped up a lot of loose ends that I hadn't even realized I was missing and finished character arcs, particularly for Lisbeth. She's still odd, but I'm really starting to understand where she comes from. And in the end, she wins. I would have been rather grumpy with the author (even if he is dead) had she not come out all right in the end.</p>
<p>One bit that I thought was odd was the subplot about Erika Berger changing jobs and being stalked. Just like the rape in the first book (which did turn out to have a much larger impact on the latter two books), I don't feel like it adds particularly much to the story. It does fit the theme about systematic corruption and victimization of women, but I feel like the story would have been just as strong without it.</p>
<p>As I've mentioned before, I don't read particularly much that's this close to the real world, but I did enjoy all three books in this series. Even though I would consider it the weakest of the three; if you've read the first two, you should read this one as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, it's hard to say that I actually 'liked' the books. They're certainly well written, although you can tell at times that they were written in Swedish and translated. But the subject matter is rough to read about, especially given that it's entirely possible for such things to be happening in the here and now. I do recommend at least the first though. It's something that people should read, if just for another perspective on life.</p>
<p>On another note, it's a little strange to know that you are reading a series published posthumously. I'm not sure if it actually would have changed how I read the stories or how I think about them had the author still been alive, but it is still something to think about.</p>

<p>Next, you cook them for a while (see above). The nice bit is that once you've cooked them, the skin comes right off. That is glorious, since it's so much easier to peel than with a knife.</p>
