<p>Individual reviews (warning: there are spoilers in the latter reviews for the earlier books):</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2429135.The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/10/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/1-with-the-dragon-tattoo.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>It's not that often any more that I finish a book in a day. That should tell you something about what I thought about the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Especially when it isn't fantasy. It isn't science fiction. It isn't horror (at least not the supernatural sort). Really, it's more of a investigation / thriller. Not a genre that I read that often.</p>
<p>Honestly, for the first half of the book, I wasn't sure that I was even going to finish it, let alone read the sequels. There were a few different story lines going on that I didn't really see how they fit together. Nothing overly much seemed to be happening. Then, around halfway through (when the main characters finally started to interact more), things really started moving. I read the rest of the book in one sitting.</p>
<p>It's certainly disturbing at times. It reminds me of Koontz style thrillers  (who's books I like, so that is a good thing) in shining a light into the darker corners of humanity--albeit without the supernatural angle Koontz usually has.</p>
<p>Then there's the rape scenes (Yes, that's probably a spoiler. But given the content, the fact that they're fairly well known, and that they don't end up having <i>that</i> large of an impact on the plot...).</p>
<p>They certainly bring another level of depth and pack a punch, but honestly I think the novel would be just as strong without them. There is plenty of other characterization for the characters involved and as mentioned, they don't seem to advance the plot. Honestly, I felt like they were included for the sake of including them, which is never particularly great writing, let alone for a rape scene.</p>
<p>That being said, it's an intense book. The second half drives to a powerful conclusion and there's a twist or two that I only saw coming in hindsight. I'm honestly surprised, but I'll definitely be moving on to the sequels.</p>
<p>Side note: There are points that you can tell this book was originally written in a different language. Some of the phrasing is odd along with parts of the setting (although that could have been done even in an English language novel). I don't think it detracted from the work, but it's something to keep in mind.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5060378-the-girl-who-played-with-fire"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/10/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/2-played-with-fire.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo took a while to get into. It wasn't until Lisbeth and Blomkvist were finally in the same place perhaps halfway through the book that things really started moving.</p>
<p>The Girl Who Played with Fire is much the same.</p>
<p>Honestly, if I were to rate the first half of the book, I would give it three stars, maybe even two. There are just a lot of details that I just don't particularly care about. It's only halfway through, when Lisbeth stands accused of murder and various investigations are spinning once again out of control that the book starts getting good.</p>
<p>The second half? Five stars. I read it in one sitting. Things just keep getting more and more screwed up, with corruption and terrible people all over this place. I'll say that for Larsson. He can write terrible people.</p>
<p>One weird thing throughout is that there is entirely too much detail about mundane things. On several occasions you get essentially a stream of thought for everything that a character is doing... when they're really not doing anything interesting. Shopping, for example.</p>
<p>All together though, it's a strong book. Lisbeth has been through hell and emerged with a powerful combination of strength and brokenness. There are terrible people in the world, but they can be beaten. It's definitely the second of a trilogy, given that ending, and now I have to finish that. Hopefully, it doesn't take so long to speed up...</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6892870-the-girl-who-kicked-the-hornet-s-nest"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/10/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/3-kicked-the-hornets-nest.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Given that Hornet's Nest kicks off immediately following the events of Played with Fire, I was hoping that it could keep up the momentum of the previous book and avoid the slow first half / crazy second half that the previous two books had suffered from. Unfortunately, no such luck. If anything, it takes even longer to get moving and the conclusion isn't quite as action packed as the previous novels.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I do feel like this was a solid conclusion to the series. It wrapped up a lot of loose ends that I hadn't even realized I was missing and finished character arcs, particularly for Lisbeth. She's still odd, but I'm really starting to understand where she comes from. And in the end, she wins. I would have been rather grumpy with the author (even if he is dead) had she not come out all right in the end.</p>
<p>One bit that I thought was odd was the subplot about Erika Berger changing jobs and being stalked. Just like the rape in the first book (which did turn out to have a much larger impact on the latter two books), I don't feel like it adds particularly much to the story. It does fit the theme about systematic corruption and victimization of women, but I feel like the story would have been just as strong without it.</p>
<p>As I've mentioned before, I don't read particularly much that's this close to the real world, but I did enjoy all three books in this series. Even though I would consider it the weakest of the three; if you've read the first two, you should read this one as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, it's hard to say that I actually 'liked' the books. They're certainly well written, although you can tell at times that they were written in Swedish and translated. But the subject matter is rough to read about, especially given that it's entirely possible for such things to be happening in the here and now. I do recommend at least the first though. It's something that people should read, if just for another perspective on life.</p>
<p>On another note, it's a little strange to know that you are reading a series published posthumously. I'm not sure if it actually would have changed how I read the stories or how I think about them had the author still been alive, but it is still something to think about.</p>
<p>Next up, back to science fiction: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/910863.Spin">Spin</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/27276.Robert_Charles_Wilson">Robert Charles Wilson</a>. The premise is that one night the stars went out and now time on the Earth is running roughly 100 million times slower than the rest of the universe. It's a really neat idea; I hope the execution is as good.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Mostly homemade pumpkin pie</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/02/mostly-homemade-pumpkin-pie" /><id>urn:uuid:a8effba5-c1cc-f361-f262-5673a40cf49c</id><updated>2015-11-02T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/02/mostly-homemade-pumpkin-pie/9-enjoy.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/02/mostly-homemade-pumpkin-pie/9-enjoy.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>And now pictures, because pictures are awesome!</p>
<p>First, you cut up the pumpkins and scoop out the guts:</p>

<p>My daughter is helping. She decorated hers:</p>

<p>Next, you cook them for a while (see above). The nice bit is that once you've cooked them, the skin comes right off. That is glorious, since it's so much easier to peel than with a knife.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/02/mostly-homemade-pumpkin-pie/3-peel.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/02/mostly-homemade-pumpkin-pie/3-peel.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>See, the skin just comes right off:</p>

<p>Next, mix everything except the spices into the pumpkin puree:</p>

<p>And now mix in the spices. The spices really make the pie:</p>

<p>Then... bake! It's odd that it's at two different temperatures, but so it goes:</p>

<p>Overall, I liked them. I thought they were weaker than either Percy Jackson or <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/18/the-heroes-of-olympus">The Heroes of Olympus</a> but still strong enough on their own merits.</p>
<p>Individual reviews:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7090447-the-red-pyramid"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/10/23/the-kane-chronicles/1-the-red-pyramid.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Red Pyramid would be a lot strong if I hadn't read Percy Jackson.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. Red Pyramid is still a fine book, although it feels like it's written for an even younger audience than Percy Jackson.</p>
<p>A few of the downsides:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Red Pyramid is told 'interview style', as if it were a transcribed copy of an audio recording. It would be fine as a framing device, except there are random interjections between the two narrators that each time pulled me out of the story. They're supposed to be 'witty', but I could have done without them.</li>

        <li>The humor feels younger than Percy Jackson. The five elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and ... Cheese. I guess I'm getting old.</li>

        <li>Despite having two narrators, it was hard to tell who's chapter I was reading at times. Riordan did this much better in the Heroes of Olympus.</li>

        <li>The BAD GUYS were BAD just for the sake of BEING BAD. Even from a kid's book, I would like a little more depth. Although I guess there's something to be said for gods playing a role.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a more positive note:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Egyptian mythology is weird! The flavor does play through several points of the story. Where the Greek and Roman gods felt 'human', the Egyptian gods feel weird. That's a good thing. The hieroglyphics in particular were a neat touch.</li>

        <li>There are hints at a shared universe (the western bank belongs to ... others) without it being overbearing. I don't think I would ever like to see a crossover with the Greek/Roman books, but the possibility is neat in and of itself.</li>

        <li>SUMMON BIGGER BAD. The ending was fairly obvious from early on (and once again strongly echoes Percy Jackson), but it did leave me wanting more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still. A fun read. Relatively quick. I'll finish the series.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9067850-the-throne-of-fire"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/10/23/the-kane-chronicles/2-the-throne-of-fire.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I don't really have particularly much to add for Throne of Fire that I didn't already say for The Red Pyramid.</p>
<p>Basically, more of the same. The Kanes have five days to save the world (it's impressive how even something like that can start to get old after a dozen novels...). They proceed to do so.</p>
<p>One particularly weird part this time: Sadie takes the time in the second day of the novel to go to Londor for her birthday. The fate of the world hangs in the balance... And you can teleport around the world. You can go to London later.</p>
<p>Another slight downside is that this very much feels like the middle book of a trilogy (which of course it is). It works more to set up the third and final book rather than being able to stand by itself. That doesn't necessarily make it bad, but it's not great when it's that obvious.</p>
<p>On the up side, the cast of characters has expanded a bit with a few new trainee godlings brought into the fold, apparently from that audio recording from the first novel.</p>
<p>Still, it was an entertaining enough read and kept me going enough that I still want to finish the trilogy.</p>

<p>A solid ending to the series. Once again the world will end in <i>n</i> days and it's up to Sadie and Carter to save that day.</p>
<p>Really, it feels like the second half of The Throne of Fire. We have the same support characters, the same big bad, the same magic, and it doesn't feel like that terribly much time has passed. Honestly, it's not a bad thing; it's just a little bit weird.</p>
<p>One thing I did like is that the climactic battle did actually feel big. It was a bit rushed, but it was nice to see everything coming together in a bunch of ways. The afterwards with the gods withdrawing was odd, but made sense. There there was a paragraph or two dedicated to setting the stage for a potential Percy Jackson crossover. I mentioned in a previous review: it's neat to think about, but I'm not sure how well it could be done.</p>
<p>So far as downsides, really the same as the previous two books. The meta story of being a transcription of an audio recording is weird. I sometimes couldn't tell which sibling I was reading. But it felt a little less bad this time around. Perhaps I just got used to it?</p>
<p>As I've said before: the series isn't quite as good as either the Greek or Roman series, but stand alone it's still certainly enjoyable. I'm glad I read them.</p>

<p>Arrayed against them; a beastie from the time of the dead gods raising a whole bunch of ghuls. Also a corrupt all powerful ruler and the Robin Hood esqe figure who may or may not be any better in the end.</p>
<p>One thing that I really loved about this book: the world. It's based on Arabic influences rather than the pseudo-European that I've seen in most of the fantasy I've read. Better yet, the Arabic influence is woven throughout the story in a way that just makes it come alive. You have sights and sounds and history and magic, all with (to me) a very new feel to it. If you've read a similar selection to me, this is worth reading just for that.</p>
<p>On top of that, I liked the relatively large ensemble cast. Even though we had five main characters and a whole pile of supporting cast (see above), I really thought that each had their own voice and I was greatly amused and intrigued with how each of them interacted with one another.</p>
<p>All together, it's a neat book. Especially after everything shakes out in the end, I wish the sequel were out already (planned release in 2016). What I think I really need is to do is to go find other fantasy novels from non-European authors...</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>

<p>I find it vaguely amusing how relatively many zombie series I've read this year. <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/27/white-trash-zombie">White Trash Zombie</a> (with the next October 6th!). <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/31/precinct-13">Precinct 13</a>. <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/18/elantris">Elantris</a> (Yeah--that doesn't really count.) Still, the more the merrier when you're hungry for flesh.</p>
<p>Overall, Newsflesh is an excellent series. Basically, in the future, zombies are here and bloggers have taken over the world. Where these stories really shine is their world building. The zombie plague is an infectious disease and society has changed as a result. It actually feels like something that could just happen, which really helped to draw me into the books.</p>
<p>Also positive, there are a goodly number of plot twists throughout the series. Some are obvious in hindsight, some even in foresight. And some... Ow. Some hit right where it hurts.</p>
<p>Here are my individual reviews. Warning: <strong>spoilers</strong>. Each book's review should be relatively spoiler-free, but it's hard to talk about Deadline and Blackout without spoilers for Feed.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7094569-feed"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/30/newsflesh-trilogy/1-feed.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Feed follows the story of George (yup), Shaun (also yup), and Buffy (not even kidding), three bloggers covering the story of a lifetime: a Republican Presidential candidate. Then, as it always goes in a zombie story, things go wrong.</p>
<p>I liked the characters. The bloggers are divided into a newsie (tells it like it is), an Irwin (basically the action stars of the blogging world) (yup), and a fictional (writes poetry); missing only a Stewart (satire in the news) (also yup). I really felt for all of them, even if at time they tended a bit towards caricatures of their roles. Also: evil bad guy is evil and obvious, but sometimes that's not a bad thing.</p>
<p>This is also one of the best treatments of a 'realistic' zombie outbreak that I think I've read. Society has mostly adapted to everyone being a carrier with a system of restrictions (no one can go to Yosemite) and near constant blood tests. The CDC is far more powerful and people have adapted to the idea that any mammal over 40 pounds could be your death.</p>
<p>Therein lies the first oddity with this book: Feed doesn't actually feel like a zombie novel. More than anything it feels like a novel about journalism, politics, and freedom of speech... which just so happens to happen during after the zombie apocalypse. It took me a while to realize this, but I think it makes the novel stronger as a result.</p>
<p>And then there's the twists, oh the twists. I get it, it's a zombie story. People are going to die. Just... I didn't see that coming... Wow. That's certainly one way to get me to read the sequel.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8429687-deadline"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/30/newsflesh-trilogy/2-deadline.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I was curious to see where Grant would take this, after killing off a small pile of main characters in the first book. It turns out: somewhere right between what I expected and what I didn't expect at all.</p>
<p>On one hand, Shaun is crazy now. He hears George's voice in his head and answers her out loud. Everyone around him of course thinks he's crazy, but they mostly seem to give him space. I'm not sure what I think about that. Shaun is still probably my least favorite of the main characters from the first book, which is certainly suboptimal, given that he's the only one to survive... (Also, the Coke fixation is weird.) But why does everyone else keep him around?</p>
<p>On the other hand, the world building continues to be excellent. We get a few neat twists (like what the reservoir conditions might actually mean) and dig a little deeper into the conspiracy behind it all. Given that there's still one more book, we don't get quite as much of that as I'd like, but so it goes. Still though, it feels like Grant really did her homework. The zombie threat feels real. That's saying something.</p>
<p>And then... The ending. One thing I don't care about in second books of trilogies is when they don't have an ending of their own. If Deadline had ended around 80%, it would have been fine. Instead, we get the ALL NEW BIGGER AND BETTER THREAT in the last 20% or so. Don't get me wrong, I really want to know how it all shakes out, but it's still annoying.</p>
<p>And then and then... That last sentence. Say <b>what!?</b></p>
<p>Needless to say, onwards to Blackout.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11806716-blackout"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/30/newsflesh-trilogy/3-blackout.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>A solid ending to a solid series. I think that I liked it more than Deadline, but less than Feed, owing entirely to one thing: George.</p>
<p>Yup, she's back. Literally the last thing that happens in Deadline gets fleshed out (heh) in Blackout as we alternate once again between Shaun's and Georgia's viewpoints. It's fairly obvious what's happened (and a neat extension of what we already know about the zombie virus), but that doesn't mean I was still rooting for her nevertheless.</p>
<p>That being said, her being back complicates Shaun's situation somewhat. He's not any less crazy and as odd as it sounds, his underlings are still just dealing with it. <spoiler>What's more, it's made explicit here that Georgia and Shaun have been sleeping together. I get it, and they're adopted rather than blood siblings, but it still feels a little off.</spoiler></p>
<p>Other than that, it's a solid conclusion to the series. We finally learn who the big bads are--although it's not a huge twist. We get a few more complications with the zombie virus with several nice showdowns across the country. The ending is less 'they all lived happily ever after' and more 'we may just survive this', but given the events of the stories, that's good enough for me. At least it's not a cliffhanger like Deadline...</p>
<p>Overall, great book, great series. Not quite on my list of favorites ever, but I'm glad I read it.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>Since there are only two and they're not particularly directly related to one another, here are the individual reviews:</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68427.Elantris"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/18/elantris/elantris.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I have yet to find a Sanderson novel that I don't particularly like and Elantris is no exception.</p>
<p>Basically, Elantris focuses around the titular city; once a place of wonder and magic which. Ten years ago, all that ended and now it's populated by essentially zombies: those without heartbeats who cannot die and cannot heal. We follow a few different story lines--a princess from another land engaged to the prince who gets Elantrisified in the very beginning of the story; an attempted religious coup from multiple fronts; and the politics of a kingdom/city trying to heal after massive upheaval.</p>
<p>This is his earliest work and in some ways it shows. He actually commented recently on the <a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/">Writing Excuses</a> podcast that he co-hosts that he's learned a lot about pacing since writing Elantris. Towards the end, I definitely noticed it. In the last 10% or so of the novel, everything comes to a head all at once. I think it could have been even strong had some of the storylines come to fruition earlier.</p>
<p>I did like a lot of the characters. Sarene reminds me strongly of Shallan from The Way of Kings (perhaps because it's the most recent other Sanderson novel I've read), but I think I actually like her more. Raoden seems almost too good to be true, but keeps just enough human trivialities (especially when interacting with Sarene), that I still like him. I particularly grew to like Hrathen. It's always interesting to see how fantasy novels interact with religion.</p>
<p>More than anything, I wish this novel had a sequel. Well, it sort of does in [book: The Emperor's Soul|13578175], although that it in a completely different part of the world. It looks like there is a true sequel in the works though (<a href="http://brandonsanderson.com/faq-will-there-be-a-sequel-to-elantris/">FAQ</a>). Awesome.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13578175-the-emperor-s-soul"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/18/elantris/the-emperors-soul.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>If I hadn't been told, at first I wouldn't realize that The Emperor's Soul takes place in a far away corner of the same world as Elantris. But as the story wears on, and the details of the magic system are revealed, it becomes more obvious that the worlds are one and the same. I really do love how Sanderson does magic systems. I've never seen anything quite like it, especially not at the same scale. Every system seems new, yet there's a shared core to all of them. I love it.</p>
<p>Other than that, I did like the character of Shai. There's something about an artist who works entirely to know that she did it, rather than for public acclaim that I enjoy. Sneaky and subtle. Excellent. I could see a few of the twists coming (that she wouldn't escape until the last moment; the changes she made), but that didn't make it any less enjoyable.</p>
<p>One thing I'd love to see if/when that Elantris sequel comes out? A meeting between the worlds. How would a Forger interact with an Elantrian? What about a Bloodsealer? I want to know more about them.</p>
<p>"You can't always write what you know--not exactly what you know. You can, however, write what you see." -- Brandon Sanderson</p>

<p>I've always had a problem with worlds like that in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13335037-divergent">Divergent</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games">The Hunger Games</a>. There's always something (the strict divisions between classes and the titular Games for two examples) that just doesn't make sense. In my opinion, Partials doesn't really have that.</p>
<p>You have a war (which ended years before the series takes place) that genetically engineered super soldiers were created to fight on behalf of humanity. After that, you have a bio-weapon / virus that wipes out 99.96% of humanity and, in this case, renders the remaining tens of thousands sterile. I would like to think it unlikely, but all of that--and the story that develops from there--seems believable for the not too distant future. All together, I enjoyed Partials even more than I expected. It's even better having listened to several seasons now of Writing Excuses--I know about Wells and the writing process he goes through than I do many authors. As mentioned in my individual review for the third book: If Divergent / The Hunger Games left you wanting more, this is it. If you haven't read either, read these instead.</p>
<p>Here are my individual reviews as I went:</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12476820-partials"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/16/partials-sequence/1-partials.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The story of Partials takes place 11 years after humanity lost a terrible war. Basically, we created super soldiers (Partials) to fight for us. Of course, after they won the war they turned on us... Worse yet, right at the same time, there was a virus which killed 99.96% of humanity--including any new pregnancies.</p>
<p>So that's where we start. Humanity is stuck on Long Island while the Partials are <i>out there</i>™. Because no babies can survive the virus, the youngest living people are 14. The main characters are roughly 16. Even stranger, in an effort to figure out how to cure the virus, the Hope Act has been enacted. All women 18 or older must get pregnant as often as possible.</p>
<p>It's an odd premise, but each part at least follows through. It's a little strange that the main characters are so good at what they do (always a problem with YA fiction), but at least the idea that they had to grow up quickly helps offset that.</p>
<p>Other than that, it's an interesting world. The action keeps things moving, especially towards the latter end of the book, and I actually feel for the characters as things keep going sideways on them. There were a few twists that followed the standard YA post-apocalyptic tropes (is that a thing now) but a few that I missed, which is nice.</p>
<p>Overall, it's perhaps not as strong as some of the other books I've read this year (although it's the best post-apocalyptic YA :)), but it's more than good enough to finish the series.</p>
<p>Onward!</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13645264-isolation"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/16/partials-sequence/0.5-isolation.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Quick and to the point, Isolation tells the story of Heron (who we met briefly in Partials) during the Isolation War. It gives a better picture into the Partials: how they are made, how they are trained, and why they might not only want to, but even been the right to, kill us.</p>
<p>It's a good story and I hope to see more of Heron in the second and third books of the Partials Sequence. It'll be interesting to see how she's grown and changed in the intervening years and how she interacts with the other human (and not) protagonists.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13170596-fragments"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/16/partials-sequence/2-fragments.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>A good continuation to Partials. In this book, we see Kira start to come to terms with who she is as she sets off with Samm and Heron across what's left of the United States in search of answers--only to find more than she was looking for. Meanwhile, Marcus is back home, stuck between two warring Partial factions, trying desperately to broker a piece.</p>
<p>It's a neat continuation. I like watching the world expand, exploring more of what happened in the decade and change since everything fell apart. We're starting to get some answers, which of course lead to more questions. I look forward to Ruins, cautiously hoping that Wells can pull everything together for the finale.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17607716-ruins"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/16/partials-sequence/3-ruins.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>A solid ending to a solid series.</p>
<p>I think Ruins actually managed to pull things together in a way without feeling (too) rushed that none of the other YA series recently have managed to pull off. The previous plotlines (Kira's conflicted nature, the rest of the Trust, the cure(s)) all come to a head in a way that's still driving enough to finish the series but don't feel like the author was just phoning it in.</p>
<p>There were a few things that I felt were just glanced over.</p>
<p>Kira manages to succeed where a decade of scientists (including those who caused the problem in the first place) have failed. That seems strange. But it's at least lamp shaded in that they were too blind to see a solution.</p>
<p>The two new Trust members come out of nowhere and never really make much sense. Plus, they're just sort of resolved. They're interesting, but I feel like they could have done more.</p>
<p>The love triangle just vanishes. Perhaps more real world accurate and I cannot believe I'm saying this: but it was weird.</p>
<p>All together though, a solid read and a solid series. If Divergent / The Hunger Games left you wanting more, this is it. If you haven't read either, read these instead.</p>

<p>So far, GoodReads says that I've read 71 books this year, with a total of 25,513 pages. Given that today is the 258th day of the year, that averages out to 100 pages per day and I'm right on target. Let's see if I can keep that up for the last third of the year... Especially with <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/nanowrimo">NaNoWriMo</a> looming just over the horizon.</p>

<p>Main problems:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There are <em>Proper Nouns</em> all over the place, but they're only rarely explained until much later (if at all). Some books can get away with this. This one did not.
    <li>The POV jumps from character to character and in some cases it can take a while to figure out who in the world is talking.</li>
    <li>Bannon (main character) is crazy powerful. Again, sometimes you can have a story start with a very powerful protagonist and go from there, but more often than not it doesn't work out.</li>
    <li>Clare (apparently supposed to be a main character) never really feels like a main character. He's badly overshadowed by Bannon and one of her Shields, to the point where I'm not sure why the series isn't titled Bannon and Mikal.</li>
    <li>Holy purple prose Batman. The wording feels accurate for the period (so far as I know, which I don't), but the fact that I noticed enough to comment on it isn't great. Also Bannon mentions over and over again how unladylike she's being. We get it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upsides:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Some of the descriptions were very cool. Counter to the last point above, I really could see what was going on in some of the scenes. Not necessarily why it was happening and I'm sure I got some of the <em>Proper Nouns</em> wrong, but it was still solid.</li>
    <li>There is a lot of neat worldbuilding just beneath the surface. I wish it was more obvious, but it's always interesting to read alternate history at this level. I want to know how things changed! I want to know how things work! Usually that wanting will drive me kicking and screaming through a story (in the best way possible). It almost did this time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to the point I made a little while back for Whitechapel Gods and <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/25/his-majestys-dragon">His Majesty's Dragon</a>. I'm sure there are loads of people who love this kind of story. I'm not one of them.</p>
<p>So it goes.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>The Academy</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy" /><id>urn:uuid:0b7731fd-746d-7733-9bc9-804c0233355e</id><updated>2015-08-27T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/337048.The_Engines_of_God"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/1-the-engines-of-god.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/352780.Deepsix"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/2-deepsix.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382161.Chindi"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/3-chindi.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/352781.Omega"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/4-omega.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/352775.Odyssey"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/5-odyssey.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/535318.Cauldron"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/6-cauldron.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>The Academy (it feels weird to call it that) takes place in a few century distant future where humanity has been to the stars and found them next to empty. There are hints at civilizations that have come before (a monument on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_(moon)">Iapetus</a> for example) and others still around, albeit not at our same technological level. There are terrible threats: truly giant clouds of gas that seem to have a thing for destroying cities in several of the novels and a planet about to fall into a gas giant in another.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Overall, it's pretty solid science fiction. It's a little weird reading them all in sequence, since they only roughly seem to relate to one another. Sometimes characters are shared (superluminal pilot Priscilla "Hutch" Hutchins is one; reporter/editor Gregory MacAllister is another) and it's definitely a shared universe, but there are some events which come up in one book and not again for several sequels (if at all). It's not <em>bad</em> per say, just odd.</p>
<p>I do really like the world (galaxy?) that McDevitt has built here. I want to believe that life is far more common than he paints it--as a wise man once said, 'life finds a way'--but if that's not the case, I can imagine things working out exactly like this.</p>
<p>One particularly interesting point is that faster than light travel in this universe is possible, but limited. It still takes weeks / months / longer to get to other stars--which can be something of a problem if you happen to need rescuing. It's a perfect example though of just how <em>big</em> space is.</p>
<p>Also interesting (although I don't think I mention it in the individual reviews below) is the use of AI throughout the series. Each superluminal has an AI (although the Academy's seem to all be copies of a single AI named Bill) with a personality all its own. Yet they're just part of the world; for the most part people just interact with them as people. It's a neat idea and I like how it fits so seamlessly into the world.</p>
<p>That being said, here are my individual reviews:</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/337048.The_Engines_of_God"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/1-the-engines-of-god.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The Engines of God fits into the same rough style of science fiction as Rama, where the story is drive more by events and discovery than particularly by plot or character. In my opinion, this can be a perfectly enjoyable form of story, just so long as you know that's what you're getting.</p>
<p>The basic idea of this story is that in the future, humanity has developed faster than light travel and expanded to other solar systems. We've found one other current civilization (roughly WWI era; they haven't noticed us) and hints of others stretching back tens of thousands of years. Yet there's something strange: every one of them has sharp discontinuities where the clock of technology is reset.</p>
<p>One downside to this style and for this story in particular is that we only find out roughly what happened to those civilizations in the last 10% or so of the book. As an effect, the climax of the story felt rushed, with no earl impact. I know this is the first of a series and I can only hope they explore the impact of what they found a little more.</p>
<p>So far as characters, this was another weaker part of the story. I honestly don't think I could tell you anything about any of the characters I just read about (except maybe Hutch). Part of that is me--I'm not great with remembering details about people--and part is the same type-of-story thing mentioned above. Still, it's a little weird.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a neat story and in a style I enjoy reading (once I figured out that was what was going on). It was more than good enough to start in on the rest of the series. I really do want to figure out what is going on there.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/352780.Deepsix"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/2-deepsix.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Similar to the Engines of God a large chunk of the book is spent on the technology / archaeological aspects and how they interact with the story, but in this case there's also a strong thriller aspect. Things just keep going wrong (although, given that it's a novel, you can almost guess how each thing is going to go) over and over up until the climax.</p>
<p>The last section in particular was intense; I read the entire thing in one sitting--a literal page turner.</p>
<p>I liked the main characters well enough, at least as they were written. This time around, I could actually start to tell them apart, which is an upside. There are at least two who are curiously misogynistic for no reason that I could tell...</p>
<p>On a downside, we really didn't learn anything more about the Omega Waves from the previous book. And now we have some mysterious aliens who were about with advanced technology on a few thousand years ago... Perhaps we'll run into them in one of the sequels? One can hope.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382161.Chindi"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/3-chindi.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Chindi continues the trend of the previous two books in only vaguely being a sequel. It takes place after the previous two with one of the same characters (Hutch) and there are a few references to previous events... But that's about it. That's not a bad thing though.</p>
<p>This book starts with the discovery of an alien satellites around a neutron star. Hijinks ensue and people die (I'll come back to that in a second). It turns out that the satellites are part of a communication network. The next large chunk of the book follows our characters from world to world chasing after this network. (More people die). They finally end up finding a truly massive alien starship and exploring that (more people die). Then there's the climax where--just like Deepsix--our heroes have to attempt a daring / insane rescue mission so as not to leave a man behind.</p>
<p>On the plus side: I love the science aspects of the book. It's really starting to come together as a world and I like how there is some thought put into consequences. FTL travel and communication are possible, but it still takes time. Artificial gravity interacts oddly with inertia. Traveling at relativistic speeds does strange things to time. I keep turning pages, wanting to know more.</p>
<p>On the down side: It's getting increasingly hard to have sympathy for the characters. Over three books, there has been a fairly impressive body count. And almost all of them were avoidable. Over and over in this book, the author hangs a lampshade on the fact that what the characters are doing is dangerous. Off they go, and off someone dies. And yet other than a few token comments, no one seems to care. It's starting to get a bit weird.</p>
<p>Overall (and you can see by my rating), I'm still really enjoying this series. There's a definite sense of something building and the world growing and changing behind the scenes. And better, the epilogue of this book and the title of the next hint that we might just learn a bit more about the Omega Clouds from book 1! Looking forward to it.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/352781.Omega"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/4-omega.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Omega continues on in much the same vein as the previous Academy books. Science fiction in a universe where life is remarkably rare and civilization even more so. This time though... we've found someone.</p>
<p>The Omegas (clouds coming in 8000 year waves from the center of the galaxy which have a tendency to seek out and destroy right angles) return in the book, pointing directly to a new civilization. It's thousands of light years away, so there are only a limited number of ships that can possibly get there in time.</p>
<p>Hutch takes more of a backseat role this time, opening the stage to a few new characters. And just when I was finally getting to know her too. I like the new characters well enough and the death toll is at least lower this time. We'll see if they stick around in the next two books.</p>
<p>Overall, despite an entire civilization at stake, this book someone doesn't quite get as intense as those before it. Perhaps just because I've now read five of these in a row, but I can see from the outset which solutions are going to fail, which will partially succeed, and how they're finally going to save the day. It's not a problem per say, but it's getting there.</p>
<p>Final oddity (and this might have had some impact on the previous paragraph): I've actually read this book before. I'm fairly impressed that I managed to pick up and read the fourth in a series without realizing it (even if this is one series where that's not necessarily a problem) and that I didn't notice I was rereading until about 20% of the way into the book. It must have been pre-GoodReads that I last read it. Amusing.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/352775.Odyssey"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/5-odyssey.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Summary: The Academy is running out of money. In the meantime, MacAllister, a senator's daughter, a pilot, and a PR guy from the Academy are on a tour looking for UFOs because reasons. Eventually the find some (ish), the daughter gets contacted by aliens (maybe, no one believes her at first and it's never really explained), and a bunch of people die.</p>
<p>As with a few other books in this series, it takes half the book to get to what feels like the main plot point, with a massive acceleration in the last 15% and a final climax in the last 5%. It's not necessarily a bad thing, it just felt a lot more obvious in this book.</p>
<p>Especially when half the book it feels like is spent talking about how the Academy isn't getting funded any more (mirroring NASA and other modern day space programs) and an oddly large amount of the second half on a trial about a guy who went to a religious school, grew up, and punched a priest. I still haven't figured out where that came from.</p>
<p>That being said, I still enjoy the universe that McDevitt has built here. The universe actually feels big and the technology feels right. I want to believe that life will be more common than he paints it, but if it's not, this feels like how the universe might just be.</p>
<p>Once again, I hope the next book has a few more answers (we still don't know what the Omegas are and now there's a real current alien race?), but given the previous four and that #6 is the last book currently out... We'll see.</p>
<p>Edited to add: The book opens with a ship 'lost' in space because it didn't go nearly as far as it should have, despite the physicists saying that shouldn't be possible. Yet that particular weirdness is dropped and never mentioned again in favor of the 'retire the old ships because funding plot'. Weird.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/535318.Cauldron"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/6-cauldron.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Following from Omega, the Academy is basically dead (lack of funding / interest) and humanity is withdrawing from the stars. Then there's a breakthrough in new FTL drive technology orders of magnitude faster than the previous incarnations. Hutch returns as one of the two pilots sent out on a high speed mission to the origin of the Chindi, a world SETI received a transmission came from, a black hole, and the possible origin of the Omegas (finally).</p>
<p>On the upside: we finally got something in the way of answers for both where the Chindi and the Omegas came from. It's by no means a complete answer, but more than we've had thus far. I'll take it. The addition of the new drive technology promises to really shake things up. I hope this isn't the last book in the series--I want to see where this universe goes, now that you can fly to the galactic core in about four months... (As an aside, space is *huge*).</p>
<p>On a slight downside, some of the stops really felt undeveloped. What could have been an entire book earlier in the series was only a chapter or two. Even so, I think this book had the best flow of the six; I finished it in a day.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, solid science fiction. Compared to the two previous such series I've read this year, I'd put it well above <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/06/21/rama">Rama</a> (when taken as a whole) and just about even with <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/11/10/enders-game">Ender's Game</a>. That should give you a hint at how much I liked these books. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>
