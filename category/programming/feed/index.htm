<p>I think understanding this problem took longer than solving it. Originally, I thought that missing values should be treated as <code>float('inf')</code>, but they should just be ignored entirely:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>targets = {}
sues = collections.defaultdict(dict)

loading_targets = True
for line in sys.stdin:
    line = line.strip()

    if not line:
        loading_targets = False

    elif loading_targets:
        key, val = line.split(': ')
        targets[key] = int(val)

    else:
        sue, things = line.strip().split(': ', 1)
        for thing in things.split(', '):
            key, val = thing.split(': ')
            sues[sue][key] = int(val)

for sue in sues:
    valid = True

    for key in targets:
        if key in sues[sue] and sues[sue][key] != targets[key]:
            valid = False
            break

    if valid:
        print(sue)</code></pre>
<p>The longer half is correctly parsing and loading the data. For my case, I put both inputs in the same stream, separated by an empty line (similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a> and other protocols actually).</p>
<p>After that, it was just a matter of checking each Sue for the first existent but non-matching value.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Repeat the same algorithm, however assume that a Sue must have strictly more <code>cats</code> and <code>trees</code> than listed and strictly less <code>pomeranians</code> and <code>goldfish</code>.</p>
<p>For this, I introduced another <code>defaultdict</code> which contains the <code>comparators</code> to use for any given value:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>comparators = collections.defaultdict(lambda : operator.eq)
comparators['cats'] = comparators['trees'] = operator.gt
comparators['pomeranians'] = comparators['goldfish'] = operator.lt</code></pre>
<p>After that, we can change the <code>for sue in sues</code> loop to take the comparator into account:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>for sue in sues:
    valid = True

    for key in targets:
        if key in sues[sue] and not comparators[key](sues[sue][key], targets[key]):
                valid = False
                break

    if valid:
        print(sue)</code></pre>
<p>Neat.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Advent of Code: Day 15</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/15/advent-of-code-day-15" /><id>urn:uuid:cc3ed765-8159-4ad1-c41d-de1fae535ee2</id><updated>2015-12-15T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/15">Source</a></p>

<!--more-->
<p>The code is getting a bit longer, but a brute force solution still works great:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>try:
    TOTAL_QUANTITY = int(sys.argv[1])
except:
    print('Usage: cat input.txt | ./part-1.py [TOTAL_QUANTITY]')
    sys.exit(0)

ingredients = collections.defaultdict(lambda : collections.defaultdict(lambda : 0))
properties = set()

for line in sys.stdin:
    item, pairs = line.split(':')
    for pair in pairs.split(','):
        property, amount = pair.strip().split(' ')
        ingredients[item.lower()][property] = int(amount)
        properties.add(property)

items = list(sorted(ingredients.keys()))
properties.remove('calories')

def calculate_score(quantities):
    score = 1

    for property in properties:
        property_score = sum(
            quantities[item] * ingredients[item][property]
            for item in quantities
        )

        if property_score &gt; 0:
            score *= property_score

    return score

def splits(amount, count):
    if count &lt;= 1:
        yield [amount]
    else:
        for i in range(amount + 1):
            for subsplit in splits(amount - i, count - 1):
                yield [i] + subsplit

best_score = 0
best_quantities = None

for split in splits(TOTAL_QUANTITY, len(items)):
    quantities = dict(zip(items, split))
    score = calculate_score(quantities)

    if score &gt; best_score:
        best_score = score
        best_quantities = quantities

print(best_score)
print(best_quantities)]</code></pre>
<p>Essentially, there are four parts. First, we load all of the ingredients and their scores into memory. Then, <code>calculate_score</code> will take the logic described in the problem and return a score for any given quantities. Third, <code>splits</code> is a generator that will return all possible ways to divide <code>amount</code> items into <code>count</code> buckets:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>print(list(splits(5, 3)))
[[0, 0, 5],
 [0, 1, 4],
 [0, 2, 3],
 [0, 3, 2],
 [0, 4, 1],
 [0, 5, 0],
 [1, 0, 4],
 [1, 1, 3],
 [1, 2, 2],
 [1, 3, 1],
 [1, 4, 0],
 [2, 0, 3],
 [2, 1, 2],
 [2, 2, 1],
 [2, 3, 0],
 [3, 0, 2],
 [3, 1, 1],
 [3, 2, 0],
 [4, 0, 1],
 [4, 1, 0],
 [5, 0, 0]]</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we use all of those pieces to iterate over all of the possible scores. <code>dict(zip(items, split))</code> is a quick way to take two lists (of keys and values) and combine them into a dictionary.</p>
<p>I also tried to work out a solution using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithm</a>: <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/advent-of-code/blob/master/day-15/part-1-genetic.py">part-1-genetic.py</a>. It does work (in that it finds a pretty good solution), but the solution isn't optimal and it takes just as long as just brute forcing the problem. It's interesting though.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Do the same thing, only throw out any solutions that do not have a sum calorie count of exactly 500.</p>
<p>The tweak for this part is actually fairly elegant:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def calculate_score(quantities):
    ...

    calorie_count = sum(
        quantities[item] * ingredients[item]['calories']
        for item in quantities
    )
    if calorie_count != TOTAL_CALORIES:
        return float("-inf")

    ...</code></pre>
<p>Since we're looking for the largest score, returning a score that is infinitely low will skip over any invalid solutions. Other than that (and a new <code>try</code> block at the top), everything remains the same.</p>
<p>This was an interesting problem. Not quite as elegant a solution as I'd like, but it's still well within my self imposed (originally from Project Euler) 1 minute limit.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Advent of Code: Day 14</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/14/advent-of-code-day-14" /><id>urn:uuid:842a50a1-1a7f-6edb-ecb9-efaf989b031f</id><updated>2015-12-14T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/14">Source</a></p>

        data[key]['timer'] -= 1

print(max(
    (data[key]['distance'], key)
    for key in data
))</code></pre>
<p>Originally, I was going to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/priority_queue">priority queue</a> for this one. That would have let me put each next event (switching from running to resting or vice versa) in the queue and always pull off the next one to happen. Unfortunately, that made the code path right around stopping a bit complicated, since if one was running at the moment the race ends, they only update partially.</p>
<p>Instead, we just have a simulation that once per second will update the state (when <code>data[key]['timer'] == 0</code>), the distance (when )<code>not data[key]['resting']</code>), and the <code>timer</code>. Relatively straight forward. The one remaining amusing part is the ordering of the two <code>if</code> statements. If they're in the other order, you have an off-by-one problem where you should be running but have already changed state to <code>resting</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Run the same simulation, but after each round award one point to whoever is in first place (one to each in the case of ties). Determine who has the highest score.</p>
<p>For the most part, the code doesn't change. Basically, we're going to add one more field to each entry in <code>data</code>:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>data[name] = {
    ...
    'score': 0,
}</code></pre>
<p>Then we can use the same code that we had earlier to find the highest distance. Unfortunately, we cannot just increment that one because of ties; instead we have to loop:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>for tick in range(1, simulation_time + 1):
  ...

  max_distance, max_name = max((data[key]['distance'], key) for key in data)

  for key in data:
      if data[key]['distance'] == max_distance:
          data[key]['score'] += 1</code></pre>
<p>Then at the end, we print out the maximum <code>score</code> rather than <code>distance</code>.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Advent of Code: Day 13</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/13/advent-of-code-day-13" /><id>urn:uuid:3ba54996-2c7e-6568-0680-2a19a63ad1c0</id><updated>2015-12-13T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/13">Source</a></p>

<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> Given a list of seating preferences of the form <code>Alice would gain 54 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.</code> find the seating arrangement which maximizes total happiness.</p>
<!--more-->
<pre class="python"><code>happiness = collections.defaultdict(lambda : collections.defaultdict(lambda : 0))
for line in sys.stdin:
    self, gain_lose, amount, other = re.match(
        r'(\w+) would (gain|lose) (\d+) happiness units by sitting next to (\w+).',
        line
    ).groups()

    amount = int(amount)
    if gain_lose == 'lose':
        amount *= -1

    happiness[self][other] = amount

best_score, best_ordering = max(
    (
        sum(
            happiness[a][b] + happiness[b][a]
            for a, b in zip(ordering, ordering[1:] + (ordering[0],))
        ),
        ordering
    )
    for ordering in itertools.permutations(happiness.keys())
)

print(best_ordering)
print(best_score)</code></pre>
<p>I think I may have over functional'ed this one. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /> Basically, we parse everything first into a nested dictionary of happiness scores. Since we always have to add both directions in, it doesn't matter which is which in the indicies so long as it's consistent.</p>
<p>After that, we'll use the same trick as in <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/09/advent-of-code-day-9">Advent of Code: Day 9</a>: calculate pairs of scores and orderings and find the largest one. To specifically calculate the total score, we add the happiness in both directions for every pair of neighbors once again using <code>zip</code>. The only difference is that we add <code>(ordering[0],)</code> back onto the end so that we don't lose the first/last pairing of the list.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Add one more person <code>me</code>, who has a mutual happiness score of ±0 with every other person.</p>
<p>There's not actually terribly much different here, since the <code>happiness</code> structure already contains a default of 0 for any missing user. Because of that, we can just change this line:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>for ordering in itertools.permutations(happiness.keys())</code></pre>
<p>to this:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>for ordering in itertools.permutations(list(happiness.keys()) + ['me'])</code></pre>
<p>It takes a bit longer since the number of permutations grows rather quickly, but still not more than a few seconds total runtime.</p>

<p>Luckily, Python has nice CSV and JSON libraries built in:</p>
<pre class="python"><code># If --parse is set, try to parse each entry as json
def parse(thing):
    try:
        return json.loads(thing)
    except:
        return thing

# Assume that headers are the first row
reader = csv.reader(sys.stdin)
headers = None

    # Recombine the headers with each row (no one said this was saving space)
    row = dict(zip(headers, row))
    print(json.dumps(row, default = str))</code></pre>
<p>Basically, assume that the first row of the CSV data is headers (converting to a JSON dict doesn't make much sense if it isn't) and then combine that with each additional row to write out a dictionary. In addition, I put a bit of code in there to assume that you might be storing JSON in your CSV fields. If so, you can <code>--parse</code> the data automagically:</p>

<p>This is pretty similar to <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/advent-of-code-day-5">Advent of Code: Day 5</a>, although it cannot <em>quite</em> be done with purely regular expressions.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def is_valid(password):
    numeric = list(map(ord, password))

    return (
        # Include an increasing subsequence
        any(
            numeric[i] + 2 == numeric[i + 1] + 1 == numeric[i + 2]
            for i in range(len(password) - 2)
        )
        # May not contain i, o, or l
        and not any(c in password for c in 'iol')
        # Must have at least two different pairs
        and len(set(re.findall(r'(.)\1', password))) &gt;= 2
    )

def increment(password):
    numeric = list(map(ord, password))
    index = -1

    while True:
        numeric[index] += 1
        if numeric[index] &lt;= ord('z'):
            break
        else:
            numeric[index] = ord('a')
            index -= 1

    return ''.join(map(chr, numeric))

def next_valid(password):
    while True:
        password = increment(password)
        if is_valid(password):
            return password

print(next_valid(sys.argv[1]))</code></pre>
<p>Basically, there are two interesting problems: finding out if a string <code>is_valid</code> and <code>increment</code>ing one to the next value.</p>
<p>For the first, we check each of the three cases in order. We can tell if there is an ascending sequence by first converting to numeric values (<code>ord</code> will return the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unicode_codepoint">unicode codepoint</a> for a character) the comparing three adjacent values. The second test just checks if <code>any</code> character is <code>in</code> the string. The last actually does use regular expressions again to find all pairs of letters; then, by converting them into a set removes duplicates and counts unique values.</p>
<p>For the second problem (<code>increment</code>), we use the numeric form again and start at the end of the string. We'll increment each character working back towards the front of the string, stopping as soon as we don't have to carry. Then, we convert the password back into a string using the inverse of <code>ord</code>: <code>chr</code>.</p>
<p>And, that's it. It's certainly not the most efficient code, but it still takes only a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Find the next string matching the same rules after the one you found in part 1.</p>
<p>Just run the same program again on the first one's input.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Advent of Code: Day 10</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/10/advent-of-code-day-10" /><id>urn:uuid:f36a3b14-d73a-1afd-d434-17fee29644cf</id><updated>2015-12-10T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/10">Source</a></p>

<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> Given a list of distances between cities of the form <code>London to Dublin = 464</code>, calculate the shortest route that visits each city exactly once.</p>
<!--more-->
<pre class="python"><code>routes = collections.defaultdict(
  lambda : collections.defaultdict(
    lambda : float("inf")
  )
)

for line in sys.stdin:
    src, dst, dist = re.match(r'(\w+) to (\w+) = (\d+)', line).groups()
    dist = int(dist)

    routes[src][dst] = dist
    routes[dst][src] = dist

best_length, best_ordering = min(
    (sum(
      routes[src][dst]
      for src, dst in zip(ordering, ordering[1:])
    ), ordering)
    for ordering in itertools.permutations(routes.keys())
)

print(best_length)</code></pre>
<p>There are a few neat tricks here that I've used. First <code>routes</code> is defined as nested <code>defaultdict</code>, with an eventual default value of <code>float("inf")</code>. This solves two problems:</p>
<ol>
  <li>We don't have to explicitly check if a station exists before adding a route to it:

  <pre class="python"><code>routes[src][dst] = dist</code></pre>

  rather than

  <pre class="python"><code>if src in routes:
  routes[src][dst] = dist
else:
  routes[src] = {dst: dist}</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Any missing routes will have an infinite distance, which will work correctly with <code>+</code> and <code>min</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We add each distance to both <code>routes[src][dst]</code> and <code>routes[dst][src]</code> so that we don't have to worry about ordering when we calculate full routes. The other way to do this would be to sort <code>src</code> and <code>dst</code> so that <code>src < dst</code> is always true. I think this way is a little cleaner.</p>
<p>Next, we use a bunch of tools to calculate the shortest route.</p>
<p>First, <code>itertools.permutations</code> will give us every possible ordering:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pprint.pprint(list(itertools.permutations(routes.keys())))
[('London', 'Belfast', 'Dublin'),
 ('London', 'Dublin', 'Belfast'),
 ('Belfast', 'London', 'Dublin'),
 ('Belfast', 'Dublin', 'London'),
 ('Dublin', 'London', 'Belfast'),
 ('Dublin', 'Belfast', 'London')]</code></pre>
<p>Next, <code>zip</code> over <code>ordering</code> and <code>ordering[1:]</code> will give us the pairs of stations (since <code>zip</code> after exhausting its shortest argument):</p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ordering = ('Dublin', 'Belfast', 'London')
&gt;&gt;&gt; pprint.pprint(list(zip(ordering, ordering[1:])))
[('Dublin', 'Belfast'), ('Belfast', 'London')]</code></pre>
<p>Next, we can get the distance for each pairing and <code>sum</code> them all up. This is where <code>float("inf")</code> really comes in handy (although in this smaller example, we don't need it):</p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; orderings = (routes[src][dst] for src, dst in zip(ordering, ordering[1:]))
&gt;&gt;&gt; pprint.pprint(list(orderings))
[141, 518]
&gt;&gt;&gt; pprint.pprint(sum(orderings))
659</code></pre>
<p>That, we wrap up in a tuple of <code>(distance, ordering)</code> so that they are sortable. Then, apply <code>min</code> to that to find the route with the minimum distance and unpack the tuple again.</p>
<p>And that's it. Minimum distance.</p>
<p>It's certainly a brute force solution in that it will try every possible route to find the shortest one. There are probably a few dynamic programming tricks that could cut that down a bit. On the other hand, the input is relatively short (28 connections between 8 stations for a total of 40320 orderings), so just do them all.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Find the longest route.</p>
<p>Just change <code>min</code> to <code>max</code>.</p>
<p>This wouldn't work if there wasn't a connection listed between every possible station (there is in my given input, since 8 stations will have <code>8*7/2 = 28</code> connections). That's solveable though. Just use <code>float("-inf")</code> for the default distance, so that any routes with invalid stations will have an infinitely small distance.</p>
<p>This was a pretty cool problem again!</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Advent of Code: Day 8</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/08/advent-of-code-day-8" /><id>urn:uuid:843d447d-6189-6d67-4c59-7ce85e2a5d3c</id><updated>2015-12-08T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/8">Source</a></p>

    raw = line.strip()
    parsed = ast.literal_eval(raw) # This is probably cheating

    raw_count += len(raw)
    memory_count += len(parsed)

print(raw_count - memory_count)</code></pre>
<p>For a basic solution, we can cheat and use the <code>ast</code> module. It can interpret any Python literal, which includes escaped strings. Free!</p>
<p>If we actually want to do it ourselves, it's straight forward enough to use regular expressions instead:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>memory_count = 0
raw_count = 0

patterns = [
    (r'\\"', '"'),
    (r'\\\\', r'\\'),
    (r'\\x(\d\d)', chr),
    (r'^"(.*)"$', r'\1'),
]

for line in sys.stdin:
    parsed = raw = line.strip()
    for src, dst in patterns:
        parsed = re.sub(src, dst, parsed)

    print(raw, parsed)

    raw_count += len(raw)
    memory_count += len(parsed)

print(raw_count - memory_count)</code></pre>
<p>One interesting aspect is <code>chr</code>. That will convert a number such as <code>\x65</code> into the corresponding character <code>A</code>. It doesn't really matter since we just want the count, but it's kind of elegant.</p>
<p>There is a subtle bug in this, bonus points to anyone that can figure it out. But for the moment, it works great on the given test cases.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Do the opposite. Add another level of encoding such that <code>"\xa8br\x8bjr\""</code> would become <code>\"\\xa8br\\x8bjr\\\"\"</code>.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>raw_count = 0
encoded_count = 0

for line in sys.stdin:
    raw = line.strip()
    encoded = re.sub(r'(["\\])', r'\\\1', raw)

    raw_count += len(raw)
    encoded_count += len(encoded) + 2 # Quotes are not included

print(encoded_count - raw_count)</code></pre>
<p>This time since we don't have different behavior for the different escaped characters, we can use a single regular expression.</p>
