Anyways!</p><p>Another delightful season. This was a fun cast. Baba was full of chaos, Rosie got away with so much crap (sometimes literally) and her team tasks with Jack were such chaos. Andy has serious mad professor vibes (mostly the hair I suppose). Emma&mldr; Emma was my favorite.</p><p>Rosie having cerebral palsy certainly started out with a different flavor to the season. But man she has a sense of humor about the whole thing. I think it took Greg and the other contestants a minute to feel out how far to go (&ldquo;Is it too early in the series to mention I DON&rsquo;T have cerebral palsy?&rdquo; - Emma)&mldr; but once they did, that was a lot of fun.</p><blockquote><p>As you can tell by the way I talk, I suffer from being Northern. &ndash; Rosie</p></blockquote><p>Overall, what do you want? I love this show. Another great season.

Cracking herself up about the yoga ball was delightful.</p><blockquote><p>Emma: Is it too early in the series to sayâ€¦ I donâ€™t have cerebral palsy?</p></blockquote><p>Episode 1.</p><p><em>Task 3:</em> Do the most beautfiful thing with bubbles?</p><blockquote><p>Rosie: Can I get naked?</p></blockquote><p>â€¦ wat?</p><blockquote><p><em>voiceover with a French accent</em></p><p>Beauty and ze bubble. I am bubble. Am I beautiful? Tell me: what is beauty. I have dreams of what a sphere can become. But I know change changes change. And the world becomes new again. We create, though we destroy.

Bubbles doomed to die. But our beauty lives forever.</p></blockquote><p>That was delightfully weird.</p><blockquote><p>Greg Davis: I donâ€™t actually have anything negative to say.</p></blockquote><p>Yup.</p><blockquote><p>Emma: I am doing the most beautiful thing with bubbles. A beautiful babe having a bubble bath.</p></blockquote><p>Sheâ€™sâ€¦ wearing her costume in that bath?</p><blockquote><p>Greg Davis: I mean if the chocolate gobbling woman of non-descript nationality hadnâ€™t been so drunk, she might have gotten more than two points.</p></blockquote><p><em>Final task:</em> Drink the vinegar.</p><p>Oh Rosieâ€™s face.</p><p>Delightful.</p><h2 id=2--and-then-a-detective-comes---foldtrue--->2. <em>â€¦ And Then a Detective Comes</em></h2><blockquote><p>Itâ€™s prize task time.

Alex (both the singular and the plural).</p><blockquote><p>Emma: Theyâ€™re swapping bells. Swapping bells you bastards.</p></blockquote><p>Oh that got <em>creepy</em> in a hurry.</p><blockquote><p>Greg: Did you expect Baba, when you entered this show, that you would be chasing this man so that you could bite his carrot. While dressed as a hotdog.
â€¦
And did you expect to be shouting â€˜Iâ€™m the man!â€™ afterwards?</p></blockquote><p>Well, creepy and also that.</p><p><em>Task 3:</em> Pick the Taskmaster locket from Alexâ€™s coat absolutely chock full of pockets.

Could you lighten up a bit Pigeor?
Pigeor: Go fux yourself, Alex Horne.</p></blockquote><p>It gets better:</p><blockquote><p>Why did Humpty Dumpty fall of the wall?
I donâ€™t know, why?
Because he was a crack head.</p></blockquote><p>That was a delightful mess.</p><blockquote><p>Little Alex & Mr. Poo</p></blockquote><p>That â€¦ was less delightful.

â€¦
Alex: You managed to only cut the danger wire.</p></blockquote><p>lol.</p><p>The hidden â€˜DANGERâ€™ sign was pretty fun. Thereâ€™s (almost) always a derpy easy clue.</p><p><em>Live task</em>: Guess this personâ€™s job, asking yes or no questions.</p><blockquote><p>Do you chase people?
No.

Baba: What?
â€¦
Alex: And you took them off?</p></blockquote><p>So. Barrels.</p><blockquote><p>Bab: Thing was rigged.
Greg: It was rigged?
Baba: It was racist.</p></blockquote><p>Just move on from it. Talk about immortal lobsters instead.</p><blockquote><p>Rosie: But I want lobers to live forever.
Greg: Thatâ€™s not how it works Rosie.</p></blockquote><p>The absolute chaos of Emma was delightful.</p><p>And then revealing the final criteria at the endâ€¦</p><p><em>Third task</em>: Label a part of your body, making a surprising noise, do something interesting with your legs.</p><p><em>Part 2</em>: Do it again.</p><p><em>Part 3</em>: Do it again.</p><p><em>Part 4</em>: Do it again.</p><p>lol.

Bollocks!</p></blockquote><p>And then sometimes.</p><blockquote><p>Rosie: Where did fucking Gilbert come from?
(next round)
Rosie: Babatunde.</p></blockquote><p>Man that one took a while.</p><blockquote><p>Greg: Just to clarify, weâ€™re going to do thisâ€¦ for the rest of time?</p></blockquote><h2 id=9-the-cookie-children>9. <em>The Cookie Children</em></h2><p><em>Prize task</em>: The best item for keeping things in that isnâ€™t a regular item for putting things in.</p><p>Rosieâ€™s bra.</p><p>You know? It works.</p><p><em>First task</em>: Walk exactly one furlong in 10 minutes. No technology except 3 five-second phone calls.</p><p>Soâ€¦ what exactly is a furlong then? And does receiving a call count as using technology?</p><p>Iâ€™m really quite impressed with Baba in this one.</p><p><em>Second task</em>: Capture the most profound picture of a majestic nature â€¦ on a dirty thing.</p><blockquote><p>That is toxic.</p></blockquote><p>It is.</p><p>And alsoâ€¦ art?</p><p><em>Third task</em>: Place the balls in the gutter and gutter in the cow.

Fuck you.</p></blockquote><p>So much swearing in this show.</p><p>And for such reasonable reasons.</p><blockquote><p>Alex: Itâ€™s just another egg Baba.</p></blockquote><p>It was in fact just another egg.</p><h2 id=10-le-goose>10. <em>Le Goose</em></h2><p><em>Prize task</em>: Most likely to make your buttocks clench.</p><blockquote><p>Alex: Buttocks clenched and spincter closed. Nothing out nor in shall go.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Iâ€™m generally afraid of frogs. They are demons from Hell.</p></blockquote><p>â€¦ guess who. I would not have.</p><p>Ranidaphobia. TIL.</p><p>Oh Jack. That was delightful.</p><blockquote><p>Emma: Iâ€™m sorry about that, but how are your buttocks?</p></blockquote><p>â€¦ Rosie wins.</p><blockquote><p>Greg: You monster.</p></blockquote><p><em>First task</em>: How many chairs are in the cinema? (Give one answer, say no numbers, say the name of every object on screen, each number off will add one minute).</p><p>Soâ€¦ how many of them said <em>ten</em> minutes. (I guess the timer hadnâ€™t started yet).</p><p>Rosie went through and touched every single chair.</p><blockquote><p>Rosie: Three. (gasp)
Alex: I didnâ€™t quite hear that.
Rosie (quietly): Hedgehogs.</p></blockquote><p>And of course thereâ€™s a hidden answer, but man that was a tricky one.</p><p><em>Second task</em>: Either through five fives in a row, do 100 push-ups, eat a raw onion, or sit silently for 10 minutes. You may only attempt two of these things.</p><blockquote><p>Didnâ€™t have to eat any nasty ass raw onionsâ€¦
(cuts to Rosie eating the onion <em>after</em> she dumps them)</p></blockquote><p>Andyâ€¦ added up to five pips on each face.</p><blockquote><p>Emma: Iâ€™ve said this before and Iâ€™ll say it again. Alex gets cute and scared around Jack.</p></blockquote><p>The haystack was delightfully cute though. And only Emma even considered it.</p><p>Emma is a lot of fun.</p><p><em>Third task</em>: Present <em>The Goose</em>.</p><blockquote><p>Baba: What.
â€¦
Who comes up with this stuff bro?</p></blockquote><p>That was a weird task.</p><p><em>Live task</em>: When Greg says <em>eyes down</em> look down, when he says <em>eyes up</em> look at another contestant. If two constestants are looking at each other, you are eliminated.</p><p>That actually looks pretty fun. These live tasks are such chaos sometimes.</p><p>And so it ends. A good season!</p></div></article></div></div><footer id=page-footer role=contentinfo><nav id=footer-navigation role=navigation class=ribbon><ul class=main-navigation><li><a href=/archive-by-date/>All posts: By Date</a></li><li><a href=/archive-by-tag/>All posts: By Tag</a></li><li><a href=/atom.xml>RSS: All <sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li><li><a href=/reviews/atom.xml>RSS: reviews<sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li></ul></nav><div id=page-footer-content data-pagefind-ignore=all><div class=legal><p>All posts unless otherwise mentioned are licensed under
