This belief takes many forms: for instance, Native Hawaiians believe it summons the Hukai’po, the spirits of ancient warriors, and Native Mexicans say it calls Lechuza, a witch that can transform into an owl. But what all these legends hold in common is the certainty that whistling at night can cause evil spirits to appear—and even follow you home.</p></blockquote><p>A collection of two dozen horror (and otherwise dark fiction) stories by a wide variety of indigenous authors.

Overall, it&rsquo;s a fascinating new look (for me) into all sorts of new and interesting creepy things.</p><p>And all too often, you might just find that people are people. And people are scarier than any monster out there.</p><blockquote><p>So, for these next pages, let these writers take you by the hand, lead you into the darkness at the heart of—let me put some quotation marks around it—“America.”</p></blockquote><hr><p>Reviews for individual stories (my favorites are marked with ‡):</p><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#kushtuka-by-mathilda-zeller><em>Kushtuka</em> by Mathilda Zeller</a></li><li><a href=#white-hills-by-rebecca-roanhorse><em>White Hills</em> by Rebecca Roanhorse</a></li><li><a href=#navajos-don-by-conley-lyons><em>Navajos Don&rsquo;t Wear Elk Teeth</em> by Conley Lyons</a></li><li><a href=#wingless-by-marcie-r-rendon><em>Wingless</em> by Marcie R.

Fine.” I wracked my brain, but in the darkness, I could think of nothing bright and benign. “There was once a girl named Sedna. Her father threw her over the edge of his fishing boat. She tried to save herself by catching on to the edge of the boat, but he brought a knife down onto her fingers and cut them all off. They became the first seals, walruses, whales. She became the goddess of the Underworld.”</p></blockquote><h2 id=white-hills-by-rebecca-roanhorse><em>White Hills</em> by Rebecca Roanhorse</h2><blockquote><p>Marissa doesn’t follow sports, but she knows what he’s talking about. She’s seen people complaining about “The Chop” on TikTok, read an article about Indian mascots in Vogue. She raises her voice so everyone can hear.

Is it any different cause they&rsquo;re both men?</p><blockquote><p>Grandpa gave a sharp, ugly laugh. “ ’Cause if you’re cornered, you’re desperate.

Remember what my mom said?”</p><p>“Only Netflix and chill on the rez. Got it,” Amber said.</p></blockquote><h2 id=hunger-by-phoenix-boudreau-><em>Hunger</em> by Phoenix Boudreau ‡</h2><blockquote><p>It is always hungry. In the time Before the Other People came, the original People’s stories about it had given it its own form. The People wouldn’t dare to say its name in the dark; they whispered its stories to one another and their reverent fear sustained it. The People had called it a spirit of evil, but it has only ever been hungry. The modern People have forgotten; Other People came and erased its stories, tried to pretend it didn’t exist. But it has always been here and always will be. It is as inevitable as the Land itself.

He said what we’d come there to say and now it felt dangerous.“</p><p>“ ‘Are you sure you want to hear my scariest story?’ she asked us.</p></blockquote><p>A good way to get some work done at least.</p><p>Side note: I hadn&rsquo;t heard this one before of the apocryphal story about Christopher Columbus referring to the indigenous people he encountered as &ldquo;Los Indios&rdquo; (The Indians) as a shortened form of &ldquo;una gente en Dios&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;a people in God&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=human-eaters-by-royce-k-young-wolf-><em>Human Eaters</em> by Royce K.

The city sighed along, settler sons and daughters telling its tale for a while, but not forever.</p></blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s such a description.</p><p>And then suddenly bag of heads.</p><blockquote><p>That tracks, doesn’t it? Do any of us exist, after all, unless or until we’re called to do so? Are we really alive if someone isn’t dreaming us into existence?

Mom worried about all the gruesome images, asked my grandfather if this was okay, and he said it was. “I like it, doosis,” he said. “It’s comforting that they suffer more than me.” A laugh. His laugh. When she had gone to work, I asked if that were true, and he said “Yes.” I wondered if the movies gave him nightmares. They gave me nightmares, but I loved them. They felt like training simulations.</p></blockquote><p>So of course he asks:</p><blockquote><p>“There’s gotta be a word,” I said.</p><p>He thought. “If there is, I don’t know it.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>He thought again. Or maybe he was just trying to catch his breath. “Nὰka, maybe.”</p><p>“Nὰka?” I repeated. “What’s that?”</p><p>“The former living.”</p><p>“So it means zombie?”</p><p>“No, not in that sense.”</p></blockquote><p>And then you get those times where humanity is the creepy part after all.</p><h2 id=uncle-robert-rides-the-lightning-by-kate-hart><em>Uncle Robert Rides the Lightning</em> by Kate Hart</h2><blockquote><p>But the burglars shoved the fridge against the door and ran out the back, taking some jewelry and some other small things with them.

His skin, his jeans, his jacket, his shoes. Heart, lungs, brain, bowels, teeth—it all came to one hundred and fifty-eight pounds. All the blood left in him came to that. So how much would he have weighed if he hadn’t lost any to the ground, to the cracks in the blacktop? Either way, most of all that rose up as smoke, and now we’re left with the four pounds of him that remain.</p></blockquote><p>And the real horror story?</p><blockquote><p>I fell apart. I lost my job. Clay Mound Elementary offers two personal days a year to all teachers. I burned through those, hardly noticing them pass. The administration figured it was easier to replace me.

When Carl said it, it was filled with an admiration for the American Indian that he had learned from his German mother and Walt could forgive that. When JohnBoy said it, it was full of the mockery of a man whose family had stolen your land.</p></blockquote><p>There wolf.</p><h2 id=capgras-by-tommy-orange-><em>Capgras</em> by Tommy Orange ‡</h2><blockquote><p>Between my staggering and hunching, I must have left the plane looking like Dr. Frankenstein’s assistant, Fritz, so often mistakenly thought of as Igor.

Liked the way my relatives’ faces lit up as they retold the capture of their prize. And I grew used to the glassy eyes that watched my every move. Death lived in those houses like an old friend, like she was one of us, a member of the Cloud family.</p></blockquote><p>Heads on the wall.
