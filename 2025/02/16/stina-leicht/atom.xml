Add in a cast of criminals and mercenaries and all sorts of characters that don&amp;rsquo;t get overmuch representation in the Sci-Fi of old (Lesbian, bi, and non-binary, oh my. And honestly, a cast of entirely women in the first place). And more than a touch of an exploration of Artificial General Intelligence&amp;ndash;possible even more relevant with the current scope and expansion of LLMs&amp;ndash;and you have quite a story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed it. It&amp;rsquo;s a mix of older tropes and newer characters. For the most part, the story went as I was expecting, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a bad thing. And it was a fun listen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think my biggest pain point is that if anything, Persephone Station tries to do too much. I particularly like books exploring truly alien aliens and machine minds&amp;ndash;and comparing and contrasting how they think and how we think about them thinking. There are hints of that here, but it could have been so much more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, I enjoyed it and think it worth a listen. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
