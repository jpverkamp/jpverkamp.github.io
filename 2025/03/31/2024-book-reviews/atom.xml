&lt;p>Luck is a fairy tale we use to make people feel better about the world being unfair as shit.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Man this book has come a ways since &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/07/05/the-city-of-brass/">The City of Brass&lt;/a>. At first we had a fairly straight forward portal fantasy: normal human girl goes through a portal (ish) to another world, discovers magic, and has adventures (again; ish). Then things escalate. Political intrigue. Old enemies. Revolution. War.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now&amp;hellip; Daevabad has fallen. Nahri and Ali are on the run, trying desperately first to survive and then&amp;hellip; maybe, to come back and save the day. And perhaps learn all those dirty little secrets those (formerly) in power tried hard to hide all these years.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I do not believe ambitious men who say the only route to peace and prosperity lies in giving them more power—particularly when they do it with lands and people who are not theirs.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I love the characters. Especially Dara, but the whole Nahri and Ali journey was great to read. And I even foundmyself rooting for Muntadhir, which after the previous books&amp;hellip; I did not expect). Manizheh&amp;hellip; I think Ghassan was a better villain overall, and it&amp;rsquo;s interesting that she made it as far as she did, but so it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I still love the worldbuilding&amp;ndash;even if I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em>still after 3 books&lt;/em> not 100% sure what is a subset of what and who is a when. But I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s the point. Reality is messy. But it&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating world and I&amp;rsquo;m sad to be leaving it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall it&amp;rsquo;s a solid conclusion to a great series. I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to read more in this world, but I&amp;rsquo;m always glad to see a series actually get it&amp;rsquo;s own small end, rather than just fading out as many do.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Find your happiness, little thief. Steal it and do not ever let it go.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Iron Council</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/30/iron-council/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/30/iron-council/</guid><description>&lt;p>[[Perdido Street Station|One in a city]], [[The Scar|one on a boat]]&amp;hellip; and now one based around an entire civilization built around a &amp;lsquo;perpetual train&amp;rsquo;, putting down rails as it goes (and at times, tearing them up behind it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/30/china-mi%C3%A9ville/">China Miéville&lt;/a> has some bonkers worldbuilding ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I mean course you want a change, we want a change, but if a change ain’t godsdamn coming, then the next thing I wish is that I didn’t care.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Beyond that, we have a whole book about political oppression and xenophobia (the Iron Council is initially founded by the remade working on the train). It&amp;rsquo;s about the tension of a revolution that feels inevitable. We have a story about gender differences (in a world where sexual dimorphism is a huge deal for some species) and love and longing. And a story about future history. The messy way of how one ends up getting history books written about them.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“History&amp;hellip;” Jacobs spoke with terse authority. Brought Ori to a hush. “Is all full. And dripping. With the corpses. Of them who trusted the incorruptible.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also interesting to see the fallout of the &amp;lsquo;Contruct Uprising&amp;rsquo;. A direct consequence of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/04/perdido-street-station/">Perdido Street Station&lt;/a>. And now instead, we have &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golems">golems&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;which in this world can be made by animating any sorts of bits of innanimate matter and giving them life/instructions. It&amp;rsquo;s cool!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, I think this may be the weakest of the three. Despite how cool an idea a &amp;lsquo;perpetual train&amp;rsquo; is, I think the story spends too much time on other people/places/things. It&amp;rsquo;s all building up, but when one of the things I love the most (and always start by describing) is left wanting? That&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a bummer. It&amp;rsquo;s still fascinating and there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of it&amp;hellip; but I wanted more!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Whispers Under Ground</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/29/whispers-under-ground/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/29/whispers-under-ground/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ghosts! Goblins! Murder! The FBI (in London)! The LONDON UNDERGROUND!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do continue to really love the feel of these books. It &lt;em>feels&lt;/em> like a British cop show with a combination of magical elements and the science of magic, which are all delightful things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly the same, although this time around, we get a lot more of Lesley stepping up to learn magic again, which is something I was hoping would happen. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how those two grow together.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That was Seawoll,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Stephanopoulos is on her way down and you’re not to do anything stupid until she gets here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You burn down one central London tourist attraction, I thought, and they never let you forget it.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also interesting seeing the bits of London as a city built on people from all manners, histories, and walks of life.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My mum translated this in her head to &amp;ldquo;witchfinder,&amp;rdquo; which was good because like most West Africans, she considered witchfinding a more respectable profession than policeman.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worldbuildingwise, I like seeing ever more of teh magical world of London. There really is a feel of &amp;rsquo;this &lt;em>could&lt;/em> be&amp;rsquo; that urban fantasy doesn&amp;rsquo;t always get right. And I enjoy finding out that even the magical folks don&amp;rsquo;t know how a lot of what they do works, but our main character is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> going to let that stand.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is why magic is worse even than quantum physics. Because, while both spit in the eye of common sense, I&amp;rsquo;ve never yet had a Higgs bosun turn up and try to have a conversation with me.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s fun to see even more of the magical underground (literally). It&amp;rsquo;s neat to see how different authors play with old stories (and make up their own!)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“My dad was a fairy,&amp;quot; said Zach. &amp;ldquo;And by that I don&amp;rsquo;t mean he dressed well and enjoyed musical theatre.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>One oddity: There are a ton of Lord of the Rings references throughout this book, some blatent and some more subtle. I was really fully expecting that to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%e2%80%99s%20gun">Chekhov’s gun&lt;/a>&amp;hellip; but they were just references all along? That seems weird to me and I can&amp;rsquo;t quite my finger on why.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I loved it and am looking forward to the next one! Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alcatraz Versus the Scrivener's Bones</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/20/alcatraz-versus-the-scriveners-bones/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/20/alcatraz-versus-the-scriveners-bones/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Once there was a bunny. This bunny had a birthday party. It was the bestest birthday party ever. Because that was the day the bunny got a bazooka.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bunny loved his bazooka. He blew up all sorts of things on the farm. He blew up the stable of Henrietta the Horse. He blew up the pen of Pugsly the Pig. He blew up the coop of Chuck the Chicken.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I have the bestest bazooka ever,&amp;rdquo; the bunny said. Then the farm friends proceeded to beat him senseless and steal his bazooka. It was the happiest day of his life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Epilogue: Pugsly the Pig, now without a pen, was quite annoyed. When none of the others were looking, he stole the bazooka. He tied a bandana on his head and swore vengeance for what had been done to him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;From this day on,&amp;rdquo; he whispered, raising the bazooka, &amp;ldquo;I shall be known as Hambo.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/10/alcatraz-versus-the-evil-librarians/">Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians&lt;/a> introduced us to the world, now in Alcatraz Versus the Scrivener&amp;rsquo;s Bones we actually get to live in it! A bit. Sort of.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>(Hushlanders, it might be noted, aren’t very imaginative with their idioms. Personally, I say, “Out of the frying pan and into the deadly pit filled with sharks who are wielding chainsaws with killer kittens stapled to them.” However, that one’s having a rough time catching on.)&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Essentially, the entire book is an adventure where Alcatraz and co (Bastille, but also newcomers Australia&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and Kaz) are on a mission to mention a recently missing Grandpa Smedry. One thing leads to another, they end up in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library%20of%20Alexandria">Library of Alexandria&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;which got totally Tardis&amp;rsquo;ed&amp;ndash;and discover all sorts of spooky ghosts, ancient scrolls, hidden messages, &amp;hellip; and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Not all librarians are evil cultists. Some librarians are instead vengeful undead who want to suck your soul.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>Wonderland</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/02/wonderland/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/12/02/wonderland/</guid><description>&lt;p>I actually picked up this book the day I voted in the election. A three hour line at the local library where you&amp;rsquo;ve run out of podcasts will do that to you. &amp;#x1f604; Mostly, the cover looked neat, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give it a chance. Which makes this only the second physical (non-children&amp;rsquo;s) book I&amp;rsquo;ve read in probably a decade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For better or (and) for worse, the book is billed as &amp;lsquo;if &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/04/11/shirley-jackson/">Shirley Jackson&lt;/a> wrote The Shining&amp;rsquo;, which&amp;hellip; this is not. It does have a family moved out deep into the wilderness, away from the city they&amp;rsquo;ve always loved, thrown into land where somehow you can get &amp;hellip; feet of unexpected snow? And a tree that may or may not be talking to you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mostly, I think it feels not quite finished. There are some decently creepy scenes in the book, but it never quite ramped up for me. The hallucinations the family goes through are certainly disconcerting but, barring one, they don&amp;rsquo;t really seem to be all that dangerous. I did like that it was never entirely clear what was hallucination and what was &lt;em>real&lt;/em> though, that was a nice touch. Then, by the time things really start falling apart, we have sudden violence/death that doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>really&lt;/em> land and an ending that wrapped up all too suddenly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will say that I did enjoy the descriptions of the mountain wilderness and their new home. I would have liked to explore that more. It felt &lt;em>wild&lt;/em>, which I appreciated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, being only the second physical book I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a &lt;em>long&lt;/em> while and a hardcover at that, it really did have a nice tactile feel to it and I was enjoying the book enough to read it all the way through, so I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly come across worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moon Over Soho</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/28/moon-over-soho/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/28/moon-over-soho/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/05/rivers-of-london/">Rivers of London&lt;/a> got the introduction out of the way, so now it&amp;rsquo;s time for Moon Over Soho to really build out the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really love seeing Grant exploring the magic of the world. He&amp;rsquo;s doing &lt;em>science&lt;/em> to &lt;strong>magic&lt;/strong>. I do enjoy books that do that. (Plus, it&amp;rsquo;s funny!)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I had jokingly developed my own scale for vestigia based on the amount of noise Toby made when he interacted with any residual magic. I called it a yap, one yap being enough vestigia to be apparent even when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The yap would be an SI unit, of course, and thus the standard background ambience of a Central London pub was 0.2 of a yap (0.2Y) or 200 milliyaps (200mY).&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Also, more worldbuilding about what the &amp;lsquo;Rivers&amp;rsquo; are (fae? or at least fae adjacent). More talk about vampires. And of course&amp;hellip; What&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;em>deal&lt;/em> with Nightingale?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“What&amp;rsquo;s the biggest thing you&amp;rsquo;ve zapped with a fireball?&amp;rsquo; I asked.&lt;br>
&amp;lsquo;That would be a tiger,&amp;lsquo;said Nightingale.&lt;br>
&amp;lsquo;Well don&amp;rsquo;t tell Greenpeace,&amp;rsquo; I said. &amp;lsquo;They&amp;rsquo;re an endagered species.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br>
&amp;lsquo;Not that sort of tiger,&amp;rsquo; said Nightingale. &amp;lsquo;A Panzer-kampfwagen sechs Ausf E.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br>
I stared at him. &amp;lsquo;You knocked out a Tiger tank with a fireball?&amp;rsquo;&lt;br>
&amp;lsquo;Actually I knocked out two,&amp;rsquo; said Nightingale. &amp;lsquo;I have to admit that the first one took three shots, one to disable the tracks, one through the driver&amp;rsquo;s eye slot and one down the commander&amp;rsquo;s hatch - brewed up rather nicely.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Plus, we get piles more London, this time around digging into the musical/jazz scenes. I managed to go through the first book entirely expecting Grant&amp;rsquo;s parents to be out of the picture (that&amp;rsquo;s just the way urban fantasy always seems to go), so it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see them on page and actually playing interesting roles in the story!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My Dad says that being a Londoner has nothing to do with where you&amp;rsquo;re born. He says that there are people who get off a jumbo jet at Heathrow, go through immigration waving any kind of passport, hop on the tube and by the time the train&amp;rsquo;s pulled into Piccadilly Circus they&amp;rsquo;ve become a Londoner.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Weirdest change of this series: Grant falls quickly and &lt;em>deeply&lt;/em> in &lt;del>love&lt;/del> lust with someone (from a case!) and there are a number of decently explicit on screen sex scenes. I didn&amp;rsquo;t necessary see that one coming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also plotwise, I was &amp;hellip; surprised by the ending. Not in who the big bad ended up being, more more what happened after that. It felt sudden and perhaps unearned, like we&amp;rsquo;d reached the end of the book and had to warp things up. I&amp;rsquo;m curious if we&amp;rsquo;ll get any fallout of that in future books, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really expect to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did really like the scenes with Leslie though (from the first book), especially&amp;ndash;and counter to my first point&amp;ndash;her ending. That&amp;hellip; now &lt;strong>that&lt;/strong> has some interesting potential for the series.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Gwen, Vol. 4: Predators</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/24/spider-gwen-vol.-4-predators/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/24/spider-gwen-vol.-4-predators/</guid><description>&lt;p>Okay, after &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/24/spider-man/spider-gwen-sitting-in-a-tree/">Sitting in a Tree&lt;/a>, back to our regularly scheduled Spider-Gwen!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>lol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then of course, as these things do everything escalated. Harry/Lizard. Venom. Mr. Murderhands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the chaos!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main Spider-Gwen storyline was getting a bit weak there, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see this as a return to form. I&amp;rsquo;m really curious what happens next here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My thoughts exactly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Issues 16 and 17 of Spider-Gwen are apparently a crossover with Spider-Man… so here we go?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course we go right from the above to “Miles’ dad is missing”, so I’m not entirely sure this is going to be a helpful aside for Spider-Gwen. We shall see!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/sitting-in-a-tree-textbundle-657260.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>… seriously?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Scar</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/22/the-scar/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/22/the-scar/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Scars are not injuries, Tanner Sack. A scar is a healing. After injury, a scar is what makes you whole.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Okay, I really thought that &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/04/perdido-street-station/">Perdido Street Station&lt;/a> was one of a kind. A dark, twisted magical world, full of strange creatures, stranger magic, and some truly weird and terrible things lurking just under the surface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, &lt;em>The Scar&lt;/em> manged to do quite the job proving me wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First off, we have the setting. In Perdido Street Station, the city of New Crobuzon itself was as much as a character in the stories as any of the, well, characters. So imagine my surprise where the city is only barely mentioned this time around: instead, we have Armada, a mighty floating city built on the back of untold years of captured (and otherwise) ships lashed all together.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Vessels knocked together for hour upon hour, like bones, like someone infinitely stupid and patient at the door of an empty house.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And deep under this city? Mile long chains, designed to harness&amp;hellip; &lt;em>something&lt;/em> to the city.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>So many truths have been kept from me. This violent, pointless voyage has been sopping with blood. I feel thick and sick with it. And that is all: contingent and brutal without meaning. There is nothing to be learnt here. No ecstatic forgetting. There is no redemption in the sea.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s not even getting into dead languages, weapsons and fighting styles that harness Possibility itself, a race of deadly mosquito people, and all the other terrors one might find on (and under) the ocean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then the characters. Bellis Coldwine, a linguist of all things (I love linguistics). An acquaintances of Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin&amp;rsquo;s (I love that name) on the run after the whole Slakemoth thing. Stuck on Armada, just looking for a way home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Silas Fennec. A traveler and so much more from New Crobuzon, with his fingers (and tongue (you&amp;rsquo;ll see)) in just about everything going on one way or another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tanner Sack. A Remade, fully adapted to life on&amp;ndash;and in&amp;ndash;the sea around Armada.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Uther Doul. A mysterious figure with truly &lt;em>weird&lt;/em> sword.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lovers. Rulers of Armada. Referred to in text as &amp;lsquo;The Lover&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;The Lover&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just love how strange and &lt;em>different&lt;/em> Miéville manages to write characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the deepest places, where physical norms collapse under the crushing water, bodies still fall softly through the dark, days after their vessels have capsized. They decay on their long journey down. Nothing will hit the black sand at the bottom of the world but algae-covered bones.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Overall, if anything I like &lt;em>The Scar&lt;/em> even &lt;strong>more&lt;/strong> than I did &lt;em>Perdido Street Station&lt;/em>. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what&amp;rsquo;s next!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Gwen, Vol. 2: Weapon of Choice</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/20/spider-gwen-vol.-2-weapon-of-choice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/20/spider-gwen-vol.-2-weapon-of-choice/</guid><description>&lt;p>And&amp;hellip; after &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/18/spider-women/">Spider-Women&lt;/a>, we&amp;rsquo;re back!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two (ish) volumes in and we already have the crisis of faith/lost powers one. Whee!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Kraven no less. Such an odd villain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time running out for Gwen, Castle on her tail—and on the edge it seems—and Captain Stacy has a solution. Luckily, Gwen made friends with… Reed Richards?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intense. Curious how long this lasts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Also, that’s certainly an art style. It’s jarring in most crossovers but even more so in this one for some reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea of Jessica Drew’s alternate Agent Drew being a man is somewhat amusing, given her Ultimate version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s fascinating to see someone so potentially character defining to Spider-Gwen—&lt;span class="spoiler">like losing her powers!&lt;/span>

&lt;p>In this universe, Peter Parker wanted to be a hero and got killed for it. So… why is the Lizard apparently still running around?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, the Green Goblin!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much in this world built around a the severe ‘not what it looks like’ of Peter’s death. Strains incredulity… but that’s comics. And it (so far) is working for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The introduction of this world’s Captain America was fun. I appreciate the quick backstory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Likewise Harry Osborne. Dungeons and Dragons nerds unite!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m enjoying this series.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So here we have Spider-Gwen. An alternate Spider Gwen Stacy! Her dad’s a cop (hunting her) and life is complicated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have a small pile of villains—mostly a Vulture, but also Kingpin, Frank Castle, and Matt Murdoch. Ambiguous at both. I’m curious where it goes from here!&lt;/p>

Let&amp;rsquo;s remedy that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Short version: Alcatraz reminds me a decent bit of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/27/the-frugal-wizards-handbook-for-surviving-medieval-england/">Frugal Wizard&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;which was actually my least favorite of the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/23/year-of-sanderson/">Year of Sanderson&lt;/a> secret projects. But so far at least, I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying this series quite a bit more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Slightly longer version:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the Hushlands—those Librarian-controlled nations such as the United States, Canada, and England—this book will be published as a work of fantasy. Do not be fooled! This is no work of fiction, nor is my name really Brandon Sanderson. Both are guises to hide the book from Librarian agents. Unfortunately, even with these precautions, I suspect that the Librarians will discover the book and ban it. In that case, our Free Kingdom Agents will have to sneak into libraries and bookstores to put it on shelves. Count yourself lucky if you’ve found one of these secret copies.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a (non-&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/11/23/the-cosmere/">Cosmere&lt;/a>) YA novel &amp;lsquo;written by&amp;rsquo; our titular Alcatraz as he learns that the world he&amp;rsquo;s always known is full of lies (perpetrated by a cabal of EVIL LIBRARIANS) who are now, of course, out to capture and/or kill him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As one does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>impressively&lt;/em> meta, with almost constant comments from Alcatraz as narrator, talking about writers, writing, fiction, and just about anything else.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Authors also create lovable, friendly characters, then proceed to do terrible things to them, like throw them in unsightly librarian-controlled dungeons. This makes readers feel hurt and worried for the characters. The simple truth is that authors like making people squirm. If this weren&amp;rsquo;t the case, all novels would be filled completely with cute bunnies having birthday parties.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Which, from my perspective as both a reader and writer myself, is amusing, but feels like it might be a bit weirder / too meta for a much younger reader?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t believe what I&amp;rsquo;m telling you, then ask yourself this: would any decent, kind-hearted individual become a writer? Of course not.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well, so far my children are enjoying it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I suppose we&amp;rsquo;ll see where we go from here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worldbuildingwise, we haven&amp;rsquo;t learned &lt;em>that&lt;/em> much about how &amp;lsquo;magic&amp;rsquo; works in this world (we already have technology based almost entirely on glass along with &amp;lsquo;Talents&amp;rsquo;, which seem somewhat chaotic). That&amp;rsquo;s kind of Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>thing&lt;/em>, so I expect a lot more there. The world is chaotic and strains believability when it comes to &amp;lsquo;could you &lt;em>actually&lt;/em> have a hidden world like this&amp;rsquo; but&amp;hellip; suspend disbelief and GO WITH IT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not actually sure how &lt;em>much&lt;/em> I like Alcatraz. So far, I like supporting cast Grandpa Smedry and Bastille quite a bit more. I expect that&amp;rsquo;s kind of the point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, enjoyed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to ADHD: An Insider's Guide to Working with Your Brain</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/05/how-to-adhd-an-insiders-guide-to-working-with-your-brain/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/05/how-to-adhd-an-insiders-guide-to-working-with-your-brain/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Be yourself!&lt;br>
…No, not like that!&lt;br>
— SOCIETY&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Brains are weird yo. The older I get/the more I learn, the more true I find this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reading books like this (or alternatively &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/07/welcome-to-the-autistic-community/">this&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/18/look-me-in-the-eye-my-life-with-aspergers/">Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger’s&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/20/born-on-a-blue-day/">Born on a Blue Day&lt;/a>) helps. Discovering that there are other weird brains out there (I do love McCabe&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;hello brains&amp;rsquo;) is wonderful. Seeing both how they see the world the same&amp;ndash;and perhaps even more so, the differences even within these groups&amp;ndash;is like a lightbulb going off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Specifically for this one, the idea that just because you are (/ appear to be) succeeding at life&amp;hellip; doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that it&amp;rsquo;s not coming at a cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The fact that I could sometimes exceed expectations made it even more frustrating for me—and everyone around me—when I failed to meet the basic ones.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I think that if you have ADHD&amp;ndash;or have someone close to you that does&amp;hellip; and chances are &lt;em>really&lt;/em> good that you do, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t know it&amp;ndash;I think this book is worth a read.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>ADHD is a terrible name for the condition, because &amp;lsquo;attention deficit&amp;rsquo; implies a lack of attention. However, our brains can focus quite well sometimes&amp;ndash;particularly on things we find engaging, such as our hobbies, crushes, video games, and so on. The trouble is, we can&amp;rsquo;t control the intensity of our focus or what we focus on. . . . This big misconception makes people less likely to seek a diagnosis because they are able to focus sometimes.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Explanations, tools to deal / adapt to a world that isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily built for you, and a ton of quotes from a ton of people.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Over the years, we’ve shared long, deep discussions about what it means to have ADHD. About how being “normal” isn’t a realistic goal but being functional is. About how sometimes, paradoxically, being functional means behaving in less (neuro)typical ways, so we can be more mentally healthy, happy, and generous humans for ourselves and for those we love.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well worth the read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rivers of London</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/01/rivers-of-london/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/11/01/rivers-of-london/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whenever I come across a &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve read all of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/10/07/the-dresden-files/">The Dresden Files&lt;/a>, now what?&amp;rdquo; discussion, one of the series that always seems to come up is Ben Aaronovitch&amp;rsquo;s Rivers of London. They&amp;rsquo;re not &lt;em>entirely&lt;/em> the same, but I get why people cross recommend them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, we have a London cop who stumbles upon a mysterious killing, questions a ghost, gets recruited by the &amp;lsquo;magical&amp;rsquo; side of the London police, ends up meeting and befriending several rivers (see, the title! Also, it ends up making more sense in the story), and saves the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Are they really gods?&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I never worry about theological questions,&amp;rdquo; said Nightingale. &amp;ldquo;They exist, they have power and they can breach the Queen&amp;rsquo;s peace - that makes them a police matter.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>More or less.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think my favorite part of the series (so far) is the humor, most especially the sheer Britishness of it (not being British, I have no idea how accurate it all is, but it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for me!).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>He was from Yorkshire, or somewhere like that, and like many Northerners with issues, he&amp;rsquo;d moved to London as a cheap alternative to psychotherapy.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh, and also picking fun at it&amp;rsquo;s own genre of course.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“You put a spell on the dog,&amp;rdquo; I said as we left the house.&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;Just a small one,&amp;rdquo; said Nightingale.&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;So magic is real,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;Which makes you a&amp;hellip;what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;A wizard.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;Like Harry Potter?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
Nightingale sighed. &amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Not like Harry Potter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;In what way?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not a fictional character,&amp;rdquo; said Nightingale.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Second up, the introductions of magic. Any world where the characters try to treat magic as a science and figure out &lt;em>how in the world it &lt;strong>really&lt;/strong> works&lt;/em> is a great one in my book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s an &lt;em>awful&lt;/em> lot of hinted at worldbuilding there. I hope and expect to see a lot more of that in future books. We&amp;rsquo;ll just have to see which way all that goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also also, having recently decided that learning Latin was just a great idea as our main character (although for (un)fortunately different reasons I suppose):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Carved above the lintel were the words SCIENTIA POTESTAS EST. Science points east, I wondered? Science is portentous, yes? Science protests too much. Scientific potatoes rule. Had I stumbled on the lair of dangerous plant geneticists?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spoilers, I guess. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I had a lot of fun with this book. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing where it goes from here!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Other Minds</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/31/other-minds/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/31/other-minds/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals. Because our most recent common ancestor was so simple and lies so far back, cephalopods are an independent experiment in the evolution of large brains and complex behavior. If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of a shared history, not because of kinship, but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Octopuses&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> are perhaps the best known example of what might be a truly &lt;em>alien&lt;/em> intelligence on Earth. They&amp;rsquo;re far further from humanity than primates or dolphins or even birds. And man. They&amp;rsquo;re weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This book digs into the history of life itself, the beginning of what would eventually become brains, and how life eventually split and branched into all the myriad forms we have today.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the Ediacaran, other animals might be there around you, without being especially relevant. In the Cambrian, each animal becomes an important part of the environment of others. This entanglement of one life in another, and its evolutionary consequences, is due to behavior and the mechanisms controlling it. From this point on, the mind evolved in response to other minds.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This part? Very interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also get some fascinating discussions about some of the weirder things octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish do. Color changing, shape shifting, and independently acting arms. They have it all.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Suppose some light-sensitive cells sit below a layer of many chromatophores. As chromatophores of different colors expanded and contracted, the light passing through them would be affected in different ways. If the animal kept track of which chromatophores were expanded, as well as how much light was reaching its sensors, it could know something about the color of incoming light.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Also cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Octopus society. A surprisingly short lived and solitary species, and yet still in one case, they&amp;rsquo;ve actually built something of a city in the ocean off Australia.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A marine research unit at Monterey Bay, California (MBARI), explores deep-sea environments with remote-controlled submarines that carry video cameras. In 2007 they were inspecting a rocky outcrop nearly a mile underwater, off the coast of central California. They saw a deep-sea octopus (Graneledone boreopacifica) moving around. Returning a month or so later, they found the same octopus guarding a clutch of eggs. They kept returning to the site to watch the progress of this clutch of eggs, and always found the octopus there. In the end they watched this one octopus for four and a half years. This octopus brooded her eggs for longer than any other known octopus is thought to live in total, and the fifty-three months it spent there is the longest egg-brooding period reported for any animal species.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Fascinating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then also a dive into consciousness. Which&amp;hellip; we can barely explain or define what consciousness means for people, let alone verify it&amp;rsquo;s presence in any other species.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s entirely philosophical and not &lt;em>really&lt;/em> my domain. Philosophy is weird and malleable and hard (at best) to actually put to scientific scrutiny. We can certainly measure some aspects of intelligence and communication and tool using among non-human species&amp;hellip; but how in the world to you ask an octopus what it thinks about thinking? How in the world do you tell if they&amp;rsquo;re actually aware of their self and surroundings?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The second thing Hume missed is more conspicuous. When we look inside, most people find a flow of inner speech&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, a monologue that accompanies much of our conscious life. Sentences and phrases, exclamations, rambling commentaries, speeches we would like to give, or wish we’d given. Maybe Hume did not find this in his own case? Some people have a more prominent inner monologue than others. Perhaps Hume was one of those for whom inner speech is weak? It’s possible, but I think it’s more likely that Hume did encounter inner speech, but regarded it as one part of the wash of sensations, not as anything special. There are colors and shapes and emotions in there, and echoes of speech as well.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This whole part was a bit weird&amp;ndash;which, being in the title, is kind of weird. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure what I was expecting, but somehow&amp;hellip; more?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then&amp;hellip; it ends. A lot of appendices and references meant the book ended rather before I expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A decent book with a delightful cover and a number of fun octopus facts I&amp;rsquo;d never heard before. Worth reading just for that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fireborne</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/30/fireborne/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/30/fireborne/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dragons!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;are actually probably the weakest part of the book. We&amp;rsquo;ll get back to that.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>They watch us kneel, they see the back of our heads, and they think we&amp;rsquo;ve given in. They don&amp;rsquo;t realize you can think from your knees just as well as from your feet.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What we have here is an epic fantasy world, full of the aforementioned dragons and strife and war&amp;hellip; but for a change, this world is set in the near aftermath of the collapse of the old regime and the rise of the good guys. In theory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everyone gets a chance at education. Even commoners&amp;ndash;even orphans of the revolution&amp;ndash;can apply to be trained as dragon riders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From there, we get the first half of the book&amp;ndash;a straight up magic school style training montage. It feels awfully YA, in the genre of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/12/01/the-hunger-games/">The Hunger Games&lt;/a> / &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/03/29/divergent/">Divergent&lt;/a> / &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/12/20/harry-potter/">Harry Potter&lt;/a>, up to and including a school tournament to decide the &amp;lsquo;best dragonrider&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What really makes the book shine to me is that initial setting&amp;ndash;the idea that we&amp;rsquo;re shortly after a revolution, building something new. And the entirely too real chance that the anything new&amp;hellip; might be just as bad as what came before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now&amp;hellip; the dragons. Despite the fact that all of our main characters have a dragon and they&amp;rsquo;re present throughout the series&amp;ndash;they never seem to really have any personality or presence of their own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even now, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I could honestly tell you more than the subspecies of each dragon, and even then only barely. I like intelligent dragons (a la &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/31/temeraire/">Temeraire&lt;/a>) and &lt;em>love&lt;/em> books with more &lt;em>alien&lt;/em> dragons (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/17/the-rage-of-dragons/">The Rage of Dragons&lt;/a> shines here). These are almost more like cars or fighter jets than anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s really a bummer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I enjoyed the series. And the way things go towards the latter part of the book + the ending really make me curious where in the world it&amp;rsquo;s going from here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Kingdom of Copper</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/13/the-kingdom-of-copper/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/13/the-kingdom-of-copper/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Because a lost little girl from Cairo thought she was living in some sort of fairy tale. And because for all her supposed cleverness, she couldn’t see that the dashing hero who saved her was its monster.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/07/05/the-city-of-brass/">The City of Brass&lt;/a> set us off on an adventure; The Kingdom of Copper vastly expands the world&amp;ndash;and the stakes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The city of &lt;em>Daevabad&lt;/em> is a mess. Nahri&amp;rsquo;s life is a mess. Ali&amp;rsquo;s exile is a mess. Dara is dead&amp;ndash;but what else is new?&amp;ndash;and also a mess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a book about war and violence and family squabbles writ kingdom large. We&amp;rsquo;re truly in the magical world now, and oh there&amp;rsquo;s far more depths to that world that we knew.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of all the middle books of a trilogy out there, few do quite so well as this one. It&amp;rsquo;s still got some middle book issues&amp;ndash;it doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>really&lt;/em> stand alone&amp;ndash;but for what it is, I&amp;rsquo;m quite impressed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m so looking forward to finishing this one. I fully expect even more and worse messes before (if) everything is wrapped up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“No, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t afraid. I was tired.&amp;quot; Ali&amp;rsquo;s voice broke on the word. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m tired of everyone in this city feeding on vengeance. I&amp;rsquo;m tired of teaching our children to hate and fear other children because their parents are our enemies. And I&amp;rsquo;m sick and tired of acting like the only way to save our people is to cut down all who might oppose us, as if our enemies won&amp;rsquo;t return the favor the instant power shifts.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>Bunny</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/10/bunny/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/10/bunny/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a theory&amp;hellip; it could be bunnies.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

 &lt;/div>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We never joke about bunnies, Bunny.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Man, that is quite a book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s part college experience&amp;ndash;and not just any college experience, but one at a super small liberal arts school, focusing on writing and poetry and all that&amp;hellip; to a degree that I (engineering school) couldn&amp;rsquo;t even tell you for sure if it&amp;rsquo;s satire or just &lt;em>how that works&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s part a story about loneliness and fitting in&amp;ndash;which ties in well with the college experience. About seeing the &amp;lsquo;popular girls&amp;rsquo;, first from the outside, and then all too intimately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course (not that I knew this going into it; figured it out pretty quick though), it&amp;rsquo;s part horror story. It&amp;rsquo;s a slow burning thrilling, but there&amp;rsquo;s more than a bit of the surreal and body horror bits of the genre.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All together, it&amp;rsquo;s an intense sort of read, sort of like a car crash, but in a good way. (Yeah. I know.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It takes a while to get going, slowly getting more and more&amp;hellip; off. And then everything skids hard to one side. You just can&amp;rsquo;t look away. You have to see what happens next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I enjoyed the experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Certainly not a book for everyone, but there are more than a few that I expect would get a (bunny?) kick out of it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Perdido Street Station</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/04/perdido-street-station/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/10/04/perdido-street-station/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Its substance was known to me. The crawling infinity of colours, the chaos of textures that went into each strand of that eternally complex tapestry…each one resonated under the step of the dancing mad god, vibrating and sending little echoes of bravery, or hunger, or architecture, or argument, or cabbage or murder or concrete across the aether. The weft of starlings’ motivations connected to the thick, sticky strand of a young thief’s laugh. The fibres stretched taut and glued themselves solidly to a third line, its silk made from the angles of seven flying buttresses to a cathedral roof. The plait disappeared into the enormity of possible spaces.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Any time you ask about modern &amp;lsquo;weird fiction&amp;rsquo; / weird ecologies / weird cities. China Miéville and Perdido Street Station almost always come up. Turns out&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s for a good reason. Why in the world did I take so long to read this book?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, this book really shines when it comes to weird&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> worldbuilding. Half-bird, half-human creature? Not that weird. Half-bug creatures? Where the women have a scarab beetle instead of ahead and the males are non-sapient grubs? Weird. Frog people? Re-animates and constructs? Plant people? All living together in a grimy steam-powered, airship and tech and magic driven mess of a metropolis?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Weird&lt;sup id="fnref1:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And wonderful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, this was exactly the sort of book that I love and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see there are other books in the same world, if not with the same characters. I want more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conversely, if you&amp;rsquo;re not into weird fiction, more than a touch of body horror, or a book where everyone necessarily get a happy ending (or even survive the story)&amp;hellip; maybe skip this one. It&amp;rsquo;s dark. And that&amp;rsquo;s sort of the point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: I listened to this on audiobook and I loved the narration. Perhaps my favorite thing? Whenever the narrator said Issac&amp;rsquo;s full name. Grimnebulin! &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Art is something you choose to make&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a bringing together of&amp;hellip; of everything around you into something that makes you more human, more khepri, whatever. More of a person.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>Chaos: Making a New Science</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/26/chaos-making-a-new-science/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/26/chaos-making-a-new-science/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Nature forms patterns. Some are orderly in space but disorderly in time, others orderly in time but disorderly in space. Some patterns are fractal, exhibiting structures self-similar in scale. Others give rise to steady states or oscillating ones. Pattern formation has become a branch of physics and of materials science, allowing scientists to model the aggregation of particles into clusters, the fractured spread of electrical discharges, and the growth of crystals in ice and metal alloys. The dynamics seem so basic—shapes changing in space and time—yet only now are the tools available to understand them.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Chaos is the study of non-linear systems. Of fractals. Of &amp;hellip; chaos. It takes the world we know it and proves that, at some level, we don&amp;rsquo;t know anything. We can simulate the world to ever increasing levels of accuracy and at some point, things just blow up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat idea, not nearly as weird as it was 40 years ago when this was written (and even then, three years before Jurassic Park made it really &lt;em>cool&lt;/em>). I&amp;rsquo;ve messed with &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/programming/topics/fractals/">fractals&lt;/a> more than a bit and studied quite a bit of higher level math in school, so little of this is particularly new to me&amp;ndash;so I&amp;rsquo;m probably ont the target audience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, this book is really more about the history and discovery of chaos, rather than necessarily digging into the math and how it really works (when we even know). It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, but not what I was expecting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m glad enough that I read it, but probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t strongly recommended it. So it goes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>It's A Wonderful Midlife Crisis</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/23/its-a-wonderful-midlife-crisis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/23/its-a-wonderful-midlife-crisis/</guid><description>&lt;p>As someone quickly approaching 40 with a penchant for urban fantasy, this book should have been right up my alley. Except&amp;hellip; the plot is weak, the world building is lazy, and the romance doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>really&lt;/em> make sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the book sums itself up well.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Oh God, Daisy,” ***** said, letting her head fall to her chest. “You have it all wrong.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Have what wrong?” I asked as a feeling of dread washed over me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Every good story has a major plot twist,” she said slowly, growing more agitated with each word.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is on page &lt;em>155&lt;/em> of 164. Daisy (our MC) is finally &lt;em>finally&lt;/em> learning&amp;hellip; and still got it wrong. And it&amp;rsquo;s not even (in my opinion) that sensible a plot twist. And then the book ends. It&amp;rsquo;s very much set up for a sequel; without which, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really stand alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; despite this being an oddly well reviewed book in general, it&amp;rsquo;s just really &lt;em>not&lt;/em> my cup of tea. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;d like it more. Perhaps it gets better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Happy Birthday, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/happy-birthday-mrs.-piggle-wiggle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/happy-birthday-mrs.-piggle-wiggle/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it ends&amp;hellip; 50 years later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is an interesting one. Apparently, it was largely written by the original author&amp;rsquo;s daughter with the first story an unpublished original and the rest based on &amp;rsquo;notes among her mother&amp;rsquo;s possessions&amp;rsquo;. For the most part, it fits. And ending it all with a party celebrating the titular Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/hello-mrs.-piggle-wiggle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 00:00:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/hello-mrs.-piggle-wiggle/</guid><description>&lt;p>Somehow, Mrs. Piggle-Returned. And the complete lack of any mention of her farm is just about as weird as when Star Wars did it.

&lt;p>See &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/mrs.-piggle-wiggle/">Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle&lt;/a> for my thoughts for the series as a whole.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Farm</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/mrs.-piggle-wiggles-farm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 00:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/mrs.-piggle-wiggles-farm/</guid><description>&lt;p>My thoughts for the series as a whole are on the review for &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/mrs.-piggle-wiggle/">Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For &amp;hellip; reasons, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle has moved out of town to a farm. Here, she takes the problem children and uses (farm style) household chores in order to help them be better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It actually really works&amp;ndash;and is so much less likely than [[Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle&amp;rsquo;s Magic]]. I think this might actually be my favorite. It&amp;rsquo;s weird, writing this out, to realize how relatively few stories this one had though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/mrs.-piggle-wiggles-magic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 00:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/mrs.-piggle-wiggles-magic/</guid><description>&lt;p>My thoughts for the series as a whole are on the review for &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/mrs.-piggle-wiggle/">Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle&lt;/a>. Really, if I&amp;rsquo;d only read that book and this one, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I would have continued the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the first, we have fairly mundane and reasonable solutions to realistic childhood issues. In this one&amp;ndash;straight out magic. I&amp;rsquo;m not a huge fan, especially with the tonal shift. But I do really like &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/mrs.-piggle-wiggles-farm/">Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle’s Farm&lt;/a> and (perhaps surprisingly) &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/happy-birthday-mrs.-piggle-wiggle/">Happy Birthday, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle&lt;/a>, so I&amp;rsquo;m glad I continued.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, this one does have some fun moments (the Tattletales, Lester the pig with his table manners), so it&amp;rsquo;s not all bad!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/mrs.-piggle-wiggle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 00:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/18/mrs.-piggle-wiggle/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle books are an interesting sort of children&amp;rsquo;s tales. Throughout the books, we&amp;rsquo;re introduced to familys with strange names, where always and without fail, the children are in some way, shape, or form misbehaving. One thing leads to another, their mother&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> is at her wit&amp;rsquo;s end, and&amp;hellip; they call Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle and she saves the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Originally published 1947-1957, the first four books are very much a product of their times. The family dynamics, the problems the children have, and even some of the (less magical) solutions. Yet a lot of the problems ring true, even today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to the 4 of the 5 books we&amp;rsquo;ve found audiobooks for in a somewhat random order. Mostly, the order doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Each story is fairly self contained&amp;ndash;with the exception of book 3: Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle&amp;rsquo;s farm, in which she&amp;rsquo;s moved out of town. Except in book 4, she&amp;rsquo;s back and no mention is made ever again. Anyways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last, published in book 5, actually fits fairly well with the first 4, despite the fact that it was published 50 years later by MacDonald&amp;rsquo;s daughter. Honestly, on just listening to them, it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel all that different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the main decider on if I&amp;rsquo;d like a particular story or not depended entirely on how magical the solution was. While they&amp;rsquo;re all somewhat unbelievable (a day or two staying up late curing a TV addiction? sure), I like the ones with a practical solution. In particular, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle (1), her Farm (3), and Happy Birthday (5) are my favorites. Conversely, her Magic (2) and Hello (4) are much more about magical pills and tonics that miraculously solve problems&amp;ndash;not particularly applicable that, even if they are fun to read about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, they&amp;rsquo;re a lot of fun to read/listen to and I don&amp;rsquo;t expect they&amp;rsquo;ll go away any time soon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Ballad of Black Tom</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/15/the-ballad-of-black-tom/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/15/the-ballad-of-black-tom/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Walking through Harlem first thing in the morning was like being a single drop of blood inside an enormous body that was waking up. Brick and mortar, elevated train tracks, and miles of underground pipe, this city lived; day and night it thrived.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>At first, it&amp;rsquo;s a story about a black man in the boroughs of New York in the 1920s. A gritty world, but somehow &lt;em>alive&lt;/em>, dripping with some wonderfully written descriptions of the people and places of the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Sleeping King is dead but dreaming.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Things take a somewhat supernatural turn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is another of those cases where I put a book on my &amp;rsquo;to read&amp;rsquo; list because it looked interesting and, before getting around to it, completely forgot it was going to be about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the end&amp;hellip; that took a much &lt;em>darker&lt;/em> track than I was expecting&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&amp;hellip; and that&amp;rsquo;s starting from the point of view of racial disparity and violence in the 1920s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then&amp;hellip; things get even darker. But I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that for you to read.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Nobody ever thinks of himself as a villain, does he? Even monsters hold high opinions of themselves.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s short. ~150 pages or a few hours audio. But I think it does a good job of hitting hard without overstaying it&amp;rsquo;s welcome. If you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of cosmic horror / weird fiction, I think you&amp;rsquo;ll like it. I certainly did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Islands of the Blessed</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/11/the-islands-of-the-blessed/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/11/the-islands-of-the-blessed/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here we go again, dealing once again with bad decisions made long ago coming back to bite those who made them&amp;hellip; and anyone else that might be standing nearby.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course it&amp;rsquo;s up to Jack and Thorgil to go on ANOTHER QUEST. And once again, save the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d guess that you have some purpose to fulfill and that is why you were saved. But don&amp;rsquo;t get a swelled head over it. A cabbage has a purpose when someone needs to make soup.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We get all sorts of interesting new beasties, friends, and enemies (sometimes all three). Chief among them are the Mermen and Mermaids, but also more half-trolls and even (perhaps) a god along the way, which was a take I&amp;rsquo;ve seen before, but interesting to see here.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Gods, if they&amp;rsquo;re neglected, tend to fall asleep, but they never really go away.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The cultural classes and worldbuilding, being based on our own (messy) world and history are interesting gone truly magical are still interesting and (so far as I know anyways) well researched. A joy to read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like seeing more of what happens to our characters, even if the ending is a bit bittersweet.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I remembered what Olaf always said: You must never give up, even if you&amp;rsquo;re falling off a cliff. You never know what might happen on the way down.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Overall, I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s stronger than the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/08/the-land-of-the-silver-apples/">second&lt;/a>, but not quite up to the level of the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/01/the-sea-of-trolls/">first&lt;/a> in the series. Overall, I enjoyed the series and hope to share it with my children, perhaps in a few years.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This book contains thirty stories about the children and teachers at Wayside School. But before we get to them, there is something you ought to know so that you don’t get confused.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wayside School was accidentally built sideways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was supposed to be only one story high, with thirty classrooms all in a row.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead it is thirty stories high, with one classroom on each story.

&lt;p>“You&amp;rsquo;d better tell me about that lie, Giles,&amp;quot; said the old man, massaging his forehead. &amp;ldquo;From all the sin you keep going on about, I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s going to be spectacular.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well&amp;hellip; when you put it that way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A year has passed. Jack learns family secrets and has to go on ANOTHER QUEST. I&amp;rsquo;m actually curious to see if the backstory we get here was planned all along or developed from clues in the first book only when a second was need. It really could go either way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time, we see elves (meh) and hobgoblins (lots of fun). Along the way, we end up with another new main character: Pega. Former slave, freed by Jack, and fond of commenting on &amp;lsquo;how it all could be worse&amp;rsquo;. She&amp;rsquo;s fine&amp;hellip; but not as interesting as Thorgil, personally. (We get both though!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s another adventure through the magical land of alt ~800 AD British Isles. Weaker than the first, but still absolutely solid enough that I enjoyed reading it. Onward to the thrilling (I hope!) conclusion in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/11/the-islands-of-the-blessed/">The Islands of the Blessed&lt;/a>!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Sea of Trolls</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/01/the-sea-of-trolls/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/09/01/the-sea-of-trolls/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a surprisingly fun book!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The year is A.D. 793; Jack and his sister have been kidnapped by Vikings and taken to the court of Ivar the Boneless and his terrifying half-troll wife; but things get even worse when Jack finds himself on a dangerous quest to find the magical Mimir&amp;rsquo;s Well in a far-off land, with his sister&amp;rsquo;s life forfeit if he fails.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I started out reading this since it&amp;rsquo;s a great (and rare) fit for the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/31/2024-book-bingo/">2024 Book Bingo&lt;/a> &amp;lsquo;Bard&amp;rsquo; square, since both Jack and his mentor are explicitly called &amp;lsquo;Bards&amp;rsquo; (even if, interestingly music is a relatively small part of their training), but it ends up being so much more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s got Vikings&amp;ndash;including digging into what makes them who they are and how they think differently from the people Jack grew up with.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Just say no to pillaging.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s got monsters&amp;ndash;the Vikings for one, along with Trolls (sometimes more human that anyone), dragons, ravens, and giant spiders.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Norns keep the tree Yggdrassil alive. Without them, nothing would exist… They show up when you&amp;rsquo;re born and decide what kind of life you&amp;rsquo;re going to have.&amp;quot;&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;I guess they were in a rotten mood when I came along,&amp;rdquo; Jack said. He loaded up the water bag and supplies.&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;Me too,&amp;rdquo; Thorgil said gravely.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Look around you&amp;hellip;Feel the wind, smell the air. Listen to the birds and watch the sky. Tell me what&amp;rsquo;s happening in the wide world.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s got magic. Bardic magic. Shapeshifting. Talking to animals. Calling up / banishing storms. Norse mythology. Norns. Yggdrasil.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“It&amp;rsquo;s my fault,&amp;quot; said Rune. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s untrained and likely to overdo things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;Like turning the queen bald. That was a good trick, though.&amp;rdquo; Olaf smiled.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve absolutely no idea if it&amp;rsquo;s particularly historically accurate (barring the above of course :)), but it&amp;rsquo;s a fun read and I greatly enjoyed it. Now I really want to know what happens next!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: Great fun for an audiobook, lightly accented. Just enough to get into the feel of the book all the more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second side note: I totally caught the &lt;span class="spoiler">Jack and Jill&lt;/span>
 reference from when we first learned her birth name. But man. Them just outright using that as an in universe poem was fun.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Night Masquerade</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/24/the-night-masquerade/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/24/the-night-masquerade/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Night Masquerade really continues the story of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/22/home/">Home&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>Change was constant. Change was my destiny. Growth.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>After all the events of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/24/binti/">the first story&lt;/a>, Binti&amp;rsquo;s finally at Uni, learning about the magical sort of math that&amp;rsquo;s mostly been hinted at up until then&amp;ndash;and dealing with more than a touch of PTSD. So of course she decides to return home to her people for a pilgrimage&amp;ndash;and Okwu the Meduse will come along.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Nothing was asked of Okwu and Okwu was pleased, preferring to menacingly loom in the background behind me. Okwu was happiest around human beings when it was menacingly looming.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Binti</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/20/binti/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/20/binti/</guid><description>&lt;p>I quite enjoy this book. It&amp;rsquo;s got some fascinating worldbuilding, interesting characters. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit hampered by being a novella&amp;ndash;there are a few threads that I really could have used more of. Well worth the read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One warning: the story takes a turn towards the more &amp;lsquo;horror&amp;rsquo; (or at least thriller) side of sci-fi part of the way through. I was not expecting that&amp;ndash;I enjoy that sort of thing, but be warned if that&amp;rsquo;s not your sort of story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/17/jonathan-strange-mr-norrell/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/17/jonathan-strange-mr-norrell/</guid><description>&lt;p>That one has been on my list for years now.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Can a magician kill a man by magic?” Lord Wellington asked Strange.&lt;br>
Strange frowned. He seemed to dislike the question. “I suppose a magician might,” he admitted, “but a gentleman never could.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now, having read it&amp;hellip; I &lt;em>think&lt;/em> that I enjoyed it?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Providence</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/16/providence/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/16/providence/</guid><description>&lt;p>That is quite a ride.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At it&amp;rsquo;s core, it&amp;rsquo;s a fairly standard military sci story: the aliens attacked and now we&amp;rsquo;re going out to get them back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then you peel back a layer and you have the development of AI&amp;ndash;all the more relevant with the recent developments in LLMs. Now, you don&amp;rsquo;t even &lt;em>need&lt;/em> humanity to fight the war. But true to form, if you don&amp;rsquo;t need people to fight, it&amp;rsquo;s all the harder to convince those back home to care.

(And did you know my son randomly chose #14 to start at?)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;re basically those vibrant kids&amp;rsquo; science books, writ large. Still with plenty of illustrations, scientific asides, and more child endangerment than you can shake a lightning bolt at.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around (as one might expect &amp;#x1f604;), the Friz and class end up getting swept up into a lightning storm, shrink down to the size of electrons, and &lt;em>become lightning&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a quick read, a fun adventure, and I have no problems with the science presented. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to find a few more of these to read with my son!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Journey to the Center of the Earth</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/11/journey-to-the-center-of-the-earth/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/11/journey-to-the-center-of-the-earth/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We are of opinion that instead of letting books grow moldy behind an iron grating, far from the vulgar gaze, it is better to let them wear out by being read.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This year &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/31/2024-book-bingo/">book bingo&lt;/a> has a &amp;lsquo;Underground&amp;rsquo; category&amp;ndash;and I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to actually go back and read more Verne. Seemed like a great chance to check out Journey to the Center of the Earth!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s a quintessential Jules Verne adventure. A student and professor find an old manuscript purporting to describe a path to the very center of the Earth&amp;hellip; and off they go to Snæfellsjökull (Icelandic is such a lovely language) and down into the Earth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From that, it&amp;rsquo;s one adventure after another. Down caves, running out of food and water, nearly dying&amp;ndash;and all manner of completely scientifically improbable findings along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Science, my boy, is made up of mistakes, but they are mistakes which it is useful to make, because they lead little by little to the truth.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I think the biggest difficulty in this book is probably entirely tied up with the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s 160 years old. It&amp;rsquo;s just written in a very different style. People just &amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t talk like that. But it does make it feel amusingly old-timey, which I actually like. (I wonder how much of that is the translation?)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read. Going to have to read a few more of these!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gods of Jade and Shadow</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/04/gods-of-jade-and-shadow/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/08/04/gods-of-jade-and-shadow/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>Or Mutagen I suppose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bent on eradicating genetic diseases… somewhat directly. With the power to adapt quickly to any threat. Interesting enough villain!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus we get an issue or two each with SIEGE (Iron Man as a cop?) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanatos">Thanatos&lt;/a> (certainly seems to believe himself to be anyways).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s a lot of chaos in this volume, but it’s enjoyable. I&amp;rsquo;m not a &lt;em>huge&lt;/em> fan of the older style&amp;hellip; and this has decades over the very beginning of comics. We&amp;rsquo;ll see where we go next. But for now, more Spider-Man!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of the first things he’d noticed about Mercy was that she understood people. She really knew how to get under their skin. Under his skin.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s time for my every year or two re-read of the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/07/24/mercy-thompson/">Mercy Thompson&lt;/a> books, especially with a new one out! That&amp;rsquo;s getting longer and longer each year, and I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em>here&lt;/em> for it. I think these two series (including &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/13/alpha-omega/">Alpha &amp;amp; Omega&lt;/a>) are now my favorite Urban Fantasy series, beating out even the Dresden Files (although it is close).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, specifically for this book&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man, we&amp;rsquo;ve come some ways. The last few books have gone thoroughly into &amp;lsquo;woo woo&amp;rsquo; territory (as Mercy increasingly calls it), with Mercy learning and gaining all sorts of new and interesting powers over the dead (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/31/storm-cursed/">Storm Cursed&lt;/a>), learning more than she&amp;rsquo;d likely ever wanted about Wulfe (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/03/smoke-bitten/">Smoke Bitten&lt;/a>), and even &lt;em>more&lt;/em> powers and Fae artifacts (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/05/soul-taken/">Soul Taken&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>With Mercy, everything that can be worse is. Always.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Things have gotten so &lt;em>big&lt;/em>, so it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have what actually turns out to be a relatively self contained book in Winter Lost. For the most part, we have almost a closed house murder mystery. Just Mercy, Adam, and a handful of other wild and strange folk stuck at a lodge in a winter storm.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>She was staring at him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I could not live with losing you,” he told her, his throat tight. “There are times when I have had to let you go out into danger without me. More times when I haven’t known about threats to your life until they were long past. But this time… this time I have the privilege of being backup while you head out to see if we can rescue your brother.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I love the focus this brings the book. And it really does give the two a chance, I hope, to love and trust each other. Adam has got some severe baggage from those witches &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/05/31/storm-cursed/">a few books back&lt;/a> (plus all his other baggage I suppose) and Mercy has some serious wounds to deal with. This gives them that time. With a wild story that at once feels huge and world ending&amp;ndash;and at the same time snug.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We do also get a few fun peeks into what else is going on on the Mercyverse, primarily through flashbacks and asides told from a bunch of other points of view, which makes this structurally more interesting than any of the other books thus far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to what comes next! (Although I&amp;rsquo;m personally hoping for an &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/13/alpha-omega/">Alpha &amp;amp; Omega&lt;/a> book next! What the cliffhanger).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Turning Darkness Into Light</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/07/06/turning-darkness-into-light/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/07/06/turning-darkness-into-light/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Maybe you’re right about the past. But the stories we choose to tell—those matter. It’s important that the Anevrai told a story about harmony, that they went to the effort of writing it on finely made tablets with gold at their heart. Sacred tablets. That says it was an ideal. And even when we fall short of ideals, that doesn’t mean we should give up striving for them.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so, an extra book! We&amp;rsquo;ve finished the main series that follows the eponymous Lady Trent, so now we get a book from the point of view of her granddaughter. On top of that, we&amp;rsquo;re going full on epistolary format&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s told through diary entries, letters, and the text of in universe books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting style and I think it gives a lot to the book. It&amp;rsquo;s also non-linear, but not egregiously so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I think it&amp;rsquo;s weaker than the first five Lady Trent books, but there&amp;rsquo;s a bit more depth to the Draconean history we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get to in those books, which I appreciated. If that&amp;rsquo;s something you were left wanting more of, go for it!&lt;/p>

Street living, mixed with all manner of quasi magical cons (palm readings, faking healings). And then &amp;hellip; one accidental summoning later and you&amp;rsquo;re off swept into the magical world of childhood stories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The world building is really interesting. You get a touch of the Arabic world mixed with a straight up Arabic inspired fantasy world full of djinn in all manner of shapes and sizes&amp;hellip; even at the end of the story, I&amp;rsquo;m not actually 100% sure what all the differences are.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I ever quite got around to liking Nahri. I was rooting for her before she took off, but I&amp;rsquo;m not thrilled where she ended up.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“You&amp;rsquo;re some kind of thief, then?&amp;quot;&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;That a very narrow-minded way of looking at it. I prefer to think of myself as a merchant of delicate tasks.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Ali and Dara though, I quite like the both of them&amp;ndash;surprisingly for roughly the same reasons. They are trying to do the &amp;lsquo;right thing&amp;rsquo;, just with rather opposing ways of going about that.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“To keep walking a path between loyalty to your family and loyalty to what you know is right. One of these days, you’re going to have to make a choice.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Overall, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the second book. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Man 2099 Classic, Vol. 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/07/02/spider-man-2099-classic-vol.-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/07/02/spider-man-2099-classic-vol.-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Spider-Man!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A future with no super heroes. Only the memory of those like Thor…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/spider-man-2099-v1-textbundle-88b003.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a sort of religion? It’s an interesting bit of world building. I fully expect Spiderlings before the end of this volume… (so close!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And an origin story. A new Spider-Man—Miguel O’Hara. Created in a lab “accident” after trying to quit a twisted bio engineering project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/spider-man-2099-v1-textbundle-6bc6e9.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He said the line!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Baddies? We have a forgettable cyborg. And one… somewhat less forgettable. A samurai, possibly from … Stark-Fujikawa? A mysterious shadowy—very large—boss in the shadows. The Vulture. Downtown Freakers. Hints at even more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s quite an origin story. I’m enjoying jumping into another new world so far!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Things in the Basement</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/06/15/things-in-the-basement/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/06/15/things-in-the-basement/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another children&amp;rsquo;s graphic novel in the vein of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/28/mighty-jack/">Mighty Jack&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/02/22/little-robot/">Little Robot&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>Who knows?!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man it&amp;rsquo;s a fun book and beautifully drawn.&lt;/p>
