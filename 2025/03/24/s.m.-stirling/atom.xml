&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty much the entire basis of the setting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From there, you get a book ranging from &amp;lsquo;how do we survive&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;we can&amp;rsquo;t change anything?!&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;how do we stop one of our own from building his own empire and taking over the world&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As one does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The historical basis is pretty interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s not a period I know &lt;em>terribly&lt;/em> much about&amp;ndash;although to be fair, there are a few cultures here that had to be invented mostly whole cloth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like the builders of Stonehenge&amp;ndash;they never wrote anything, so we have only scant records of what they might have been like&amp;ndash;or the writers of Linear A and B (the former only deciphered in the 50s and the latter having not done yet).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But then you have fascinating bits&amp;ndash;like you can&amp;rsquo;t very well trade with the local Native Americans for corn&amp;ndash;it won&amp;rsquo;t spread to this part of the world for thousands of years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The linguistics alone&amp;ndash;learning to speak various languages to various people was particularly interesting to me. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot to go from the idea that modern Lithuanian may be the closest to proto-Indo-European to being able to speak it, but for the sake of the story, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The survival aspects are a combination of &amp;lsquo;go humanity&amp;rsquo; and a bit much at times. The idea that they just so happen to have all the experts they could possibly need&amp;ndash;ancient fishing and farming, blacksmithing, metalurgy, chemistry. Nantucket is not &lt;em>that&lt;/em> big. And lucky they just so happened to bring back the Coast Guard&amp;rsquo;s one large sailing ship with them. But again, it&amp;rsquo;s a story. Everyone trying and then&amp;hellip; just dying out wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be nearly as interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One interesting aspect of the story was that we &lt;em>never&lt;/em> really learn (at least in this first book) &lt;em>why&lt;/em> or &lt;em>how&lt;/em> the island was sent back in time. Are they actually in their own past? Or in some alternate reality? But &amp;hellip; does it really matter? Again, it&amp;rsquo;s a story. The survival and exploring the world as it was is the point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I actually kind of like that we don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>need&lt;/em> to know why any of this happened. Just enjoy the ride. I would like to see how things change over a much longer time period&amp;ndash;but I imagine that&amp;rsquo;s a much harder bit of research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall an interesting book. Quite long. I&amp;rsquo;ll prob ably read the sequels at some point but not at the moment. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
