But luckily for me the fancy took em to stand once more beside the river where it plunged out of sight in the depths of the cavern, and as I did so an idea struck me. This river which hid itself underground doubtless emerged again at some distant spot.</p></blockquote><h3 id=seventh-and-final-voyage>Seventh and final voyage</h3><p>The caliph says go on a journey&mldr; so of course sold one more into slavery.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Well, my friend, and what do you think now?

At last he clasped his hands in prayer, and in so doing rubbed the ring, which the magician had forgotten to take from him. Immediately an enormous and frightful genie rose out of the earth, saying: “What wouldst thou with me? I am the Slave of the Ring, and will obey thee in all things.”</p></blockquote><p>There were <em>two</em>?!</p><blockquote><p>Aladdin replied: “The Sultan, as thou knowest, has broken his promise to me, and the vizir’s son is to have the princess. My command is that to-night you bring hither the bride and bridegroom.” “Master, I obey,” said the genie. Aladdin then went to his chamber, where, sure enough at midnight the genie transported the bed containing the vizir’s son and the princess. “Take this new-married man,” he said, “and put him outside in the cold, and return at daybreak.” Whereupon the genie took the vizir’s son out of bed, leaving Aladdin with the princess. “Fear nothing,” Aladdin said to her; “you are my wife, promised to me by your unjust father, and no harm shall come to you.” The princess was too frightened to speak, and passed the most miserable night of her life, while Aladdin lay down beside her and slept soundly. At the appointed hour the genie fetched in the shivering bridegroom, laid him in his place, and transported the bed back to the palace.</p></blockquote><p>Not quite the story I&rsquo;m familiar with.</p><h3 id=the-adventures-of-haroun-al-raschid-caliph-of-bagdad>The Adventures of Haroun-al-Raschid, Caliph of Bagdad</h3><blockquote><p>Baba-Abdalla,” returned the Caliph, “your way of asking alms yesterday seemed to me so strange, that I almost commanded you then and there to cease from causing such a public scandal. But I have sent for you to inquire what was your motive in making such a curious vow. When I know the reason I shall be able to judge whether you can be permitted to continue to practise it, for I cannot help thinking that it sets a very bad example to others. Tell me therefore the whole truth, and conceal nothing.</p></blockquote><h3 id=the-story-of-the-blind-baba-abdalla>The Story of the Blind Baba-Abdalla</h3><blockquote><p>At this news I became almost beside myself with joy and greed, and I flung my arms round the neck of the dervish, exclaiming: “Good dervish, I see plainly that the riches of this world are nothing to you, therefore of what use is the knowledge of this treasure to you? Alone and on foot, you could carry away a mere handful. But tell me where it is, and I will load my eighty camels with it, and give you one of them as a token of my gratitude.”</p></blockquote><p>Always wanting more.</p><blockquote><p>But, Commander of the Faithful, there is a proverb that says, “the more one has, the more one wants.” So it was with me.</p></blockquote><p>I feel like that&rsquo;s the moral of many of these stories.</p><h3 id=the-story-of-sidi-nouman>The Story of Sidi-Nouman</h3><blockquote><p>The same thing occurred at supper, and all through the next day, whenever we ate together. It was quite clear that no woman could live upon two or three breadcrumbs and a few grains of rice, and I determined to find out how and when she got food.</p></blockquote><p>Just let enough be enough already!</p><blockquote><p>It was bright moonlight, so I easily managed to keep her in sight, till she entered a cemetery not far from the house. There I hid myself under the shadow of the wall, and crouched down cautiously; and hardly was I concealed, when I saw my wife approaching in company with a ghoul—one of those demons which, as your Highness is aware, wander about the country making their lairs in deserted buildings and springing out upon unwary travellers whose flesh they eat. If no live being goes their way, they then betake themselves to the cemeteries, and feed upon the dead bodies.</p></blockquote><p>Well that got dark quickly.</p><blockquote><p>Then sprinkling it over me she said, “If you were born dog, remain dog; but if you were born man, by virtue of this water resume your proper form.” In one moment the spell was broken. The dog’s shape vanished as if it had never been, and it was a man who stood before her.</p></blockquote><p>Magic!</p><h3 id=the-story-of-ali-cogia-merchant-of-bagdad>The Story of Ali Cogia, Merchant of Bagdad</h3><blockquote><p>Ali Cogia fetched his vase and carried it to his room at the inn, where he opened it. He thrust down his hand but could feel no money; still he was persuaded it must be there. So he got some plates and vessels from his travelling kit and emptied out the olives. To no purpose. The gold was not there. The poor man was dumb with horror, then, lifting up his hands, he exclaimed, “Can my old friend really have committed such a crime?” In great haste he went back to the house of the merchant. “My friend,” he cried, “you will be astonished to see me again, but I can find nowhere in this vase a thousand pieces of gold that I placed in the bottom under the olives. Perhaps you may have taken a loan of them for your business purposes; if that is so you are most welcome. I will only ask you to give me a receipt, and you can pay the money at your leisure.”</p></blockquote><p>See, that&rsquo;s entirely reasonable, but we all know that&rsquo;s not how it will remain.</p><blockquote><p>Going down one street, the Caliph’s attention was attracted by a noise, and looking through a door which opened into a court he perceived ten or twelve children, playing in the moonlight. He hid himself in a dark corner, and watched them. “Let us play at being the Cadi,” said the brightest and quickest of them all; “I will be the Cadi. Bring before me Ali Cogia, and the merchant who robbed him of the thousand pieces of gold.”</p></blockquote><h3 id=the-enchanted-horse>The Enchanted Horse</h3><blockquote><p>Well then,” continued the prince, “you can easily understand how the King my father, who has a passion for all curious things, was seized with a violent desire to possess this horse, and asked the Indian what sum he would take for it. “The man’s answer was absolutely absurd, as you will agree, when I tell you that it was nothing less than the hand of the princess my sister; but though all the bystanders laughed and mocked, and I was beside myself with rage, I saw to my despair that my father could not make up his mind to treat the insolent proposal as it deserved. I tried to argue with him, but in vain. He only begged me to examine the horse with a view (as I quite understood) of making me more sensible of its value.</p></blockquote><p>All about wanting things.</p><h3 id=the-story-of-two-sisters-who-were-jealous-of-their-younger-sister>The Story of Two Sisters Who Were Jealous of Their Younger Sister</h3><p>So familiar. I think I read part of this one in the Pink Fairy Book.</p><blockquote><p>He is changed into a black stone,” answered the dervish, “like all the rest who have gone on the same errand, and you will become one likewise if you are not more careful in following my directions.”</p></blockquote><p>That&rsquo;d be the one I&rsquo;m familiar with. And yet, it&rsquo;s slightly different? </p><blockquote><p>As far as I can see,” said the princess, “the first thing is not to mind the tumult of the voices that follow you till you reach the cage, and then never to look behind. As to this, I think I have enough self-control to look straight before me; but as it is quite possible that I might be frightened by the voices, as even the boldest men have been, I will stop up my ears with cotton, so that, let them make as much noise as they like, I shall hear nothing.” “Madam,” cried the dervish, “out of all the number who have asked me the way to the mountain, you are the first who has ever suggested such a means of escaping the danger!
