It&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s <em>that</em> much of an overarching plot between seasons that you have to keep up with.</p><p>And man, this is a fun bit. Another series, another Taskmaster! And another assistant!</p><p>Tom (Gleeson). And lesser Tom (Cashman) are a lot of fun together. I love that lesser Tom can never keep a straight face when teh contestants screw up. It&rsquo;s delightful.</p><p>And oh the cast was a lot of fun. Anne and Lloyd as a couple on the show together made for some great moments. Wil and Tom being old friends is a dynamic we&rsquo;ve seen before in the British version but it&rsquo;s always fun. Josh was quite a wildcard at times. And Jenny was one of the reasons I came to this version of the show&ndash;I&rsquo;ve seen her acts on YouTube before and she&rsquo;s a wonderfully weird mix and has a lot of those &lsquo;young enough to make the other contestants feel old&rsquo; moments.</p><p>Overall, another great season of Taskmaster. I&rsquo;m going to have to catch more of the Australian version! LIke season 1 &#x1f604;.</p><p>Love it.</p><p>Onward!</p><hr><p>Episode by episode:</p><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-dont-slip-on-the-chips-old-man>1. <em>Don’t Slip on the Chips Old Man</em>&lt;</a></li><li><a href=#2-a-hotly-contested-auction>2. <em>A Hotly Contested Auction</em>&lt;</a></li><li><a href=#3-answer-the-phone-gary>3. <em>Answer the Phone Gary</em>&lt;</a></li><li><a href=#4-oink-oink-b>4. <em>Oink Oink B*****s</em>&lt;</a></li><li><a href=#5-the-moment-of-divorce-is-recorded>5. <em>The Moment of Divorce is Recorded</em>&lt;</a></li><li><a href=#6-everyone-here-is-a-nerd>6. <em>Everyone Here is a Nerd</em>&lt;</a></li><li><a href=#7-youve-gotta-find-the-slop>7. <em>You’ve Gotta Find the Slop</em></a></li><li><a href=#8-dingo-dongo>8. <em>Dingo Dongo</em></a></li><li><a href=#9-killed-by-a-nerd>9. <em>Killed by a Nerd</em></a></li><li><a href=#10-fun-sexy-wrestle>10. <em>Fun Sexy Wrestle</em></a></li></ul></nav><p><img src=/embeds/books/attachments/taskmaster-au-2-74307e.png alt></p><h2 id=1-dont-slip-on-the-chips-old-man>1. <em>Don’t Slip on the Chips Old Man</em>&lt;</h2><p>Prize task: The thing that most doesn’t look like what it is called.</p><p>Sea monkeys. Squirting. Chlamydia. A priest. Short bread.</p><p>Oh this show.</p><p>Task 1: Pop the balloons while wearing a seagull helmet, catch the chips (and only the chips) in the basket.</p><blockquote><p>Jenny: While wearing your seagulls helmet… hehe.</p></blockquote><p>She’s fun.</p><blockquote><p>Lloyd: Now I know how JFK felt.
Audience: (a mix of applause and gasps)
…
Tom: Now Lloyd why did you feel like JFK?
Lloyd: Well it was the unexpected loud explosions around my head.
Tom: Well after that, he felt dead.
Lloyd: I felt dead after I looked in the basket and only had two chips.
Lloyd: I was like, there’s a conspiracy. Is there a second seagull.</p></blockquote><p>Oh my.</p><blockquote><p>Anne: AHH AHHH AHHHHH.</p></blockquote><p>Also, vouchers.</p><p>I … did not expect who actually slipped on the chips. That was <em>delightful</em>.</p><p>Task 2: Scariest scarecrow wins.</p><p>😄</p><p>They actually set them out for 4 days (I presume each). That’s a delightful task.</p><p>Josh: I went to bed that night and I started to get worried. Because my scarecrow really was like a series of perches. And I thought, oh my God, I’ve made a perfect habit for birds. And I was so worried about that, because I’m not going to win this. And then at like 2am, I thought, who doesn’t want to make a home for birds. That’s crazy thinking. That’s the kind of thinking that a property developer or like Peter Dutton would have. Of course I want to make a home for birds. That’s way better than five of your … dumb points you weren’t going to give me anyways. So, I went out there and I made a beautiful home for birds and I feel like I’ve reconnected with who I am. And that’s the greatest prize of all.</p><p>Tom: (blank face)</p><p>Lesser Tom: (trying desperately to not to laugh)</p><blockquote><p>Lesser: Tom One of them is Gen X and the other one is Jen-Y. It’s Will and Jenny.</p></blockquote><p>😃</p><blockquote><p>Jenny: It’s not my fault that birds are too stupid to understand the singularity. Josh: That is how we all interpreted it. Apart from Lloyd.<br>Lloyd: Yeah, I made a scarecrow.</p></blockquote><p>Double whammy.</p><blockquote><p>Tom: What does that mean for the scores Tom?
Lesser Tom: Well it turns out that the scores are ooooh 5. Sorry, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5.</p></blockquote><p>Task 3: Make chess cool. Coolest chess wins.</p><p>Anne. Before even reading the task. Licks the chess board. 😃</p><blockquote><p>Tom: Pretty hard to fault. Playing chess in outer space.
Jenny: Yeah and I had a lobster hat.</p></blockquote><p>She’s delightful.</p><p>Josh’s dance off was by far the best version of this task though.</p><p>He got robbed.</p><blockquote><p>Josh: So you wanted me to do a dance routine where I just went like this?
Tom: It would have been a lot more chess like.
Josh: How am I the autistic one? It’s not supposed to be literal. It’s supposed to be like an idea or like an advertisement.</p></blockquote><p>Lloyd’s chess on horseback was also delightful.</p><p>Live Task: Silent disco. 4 of the 5 have music playing in their headphones, Tom has to guess the imposter.</p><blockquote><p>Tom: I’m starting to feel like this is a task for me.</p></blockquote><h2 id=2-a-hotly-contested-auction>2. <em>A Hotly Contested Auction</em>&lt;</h2><p>Prize task: make your parents tut tut.</p><p>Didn’t really expect the title in this task. Lucy less for a debutant ball.</p><blockquote><p>You know what I always say. When life gives you lemons… turn it into the first team task of the season!</p></blockquote><p>Jenny is so yellow.</p><p>First task: Toss lemons. Meters minus liters wins.</p><blockquote><p>I’m not sure that you understood what’s going on there.</p></blockquote><p>That was some impressive fruit tossing! By one team. 😃</p><p>Second task: Do something vegetable with a root vegetable.</p><blockquote><p>Lemme just picture it. I’m watching the Olympic. Someone jumps on a board. They split in half. You know what I’d do.</p></blockquote><p>Not to be outdone…</p><p>Beetroot marriage proposal.</p><p>That is all.</p><blockquote><p>It’s just me and you in the dark staring at sweet potato.</p></blockquote><p>As one does.</p><blockquote><p>So, parsnip throwing. I feel like we’ve stumbled on another Welsh national sport.</p></blockquote><p>He asked them to turn it into a task. Everybody else did it better. That’s absolutely delightful.</p><p>Third task: Get the balls from this jar to that jar without touching them.</p><blockquote><p>You mother f**ker.</p></blockquote><p>(this jar had no bottom…)</p><p>Their faces. Delightful.</p><blockquote><p>Before this series, I thought I was really quite a competent human being.</p></blockquote><p>Oh Jenny.</p><p>That’s Taskmaster for you.</p><blockquote><p>It’s true. Is one of the best disqualifications I’ve ever seen.</p></blockquote><p>Not only that, but negative points!</p><p>Live task: Paint a thing that rhymes with your thing with your thing.</p><p>More negative points!</p><p>A spread from 21 to 5. Quite an episode.</p><h2 id=3-answer-the-phone-gary>3. <em>Answer the Phone Gary</em>&lt;</h2><p>Prize task: Most useful thing.</p><p>The wheel? The concept of fire?</p><p>No. A red onion.</p><p>After all:</p><blockquote><p>There’s water in the onion, but there’s not onion in the water.</p></blockquote><p>First task: Wear as much water as possible from the shower to the bath.</p><blockquote><p>I was going for spine logic.</p></blockquote><p>… fair enough Jenny. Fair enough.</p><blockquote><p>I’ve never tested the permeability of a parachute before.</p></blockquote><p>The fact that it started raining for Anne’s was fun.</p><blockquote><p>Thanks God.</p></blockquote><p>She still didn’t win.</p><p>Second task: Advertise for some random company.</p><p>Jenny barely having any idea what a record was… makes me feel old.</p><blockquote><p>So Lloyd are you the only Welshman that can’t sing?</p></blockquote><p>Third task: What did the person who fixed the light two minutes ago look like?</p><blockquote><p>I feel cheated by you. Him. The whole show is a lie.</p></blockquote><p>Well…</p><blockquote><p>What’s with the fish?</p></blockquote><p>😃</p><p>Going to find him? Brilliant. They missed a chance to have someone else standing out there.</p><p>(Jenny refusing to believe it was the same guy was so worth it.)</p><p>Live task: Get your team (but not the other team) to guess a word.</p><blockquote><p>It starts with a D and ends with a G.<br>…<br>D G</p></blockquote><p>Hoag having the lowest score at this point in the season along all of English speaking Taskmaster is delightful. And tells me there are Taskmasters in other languages?!</p><h2 id=4-oink-oink-b>4. <em>Oink Oink B*****s</em>&lt;</h2><p>Babushka doll magazine. That little smile.</p><p>Prize task: Make the crowd ooh. Tom is fun.</p><p>Jenny giving the audience envelopes to queue them was pretty sneaky!</p><p>First task: Go as low as you can.</p><p>I do love the contrast. First two completely ignore the limbo bar… who would just go and limbo?</p><p>Well… the next two. Obviously. Who would just crawl under it? Well.</p><blockquote><p>Jenny: Can I have the iPad back please?
Tom: No! … What if I reset it?</p></blockquote><p>And then she sends it off in a boat and starts insulting him.</p><p>She’s delightful.</p><p>Second task: Not about manta rays. About mantras. Yay.</p><blockquote><p>You know what I like to say to my friends?
No, I say “oink oink bitches”</p></blockquote><p>I continue to fail to guess which task will provoke the episode title.</p><p>Anne got … rather violent. I wonder if you’d see that in the US Taskmaster…</p><p>Third task: Do various things to balls into a van.</p><p>Anne figuring it out! (Ish) And still totally failing. Delightful.</p><p>Going into the final task with only a two point spread? Have we seen that before?!</p><p>Live task: Share a childhood task into an auto-tune microphone. Deceive Tom.</p><blockquote><p>Jenny: Can I clarify? Is the point to deceive?
Tom: (makes the most ridiculous duh face)</p></blockquote><p>Oh she’s fun.</p><blockquote><p>Well I’m just trying to think, which of the contestants used to go on holidays to to Wollongong … and knows how to do a Welsh accent.</p></blockquote><p>Poor Lloyd. 😄</p><h2 id=5-the-moment-of-divorce-is-recorded>5. <em>The Moment of Divorce is Recorded</em>&lt;</h2><p>Prize task: The thing to most improve a camping trip.</p><blockquote><p>Tom: I love camping.
…
Jenny: Like Lloyd, I had camping. I feel like only a psycopath enjoys camping.</p></blockquote><p>First task: Find Tom. He lies.</p><p>lol. That was absolutely delightful.</p><blockquote><p>I have never been so sure my phone was on silent…</p></blockquote><p>Tom getting bored was fun as well. 😄</p><blockquote><p>I’m in something that’s the right way up.</p></blockquote><p>Second task: Don’t do it.</p><blockquote><p>Lesser Jenny: How was I meant to know that?
Tom: You weren’t!
Lesser Jenny: Oh man. Why were you wearing a jacket?
Lesser Tom: I think I look cool.</p></blockquote><p>She got bored in a few minutes 😄.</p><blockquote><p>Jenny: And I feel like this is how I find out that I have ADHD.</p></blockquote><p>Not even 3 minutes.</p><blockquote><p>Tom: Lloyd I feel like you left not knowing what the task was.
Lloyd: I have been wondering for four months waht I did. I didn’t see the sign. Unlike Ace of Bass.
(to Jenny)
I’ll explain that later.</p></blockquote><p>Delightful.</p><p>Josh and Wil having a stubborn off was a delightful contrast to Jenny.</p><p>Third task: Invent and promote an original conspiracy theory.</p><blockquote><p>Jenny: You won’t believe the reason why you’re horny all the time.</p></blockquote><p>Oh my.</p><p>Lesser Tom… oh my.</p><blockquote><p>Jenny: See you next time.
Wil: Stay horny!</p></blockquote><p>Live task: Make the sound of the thing on your drum.</p><p>… Wils’ were delightful.</p><h2 id=6-everyone-here-is-a-nerd>6. <em>Everyone Here is a Nerd</em>&lt;</h2><p>Prize task: The thing you would marry if you could.</p><p>Having a couple among the contestants… that have been together (but not married) for years. 😄</p><p>And then food.</p><p>First task: Show off one of your senses. (Penalty for choosing the same as someone else)</p><blockquote><p>Josh: How many do I have to do to show it off.
(Lesser) Tom: A hundred. (raises eyebrows)</p></blockquote><p>I love watching him when the contestants are doing bonkers things.</p><p>And they’re always doing bonkers things.</p><blockquote><p>Tom: So Josh, you said you were going to do a hundred. You didn’t get to a hundred. How many did you try do you think?
Josh: As many as Tom would get to me.
Tom: Ok which was how many do you think?
Josh: I don’t know.
Tom: <em>rolls his eyes</em></p></blockquote><p>Second task: When the game of duck duck duck duck duck duck goose.</p><p>Delightful logic puzzles.</p><p>It starting to rain super hard during Josh’s task was fun.</p><blockquote><p>(Lesser Tom): I’m really regretting giving you a pen.</p></blockquote><p>After 42 minutes… she finally asked her first question.</p><p>After 1hr 26min, she finished her 5th (and final) question and … she <span class=spoiler>still didn’t get it right</span>
.</p><blockquote><p>Josh: It’s weird, because it’s so much smarter than me. But it’s so dumb.</p></blockquote><p>Third task: Fluke something.</p><blockquote><p>Lloyd: Do you have any sharp knives?</p></blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote><p>Jenny: Could we set up the duck duck goose thing again?</p></blockquote><p>That’s delightful.</p><p>(She <span class=spoiler>got it wrong</span>
again.)</p><p>Final task: Do … weird things.</p><blockquote><p>… with 423,820 Hundreds and Thousands …</p></blockquote><p>They weighed them.</p><p>Right?</p><h2 id=7-youve-gotta-find-the-slop>7. <em>You’ve Gotta Find the Slop</em></h2><p>Prize task: A thing that’s great to have one of… and worse the more you have.</p><blockquote><p>Jenny: I have brought in the Plan B pill.
…
Also also, my dad, he’s in the crowd tonight.</p></blockquote><p>Oh my.</p><p>Noses. Skulls. Booze. Buttholes.</p><blockquote><p>Josh: It’s kind of like the nose in many ways.</p></blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote><p>Tom: That’s enough cider and buttholes for one night. Let’s get on to the good stuff.</p></blockquote><p>First task: Find the minivan in the sock.</p><p>Sneaky sneaky.</p><p>Josh just ignoring Tom’s increasingly blatent hints and pulling every single sock down was the best.</p><blockquote><p>Josh: I think if I was completely wrong, you would have sort of hinted by now.</p></blockquote><p>1hr 43min.</p><p>All the socks.</p><p>Second task: Go full slop mode.</p><p>Man they’re really going into the whole ‘just don’t tell the contestants anything and see what happens’ this season.</p><p>Third task: Make yourself look extremely strong or extremely weak.</p><blockquote><p>Tom: I’m still reflecting on you calling the ancient olympic games the OG olympics.
Lesser Tom: Old and Greek.
Tom: … fair enough.</p></blockquote><p>Wil pulling the car… and the ropes obviously slack behind him was fun.</p><p>Anne… is a horse. That is all.</p><p>Prize task: With your time, perform a task to represent the shown time.</p><p>The first guess being two minutes off was pretty awesome. I’m actually really impressed in general at those.</p><h2 id=8-dingo-dongo>8. <em>Dingo Dongo</em></h2><p>Prize task: An object that has really seen some shit.</p><p>Anne and Lloyd sharing a brain. 😄</p><p>Wil just <em>absolutely</em> elevating the idea of bringing toilet paper was amazing.</p><p>Tom did not agree sadly.</p><p>First task: Break the eggs from the furthest distance.</p><blockquote><p>Lloyd: And now I realize that I do not agree with me.</p></blockquote><p>32cm. Not bad.</p><p>Second task: With your team identify as many objects as you can through the mattress.</p><blockquote><p>Anne: I’m not that way inclined
Josh: What way inclined.
Anne: I mean—useful to the world.</p></blockquote><p>It ended up much better!</p><p>Third task: Show a different side of yourself.</p><blockquote><p>Lesser Tom: If you didn’t get me with butt—you’re going to have a hard time winning me over with balls.</p></blockquote><p>It ended up so wholesome.</p><p>Prize task: Bubble Quiddich.</p><p>That was hilarious.</p><p>Especially the defense.</p><h2 id=9-killed-by-a-nerd>9. <em>Killed by a Nerd</em></h2><p>Prize task: An object that should be a movie.</p><p>Duck. Jesus table. Nokia. Barbie<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. Eczema.</p><p>Oh this show.</p><p>First task: Make this balloon hover the longest.</p><blockquote><p>Lloyd: That could have went better.
Josh: I need to learn to believe in myself.
