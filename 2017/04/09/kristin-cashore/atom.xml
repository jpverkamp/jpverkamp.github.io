In Fire, he showed up, even if it felt really weird and not really core to the story. Here&amp;hellip; we actually start to get just how twisted he really was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bitterblue takes place roughly a decade after Graceling (and around 50 years after Fire), following the story of now ~20 year old Queen Bitterblue as she tries to untangle the absolute mess her father had made of the kingdom. Add into that a bit of a princess exploring her kingdom as a commoner trope, a bit of a romance subplot, and a sprinkling of&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fire</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/03/22/fire/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/03/22/fire/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fire is something of a bizarre &amp;lsquo;sequel&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s actually set chronologically before Graceling. For the most part, it&amp;rsquo;s set in a different part of the world, separated from the previously known seven kingdoms by an (almost) impassible mountain range. And with one exception&amp;ndash;that honestly doesn&amp;rsquo;t make that much sense&amp;ndash;there are no characters shared between the two books. Honestly, this joins the list of books that would have been much better had they not been marketed as a sequel or even being explicitly in the same world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some odd choices in the book that I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Graceling</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/03/04/graceling/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/03/04/graceling/</guid><description>&lt;p>I enjoyed Graceling more than I actually expected to. It starts out slowly and ends a bit abruptly, but there was something about it that kept me going right to the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, the story starts with main character Katsa kicking ass as a sort of enforcer for the King. She&amp;rsquo;s not thrilled with the idea, but what choice does she have? Halfway through the story, she meets Po and ends up running off to what feels like a completely different plotline (although to be fair, they are tangentially related by way of Po&amp;rsquo;s grandfather. They end up on the run from Mad King Bad Guy, cross some mountains&amp;hellip; and then the story sort of ends. It&amp;rsquo;s not a terrible story, but I felt like it was a bit light at times and tended to drop things without warning.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
