Yahoo worked exactly as I expected, when I clicked on the link for the first time, it would take me to the Yahoo login page and then to a page to grant the proper permissions. All well and good. The same with Google.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adventures in OpenID land</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/07/19/adventures-in-openid-land/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jul 2012 04:59:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/07/19/adventures-in-openid-land/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I started working on a little webapp. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly to get me back in practice writing website code, but it does hopefully have the side effect of being useful. More on that later though, perhaps when it&amp;rsquo;s actually working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, the first thing that I wanted to do for this app was to set up some sort of authentication system. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t have HTTPS set up at the moment with my webhost (&lt;a title="Dreamhost Homepage" href="http://dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost&lt;/a>; they really are pretty good to work with and far better than my previous host) and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make as much sense to send passwords in plaintext over the network, I decided to go ahead and give OpenID a try. Granted, it&amp;rsquo;s still sending the authentication information in plaintext for at least part of the trip, but it&amp;rsquo;s still something that I think is worth learning.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
