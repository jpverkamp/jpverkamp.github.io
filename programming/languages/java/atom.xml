Three days to a feature complete game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I ended cutting one of the kinds of levels, but other than that I got everything that I wanted in the game. It&amp;rsquo;s got 10 different kinds of pieces, 8 different kinds of levels (most procedurally generated), and statistics galore. It actually turned out to be kind of fun, although it&amp;rsquo;s a bit slower than I&amp;rsquo;d like. Not much I can do about that though without implementing a mouse interface (which I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do some day).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#1GAM - ChessLike 0.2.0 - Dungeons!</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/31/#1gam-chesslike-0.2.0-dungeons/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2013 15:00:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/31/#1gam-chesslike-0.2.0-dungeons/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s another day&amp;rsquo;s work on ChessLike.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Since both the image and turtle libraries need the same color code, I&amp;rsquo;ve factored that out into it&amp;rsquo;s own module: &lt;code>[(c211 color)](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-pub/c211/wombat/docs/c211-color.htm &amp;quot;C211 Color API&amp;quot;)&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/wombat-ide/issues/detail?id=193" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Issue 193&lt;/a>: Opening a file on top of an empty replaces that document.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Bug fixes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fixed documentation issues with image-&amp;gt;list, list-&amp;gt;image,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/wombat-ide/issues/detail?id=187" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Issue 187&lt;/a>: Fixed the direction parameter to &lt;code>hatch&lt;/code> to take degrees rather than radians to match the rest of the library.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Made links in the about dialog clickable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/wombat-ide/issues/detail?id=186" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Issue 186&lt;/a>: Fixed the recent document manager on documents with the same name.&lt;/li>

Added a bit of code to differentiate between a normal let and a named let. Fixed for losing the syntax definitions on some systems. Also, I wrote code to generate help files for the C211 libraries. Theoretically, I should just be able to update these with future updates to the APIs:
Image API Matrix API Tree API Turtle API Color API (Edit: Added 19 May after re-factoring of colors) As a side note, I&amp;rsquo;ve added two new functions to the tree API:</description></item><item><title>Wombat IDE - Help and image bug fixes</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/04/29/wombat-ide-help-and-image-bug-fixes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Apr 2012 04:55:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/04/29/wombat-ide-help-and-image-bug-fixes/</guid><description>A new feature: any keyword can now have an associated hyperlink that points to the Chez Scheme API reference for that function. Just click on a function that you want help with and hit F1 on your keyboard. The link will open in your systems default browser.

&lt;h3 id="updated-turtle-library-with-new-names">Updated turtle library with new names&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Essentially, I&amp;rsquo;ve changed a few of the names in the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/04/13/wombat-ide-turtle-graphics/">previous turtle API&lt;/a> and added a few new alias.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>spawn&lt;/code> has been renamed to &lt;code>hatch&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>split&lt;/code> has been been renamed to &lt;code>clone&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>teleport!&lt;/code> has been added as an alias to &lt;code>move-to!&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>turn-counter-clockwise!&lt;/code> has been added as an alias to &lt;code>turn-left!&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>turn-clockwise!&lt;/code> and &lt;code>turn!&lt;/code> have been added as aliases to &lt;code>turn-right!&lt;/code>&lt;/li>

In this case, I want to add an animation feature to the turtle graphics library so I just went ahead and wrote one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These new functions have been added to the turtle API:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>(live-display b)&lt;/code> - &lt;code>b&lt;/code> should be &lt;code>#t&lt;/code> or &lt;code>#f&lt;/code> to enable or disable the live display, default is &lt;code>#f&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>(live-delay n)&lt;/code> - set the timer between frames, default is 0.1 seconds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>(live-display)&lt;/code> - is live display enabled?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>(live-delay)&lt;/code> - get the current delay&lt;/li>

Bug fixes:
Fixed a problem with the interop libraries reporting they were finished before they actually were. Now when reading a few hundred images, the call will block until they are actually read rather than just pretending to read them as it was. Issue 158: Prevent backups of backup files (no double ~). Basically, if a person directly edits a backup file, they&amp;rsquo;re on their own.</description></item><item><title>Wombat IDE - A new way</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/04/11/wombat-ide-a-new-way/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2012 04:55:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/04/11/wombat-ide-a-new-way/</guid><description>&lt;p>Up until now, the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/01/19/wombat-ide-the-first-petite-versions/">Petite bindings&lt;/a> have been built around a threaded model where one thread existed solely to send new commands to the Petite process and another solely to read responses back.

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/wombat-ide/issues/detail?id=138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Issue 138&lt;/a>: Automatically create a backup file (with a ~ suffix) on save and an option to disable it. There have been a few issues with Wombat crashing that I haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to track down, this should help people recover from those. (They&amp;rsquo;re rare; as in 2 cases reported among over 150 students for several months, so this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen to the majority of users).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The mnemonic in the recent documents menu has been tweaked to be ascending and 1 based rather than descending and 0 based.&lt;/li>

First, I have my first code contribution from someone else. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Graham during Peer Tutoring for C212 and when we were busy, we talked about Wombat.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fixed the cursor jumping to the end of the document on saves. This was being caused by the code that automatically trimmed whitespace, which will still change the file on disk but won&amp;rsquo;t change the actual open document.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Apparently, there were some lingering issues with the undo/redo stack sometimes erasing the document. If this happens, you can always undo once more to get passed it, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ve tracked down why it was happening. If it happens again, please let me know.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed an error where closing documents through the InfoNode close event wouldn&amp;rsquo;t actually remove them from memory.&lt;/li>

Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread() { public void run() { NativeProcess.destroy(); } }); (NativeProcess is the Petite Process object.)
Theoretically, this code will run whenever the Java Virtual Machine shuts down normally, so if it crashes there will still be problems (although it&amp;rsquo;s harder than you might think to get the JVM to crash unless you&amp;rsquo;re specifically trying to do so).
I just thought that was neat and should avoid some of the problems that Odete was having with zombie processes.</description></item><item><title>Wombat IDE 2.x</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/01/20/wombat-ide-2.x/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2012 05:05:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/01/20/wombat-ide-2.x/</guid><description>The new version of Wombat has been uploaded. Rather than the Java Webstart based 1.x version, the new version has a built in auto update system. All that you need is the launcher (you can get itÂ here) and everything should go from there.
You should automatically get at least version 2.20.3. From now on, the 1.x line (using Webstart and Kawa) will no longer be updated and all updates will be to the 2.</description></item><item><title>Wombat IDE - The first Petite versions</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/01/19/wombat-ide-the-first-petite-versions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2012 04:55:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/01/19/wombat-ide-the-first-petite-versions/</guid><description>&lt;p>I started the basic conversion to petite back on 13 January, but I finally managed to get everything working today. To start the conversion, the first thing that I did was split everything into three active projects:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>ide - contains the GUI code and code to whatever Scheme system I use&lt;/li>
&lt;li>launcher - contains the code to find the correct version of the IDE and launch it and also to update to the latest version(s) automatically&lt;/li>
&lt;li>petite - contains the bindings to Petite and can actually act as a stand-alone command-line REPL&lt;/li>

Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, Kawa has been great for what it was, but there are just enough things that are just slightly off that I want to make the change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Essentially, it all comes down to the fact that the autograder and other tools still run on Chez Scheme. Over the semester, there have been an increasing number of problems where the two don&amp;rsquo;t quite agree and so there has to be special cases done by hand. Optimally, I would like Wombat to have 100%Â compatibilityÂ with Chez Scheme (at least in the parts that the students use), but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that I&amp;rsquo;m going to be able to get there with what I&amp;rsquo;m doing. There&amp;rsquo;s already about 1000 lines of code to make them work better together and it&amp;rsquo;s only likely to get longer. At some point, I might as well just write my own Scheme. So here goes!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wombat IDE - C211 Matrix Library</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2011/12/13/wombat-ide-c211-matrix-library/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2011 04:55:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2011/12/13/wombat-ide-c211-matrix-library/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the final exam, I&amp;rsquo;ve added a matrix API.
