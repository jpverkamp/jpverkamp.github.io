One of the ones I particular enjoy is &lt;code>text&lt;/code>: &lt;code>data:text/html, &amp;lt;html contenteditable&amp;gt;&lt;/code>. What that does is open a new tab where I can take notes, completely locally. It&amp;rsquo;s really handy&amp;hellip; but there&amp;rsquo;s one big problem: I often accidentally close the tab and lose whatever I had been typing. So I decided to take a few minutes to write up a simple extension of the idea that would save the data to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LocalStorage">LocalStorage&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sandbox Battle!</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/08/24/sandbox-battle/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2014 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/08/24/sandbox-battle/</guid><description>&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/2014/title.png"/>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>AI players; at the very least one that moves randomly, but optimally several different kinds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pending the previous, a selector on the options screen that can turn each player either off, on, or to any of the current AIs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stylings around the page; probably some sort of thick border that bleeds a little in and out, looking different per player&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Ludum Dare 30: 24 hours</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/08/23/ludum-dare-30-24-hours/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2014 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/08/23/ludum-dare-30-24-hours/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here we are, 24 hours into the competition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of the last few hours has been spent doing a fair amount of restructing. Before, I had a single &amp;rsquo;thread&amp;rsquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> for each of the tiles, along with another thread listening for user input. Unfortunately though, that lead to all sorts of race conditions.
Specifically, whenever two tiles overlapped, it was often the case that one was doing the falling step (which copies from one internal buffer to another) while the other was in the swap step (which copies from tile to another). Then after the first finished, it would copy the second buffer over&amp;hellip; overwriting anything that had been swapped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oops.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ludum Dare 30: Hints of a game</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/08/23/ludum-dare-30-hints-of-a-game/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2014 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/08/23/ludum-dare-30-hints-of-a-game/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re getting there. 18 hours in and I have the first hints of what might actually be a game&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ludum Dare 30: Sandbox Battle</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/08/22/ludum-dare-30-sandbox-battle/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2014 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/08/22/ludum-dare-30-sandbox-battle/</guid><description>&lt;p>And here we are again. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/05/21/ludum-dare-26-vtanks-results/">Ludum Dare&lt;/a>.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ludum Dare is a regular accelerated game development Event. Participants develop games from scratch in a weekend, based on a theme suggested by community.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>More specifically, the goal is to make a game from scratch in 48 hours. You&amp;rsquo;re allowed to use publicly available frameworks and code libraries, but no art or other assets. Previously, I missed the original start time. So although I made my game in 48 hours, it didn&amp;rsquo;t qualify. This time around, I&amp;rsquo;m starting on time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Approximating Pi with Buffon's Needle</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/03/18/approximating-pi-with-buffons-needle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2013 14:00:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/03/18/approximating-pi-with-buffons-needle/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a bit late for Pi Day, but Programming Praxis had &lt;a href="http://programmingpraxis.com/2013/03/15/buffons-needle/" title="Buffon's Needle">a neat problem on Friday&lt;/a> that I wanted to check out:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Suppose we have a floor made of parallel strips of wood, each the same width, and we drop a needle onto the floor. What is the probability that the needle will lie across a line between two strips?&lt;/p>

Yahoo worked exactly as I expected, when I clicked on the link for the first time, it would take me to the Yahoo login page and then to a page to grant the proper permissions. All well and good. The same with Google.</description></item><item><title>Adventures in OpenID land</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/07/19/adventures-in-openid-land/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jul 2012 04:59:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/07/19/adventures-in-openid-land/</guid><description>Today I started working on a little webapp. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly to get me back in practice writing website code, but it does hopefully have the side effect of being useful. More on that later though, perhaps when it&amp;rsquo;s actually working.
In any case, the first thing that I wanted to do for this app was to set up some sort of authentication system. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t have HTTPS set up at the moment with my webhost (Dreamhost; they really are pretty good to work with and far better than my previous host) and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make as much sense to send passwords in plaintext over the network, I decided to go ahead and give OpenID a try.</description></item></channel></rss>
