(an example parsing huge JSON logs)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/11/go-is-faster-than-python-an-example-parsing-huge-json-logs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/11/go-is-faster-than-python-an-example-parsing-huge-json-logs/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently at work I came across a problem where I had to go through a year&amp;rsquo;s worth of logs and corelate two different fields across all of our requests. On the good side, we have the logs stored as JSON objects (archived from Datadog which collects them). On the down side&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a huge amount of data. Not as much as I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with at previous jobs/in some academic problems, but we&amp;rsquo;re still talking on the order of terabytes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, write up a quick Python script, fire and forget. It takes maybe ten minutes to write the code and (for this specific example) half an hour to run it on the specific cloud instance the logs lived on. So we&amp;rsquo;ll start with that. But then I got thinking&amp;hellip; Python is supposed to be super slow right? Can I do better?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Note: This problem is mostly disk bound. So Python actually for the most part does just fine.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A CLI Tool for Bulk Processing Github Dependabot Alerts (with GraphQL!)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/03/a-cli-tool-for-bulk-processing-github-dependabot-alerts-with-graphql/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/03/a-cli-tool-for-bulk-processing-github-dependabot-alerts-with-graphql/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dependabot is &amp;hellip; &lt;em>somewhat useful&lt;/em>. When it comes to letting you know that there are critical issues in your dependencies that can be fixed simply by upgrading the package (they did all the work for you*). The biggest problem is that it can just be &lt;em>insanely&lt;/em> noisy. In a busy repo with multiple Node.JS codebases (especially), you can get dozens to even hundreds of reports a week. And for each one, you optimally would update the code&amp;hellip; but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s just not practical. So you have to decide which updates you actually apply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So. How do we do it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well the traditional rest based Github APIs don&amp;rsquo;t expose the dependabot data, &lt;em>but&lt;/em> the newer GraphQL one does! I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, I haven&amp;rsquo;t used as much GraphQL as I probably should, it&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a bit more complicated than REST. But it does expose what I need.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A simple Flask Logging/Echo Server</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/01/a-simple-flask-logging/echo-server/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/01/a-simple-flask-logging/echo-server/</guid><description>&lt;p>A very simple server that can be used to catch all incoming HTTP requests and just echo them back + log their contents. I needed it to test what a webhook actually returned to me, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that there are a number of other things it could be dropped in for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will take in any GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE HTTP request with any path/params/data (optionally JSON), pack that data into a JSON object, and both log that to a file (with a UUID1 based name) plus return this object to the request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Warning: Off hand, there is already a potential security problem in this regarding DoS. It will happily try to log anything you throw at it, no matter how big and will store those in memory first. So long running requests / large requests / many requests will quickly eat up your RAM/disk. So&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t leave this running unattended? At least not without additional configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it! Hope it&amp;rsquo;s helpful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pulling more than 5000 logs from datadog</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/25/pulling-more-than-5000-logs-from-datadog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/25/pulling-more-than-5000-logs-from-datadog/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog&lt;/a> is pretty awesome. I wish I had it at my previous job, but better late than never. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;ve used it a lot for digging through recent logs to try to construct various events for various (security related) reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the problems I&amp;rsquo;ve come into though is that eventually you&amp;rsquo;re going to hit the limits of what datadog can do. In particular, I was trying to reconstruct user&amp;rsquo;s sessions and then check if they made one specific sequence of calls or another one. So far as I know, that isn&amp;rsquo;t directly possible, so instead, I wanted to download a subset of the datadog logs and process them locally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Easy enough, yes? Well: &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67281698/datadog-export-logs-more-than-5-000">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67281698/datadog-export-logs-more-than-5-000&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out, you just can&amp;rsquo;t export more than 5000 logs directly. &lt;em>But&lt;/em>&amp;hellip; they have an API with pagination!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 25: Cucumbinator</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/25/aoc-2021-day-25-cucumbinator/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 00:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/25/aoc-2021-day-25-cucumbinator/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="source-sea-cucumberhttpsadventofcodecom2021day25">Source: &lt;a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/25">Sea Cucumber&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">yield&lt;/span> p
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Dataclasses are great. They give you constructors and a bunch of other things for free. On top of that, if you specify &lt;code>frozen=True&lt;/code>, making them immutable, you also get &lt;code>hashable&lt;/code> types for free (which I&amp;rsquo;ll use in the problem).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps the most interesting bit here is the function that will iterate through the &lt;code>points&lt;/code> in a &lt;code>List&lt;/code>. Specifically, it will figure out the x and y delta (&lt;code>xd&lt;/code> and &lt;code>yd&lt;/code>) and repeatedly add that until you hit the end point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> this only works for lines that are vertical, horizontal, or diagonal (at 45 degrees). Anything else needs a better &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/line%20drawing%20algorithm">line drawing algorithm&lt;/a> (of which there are a few). If we need it, I&amp;rsquo;ll implement it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, use that to parse:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">def&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">parse&lt;/span>(file: TextIO) &lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span> List[Line]:
result &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> []
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">for&lt;/span> line &lt;span style="color:#f92672">in&lt;/span> file:
x1, y1, x2, y2 &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> [int(v) &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">for&lt;/span> v &lt;span style="color:#f92672">in&lt;/span> line&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>replace(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39; -&amp;gt; &amp;#39;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;&lt;/span>)&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>split(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;&lt;/span>)]
result&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>append(Line(Point(x1, y1), Point(x2, y2)))
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> result
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The input format is &lt;code>x1,y1 -&amp;gt; x2,y2&lt;/code>, but it&amp;rsquo;s easier to split and convert if we do it all directly. There are a few other ways we could have done this: splitting on anything non-numeric or using a regular expression / something else for parsing directly. But I think this is clear enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And with all that, the problem is actually pretty short:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">def&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">part1&lt;/span>(file: typer&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>FileText):

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">continue&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">for&lt;/span> point &lt;span style="color:#f92672">in&lt;/span> line&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>points():
counter[point] &lt;span style="color:#f92672">+=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>
print(sum(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> count &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;gt;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">else&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">for&lt;/span> point, count &lt;span style="color:#f92672">in&lt;/span> counter&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>items()))
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll use the built in &lt;code>collections.Counter&lt;/code> datatype, since that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we&amp;rsquo;re doing: counting things. Then just iterate over every line, skip the non-orthagonal ones, iterate over every point, and count them up. At the end, print the number that we saw more than once. Et voila.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s generate a cellular automata where each pixel updates based on a neural network given as input:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The x/y coordinates (scaled to the range 0-1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An optional random value (to make it more dynamic)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A variety of neighboring data, such as:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The number of neighbors that are &amp;lsquo;active&amp;rsquo; (&amp;gt; 50% white), ranges 0-8 scaled to 0-1. This should allow &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s%20Game%20of%20Life">Conway&amp;#39;s Game of Life&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The RGB values of all neighbors (allows a superset of the above)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gradients, subtract color value of the left from the right so that you get edges and side to side movement&lt;/li>

The main gotchas are that you have gravity to content with&amp;ndash;your snake will easily fall off the edge of the world&amp;ndash;and each time you eat a fruit, your snake gets bigger. This can help get longer to get into hard to reach places or it can cause trouble when you trap yourself in corners.&lt;/p>

It got &amp;hellip; complicate. Mostly, because every time I wrote a &lt;code>step&lt;/code> function, I had to be careful to undo the same.

&lt;p>I play a lot of board games. With the whole COVID-19 mess, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a lot on &lt;a href="https://boardgamearena.com/">Board Game Arena&lt;/a>, which is a wonderful site. But one thing that&amp;rsquo;s a bit lacking is having ratings / metadata about games to great games I&amp;rsquo;ve just not heard about before. Where can you get lots of that data? &lt;a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/">Board Game Geek&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem though, is merging the two. So, how do we do it? Well, this time around, I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with &lt;a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/252354/list-games-board-game-arena">this GeekList&lt;/a> that someone else maintains of BGA games on BGG. Which has the games, but no ranks. And apparently there are no ways to rank those by BGG (for some reason). But that&amp;rsquo;s easy when you know a bit of scripting!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Generating a Book Bingo Chart in Hugo</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/26/generating-a-book-bingo-chart-in-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/26/generating-a-book-bingo-chart-in-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/01/2021-book-bingo/">r/Fantasy 2021 Book Bingo&lt;/a> post!

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Given a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linked%20list">linked list&lt;/a> and an element &lt;code>x&lt;/code>. Partition the list so that all elements less than &lt;code>x&lt;/code> are before elements greater than or equal to &lt;code>x&lt;/code>, but do not otherwise change the order of the elements.&lt;/p>

Given an MxN matrix of numbers, find the longest path of strictly increasing numbers.
So for example in this matrix:
994 668 211 You can start with the 1 in the bottom center, go left to the two, then up to the 6, and 9. That&amp;rsquo;s the longest path, so return a 4.
In this 3x3 case, it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to just brute force.</description></item><item><title>Phone Words--In English!</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/09/phone-words-in-english/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/09/phone-words-in-english/</guid><description>Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s take this one step further. Rather than generating just phone words, let&amp;rsquo;s actually generate phone words. Someone has provided a list of words in English as a package, so we&amp;rsquo;ll add a filter to add that to our comprehension:
from english_words import english_words_set def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -&amp;gt; List[str]: if not digits: return [] letters = { &amp;#39;1&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;2&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;abc&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;3&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;def&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;4&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;ghi&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;5&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;jkl&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;6&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;mno&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;7&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;pqrs&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;8&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;tuv&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;9&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;wxyz&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;0&amp;#39;: &amp;#39; &amp;#39;, } return [ word for product in itertools.</description></item><item><title>Phone Words</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/06/phone-words/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/06/phone-words/</guid><description>&lt;p>Working through a few problems on &lt;a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>Given a standard lettered keypad, generate all words from a given phone number.&lt;/p>
