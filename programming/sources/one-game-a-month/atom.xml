      <title>VTanks for Ludum Dare 26</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So when I got home, I decided that I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss another Ludum Dare. Granted, there was only about two hours left in the competition. I&amp;rsquo;m good, but I&amp;rsquo;m not that good. ðŸ˜„&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I really wanted to make a web-based game, which meant either write another game in Java (suboptimal) or learn how to write a game in Flash orÂ JavaScript. Nothing like a last minuteÂ decisionÂ to use an unfamiliar framework and write a game in less than 24 hours. ðŸ˜„&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I did it in six.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The House on the Hill - Postmortem</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I won&amp;rsquo;t have any time this weekend after all. So technically, I have another day, but I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be able to finish this in 7 days. This actually works out, since in hindsight I don&amp;rsquo;t think that Betrayal at House on the Hill&amp;rsquo;s mechanics actually translate quite as directly to a Roguelike as at first I thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The House on the Hill - Day 5</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not much in the way of screenshots today, but I did manage to add quite a lot of framework for content (which I&amp;rsquo;m going to spend tomorrow fleshing out). Now, the player has four stats (Might, Vigor, Intellect, and Sanity; I don&amp;rsquo;t think those were the original stats but I don&amp;rsquo;t have a copy at the moment to check). Each of them starts at a random value from 2 to 5. If any reaches 0, game over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, to actually make use of said stats, there are two new kinds of definitions that you can stick in the data folder to automatically be used by the game: events and items.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was fairly productive, although even with that I managed to fall a bit behind. So it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;ve made it to where I optimally would have been back on Monday, had I actually planned what I was going to do (and not changed ideas and frameworks literally as I was starting to work).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The House on the Hill â€“ Day 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem with starting with a (far) less common language is that you have to develop your own tools. That&amp;rsquo;s what I ended up spending most of the day doing in the case of Racket, although I think it ended up being a rather worthwhile endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week marks 2013&amp;rsquo;s 7-day Roguelike (7DRL) challenge, a contest where entrants attempt to write an entire Roguelike in 7 days. Since I haven&amp;rsquo;t started my #1GAM a month for March (and since my &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/02/01/#1gam-chesslike-1.0-did-it/&#34;&gt;successfully completed January game&lt;/a&gt; was a Roguelike as well), it seems like the perfectÂ opportunityÂ to kill two birds with one stone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>February #1GAM post-mortem</title>
      <link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/03/01/february-#1gam-post-mortem/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to write a post-mortem if you really only got about four hours into a game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, let&amp;rsquo;s hope so. That&amp;rsquo;s all the further I&amp;rsquo;ve made it with this month&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a title=&#34;One Game A Month&#34; href=&#34;http://onegameamonth.com/&#34;&gt;#1GAM&lt;/a&gt; a month&amp;ndash;and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much entirely my fault. The whole idea was to start earlier in the month and spread out the work out a bit&amp;hellip; That didn&amp;rsquo;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>#1GAM - ChessLike 1.0 - Did it!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well there you have it. Three days to a feature complete game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended cutting one of the kinds of levels, but other than that I got everything that I wanted in the game. It&amp;rsquo;s got 10 different kinds of pieces, 8 different kinds of levels (most procedurally generated), and statistics galore. It actually turned out to be kind of fun, although it&amp;rsquo;s a bit slower than I&amp;rsquo;d like. Not much I can do about that though without implementing a mouse interface (which I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do some day).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another day&amp;rsquo;s work on ChessLike. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a bit less full featured than yesterday, but I&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of progress towards the dungeon framework that I&amp;rsquo;m going for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back around the last &lt;a title=&#34;LudumDare&#34; href=&#34;http://www.ludumdare.com/&#34;&gt;Ludum Dare&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to try out &lt;a title=&#34;One Game A Month&#34; href=&#34;http://onegameamonth.com/&#34;&gt;One Game A Month&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, the goal is to write one complete game per month, every month in 2013. Of course I&amp;rsquo;m great at putting things off until the very last minute&amp;ndash;I finally started yesterday. So it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
