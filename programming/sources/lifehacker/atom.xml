The neat thing was that the dice had a mutually intransitive set of win probabilities, similar to rock paper scissors. So if your opponent chooses first and you choose the die that has the 5/9 edge over theirs, you will win about 5% more of the rolls (1/18). What the author claims is that this results in a 98% chance of winning over the course of 20 rolls.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
