&lt;p>I play a lot of board games. With the whole COVID-19 mess, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a lot on &lt;a href="https://boardgamearena.com/">Board Game Arena&lt;/a>, which is a wonderful site. But one thing that&amp;rsquo;s a bit lacking is having ratings / metadata about games to great games I&amp;rsquo;ve just not heard about before. Where can you get lots of that data? &lt;a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/">Board Game Geek&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem though, is merging the two. So, how do we do it? Well, this time around, I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with &lt;a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/252354/list-games-board-game-arena">this GeekList&lt;/a> that someone else maintains of BGA games on BGG. Which has the games, but no ranks. And apparently there are no ways to rank those by BGG (for some reason). But that&amp;rsquo;s easy when you know a bit of scripting!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
