It&amp;rsquo;s honestly as much a note for myself as anything, but perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ll find it useful too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem: We were having intermittent issues with a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/content%20security%20policy"&gt;content security policy&lt;/a&gt;. One of the warnings that cropped up was the inclusion of &lt;code&gt;'inline-speculation-rules'&lt;/code&gt; in the policy. This is currently only supported in Chrome and the issue was only appearing in Firefox. I could of course go through the effort of removing the header locally and testing&amp;ndash;but what if I could lie to the browser and change the header on the fly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for that, you have a number of options. &lt;a href="https://portswigger.net/burp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Burp Suite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ZAP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Charles Proxy&lt;/a&gt;. Many more, I&amp;rsquo;m sure. Any of these can modify traffic on the fly like that, but they&amp;rsquo;ll all designed for &lt;em&gt;so much more&lt;/em&gt; than that, making them a bit unwieldy. What I really wanted was something that was a whole lot smaller and did only this one thing (or could be at least configured as such)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="https://mitmproxy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mitmproxy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it before, but never quite like this. As the name suggests, &lt;code&gt;mitmproxy&lt;/code&gt; is designed to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/man-in-the-middle"&gt;man-in-the-middle&lt;/a&gt; yourself as a proxy&amp;ndash;feed all web requests through it and it can read requests, modify and forward (or block them), read responses, modify or replace them entirely, and all so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly what I needed!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
