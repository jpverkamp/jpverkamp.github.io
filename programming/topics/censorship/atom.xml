Like last year, I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting a paper at FOCI&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (Free and Open Communications on the Internet) entitled: &lt;em&gt;Five incidents, one theme: Twitter spam as a weapon to drown voices of protest&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social networking sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, have become an impressive force in the modern world with user bases larger than many individual countries. With such influence, they have become important in the process of worldwide politics. Those seeking to be elected often use social networking accounts to promote their agendas while those opposing them may seek to either counter those views or drown them in a sea of noise. Building on previous work that analyzed a Russian event where Twitter spam was used as a vehicle to suppress political speech, we inspect five political events from 2011 and 2012: two related to China and one each from Syria, Russia, and Mexico. Each of these events revolved around popular Twitter hashtags which were inundated with spam tweets intended to overwhelm the original content.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>ISMA 2013 AIMS-5 - DNS Based Censorship</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/02/09/isma-2013-aims-5-dns-based-censorship/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Feb 2013 15:00:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/02/09/isma-2013-aims-5-dns-based-censorship/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I gave a presentation about research that I&amp;rsquo;m just starting out studying DNS-based censorship in specific around the world. In particularly, preliminary findings in China have confirmed that the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great%20Firewall"&gt;Great Firewall&lt;/a&gt; is responding via packet injection to many queries for either Facebook or Twitter (among others). Interestingly, the pool of IPs that they return is consistent yet none of the IPs seem to resolve to anything interesting. In addition, there is fallout in South Korea where some percentage of packets go through China and thus have the same behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AIMS-5 - Day 3</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/02/09/aims-5-day-3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Feb 2013 14:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/02/09/aims-5-day-3/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the third and final day of AIMS-5. With the main topic being &lt;em&gt;Detection of Censorship, Filtering, and Outages&lt;/em&gt;, many of these talks were much more in line with what I know and what I&amp;rsquo;m working on. I gave my presentation as well, you can see it (along with a link to my slides) down below.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AIMS-5 - Day 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/02/08/aims-5-day-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2013 14:00:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/02/08/aims-5-day-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s agenda had discussions on Mobile Measurements and IPv6 Annotations, none of which are areas that I find myself particularly interested in.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting on Friday and I&amp;rsquo;ll share my slides when I get that far (they aren&amp;rsquo;t actually finished yet). I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about new work that I&amp;rsquo;m just getting off the ground focusing specifically on DNS-based censorship. There is a lot of interesting ground to cover there and this should be only the first in a series of updates about that work (I hope).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Scanning for DNS resolvers</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/31/scanning-for-dns-resolvers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2013 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/31/scanning-for-dns-resolvers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For a research project I&amp;rsquo;m working on, it has become necessary to scan potentially large &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cidr"&gt;IPv4 prefixes&lt;/a&gt; in order to find any &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS%20resolver"&gt;DNS revolvers&lt;/a&gt; that I can and classify them as either open (accepting queries from anyone) or closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is available on GitHub: &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/dnsscan" title="GitHub: jpverkamp: dnsscan"&gt;jpverkamp/dnsscan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Decoding escaped Unicode strings</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/17/decoding-escaped-unicode-strings/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jan 2013 14:00:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/01/17/decoding-escaped-unicode-strings/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In one of my current research projects involving large amounts of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/" title="Twitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; data from a variety of countries, I came across an interesting problem. The Twitter stream is encoded as a series of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; objects&amp;ndash;each of which has been written out using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII"&gt;ASCII&lt;/a&gt; characters. But not all of the Tweets (or even a majority in this case) can be represented with only ASCII. So what happens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out that they encode the data as JSON strings with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode"&gt;Unicode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escape%20characters"&gt;escape characters&lt;/a&gt;. So if we had the Russian hashtag #победазанами (victory is ours), that would be encoded as such:&lt;/p&gt;

Why? Because I&amp;rsquo;m presenting a paper at FOCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entitled &lt;em&gt;Inferring Mechanics of Web Censorship Around the World&lt;/em&gt;, here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While mechanics of Web censorship in China are well studied, those of other countries are less understood. Through a combination of personal contacts and Planet-Lab nodes, we conduct experiments to explore the mechanics of Web censorship in 11 countries around the world, including China. Our work provides insights into the diversity of modus operandi of censors around the world and can guide future work on censorship evasion.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
