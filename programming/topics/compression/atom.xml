Essentially, it&amp;rsquo;s a semi-structured set of text files that I keep in Dropbox. One for each day, in a folder by month. I record interesting people I see, things I did worth doing, and things my children did which were adorable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a while, I started wanting to look back, so first, I wrote a relatively simple script that would go back through my archives and send me everything I did 1/2/3/4/etc years ago. That worked well enough, but it ended up generating a lot of emails to go through some days. So the second generation is a server that can format those pages and display them as a nice webpage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most interesting part perhaps was dealing with the tarballs that I keep the archives in (they&amp;rsquo;re plain text, so they compress very well). I wanted to keep them compressed, so I had to decompress them in memory on the fly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AoC 2016 Day 9: Decompressinator</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/12/09/aoc-2016-day-9-decompressinator/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2016/12/09/aoc-2016-day-9-decompressinator/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="source-explosives-in-cyberspacehttpadventofcodecom2016day9">Source: &lt;a href="http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/9">Explosives in Cyberspace&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Part 1:&lt;/strong> A file is compressed by including compression markers of the form &lt;code>(#x#)...&lt;/code> where the first number tells how many characters to copy and the second is how many times to copy them. So &lt;code>A(2x3)HA!&lt;/code> becomes &lt;code>AHAHAHA!&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

Since they&amp;rsquo;re plain text, they&amp;rsquo;re generally rather compressible though, so it makes sense to &lt;code>gzip&lt;/code> them while they&amp;rsquo;re on disk. The drawback though comes when you&amp;rsquo;re working with them. There are a few options though.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
