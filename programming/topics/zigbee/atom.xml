Specifically, we have a projector, an HDMI switch, and multiple input devices connected to it (Apple TV, Steam Deck, Switch at the moment).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few things that are suboptimal with this setup, but so it goes. One thing that&amp;rsquo;s been bothering me for a while is that there&amp;rsquo;s no great way for the switch I have to easily switch devices. It has a remote&amp;hellip; but where&amp;rsquo;s the fun in that? (Plus we lost it for a few months).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I took this as a chance to finally set up an IR transmitter with &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Assistant&lt;/a>, using &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zigbee Home Automation&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a bit confusing to get it all working, so I&amp;rsquo;m sharing it half so I can reproduce what I did if I ever need to or so that anyone trying the same can get it working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of what I did was based first on &lt;a href="https://smarthomescene.com/reviews/tuya-zigbee-infrared-ir-remote-zs06-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this blog post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
