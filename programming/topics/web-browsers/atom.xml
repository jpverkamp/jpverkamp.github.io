A lot of those are turn based games with random people, but I have two subsets of games that I consider &amp;lsquo;more important&amp;rsquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Turn based games with people I know&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alpha games I&amp;rsquo;m testing&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, the first tends to have longer &amp;lsquo;per turn&amp;rsquo; times and the latter doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a timer at all, so both end up right at the very end of the sorted table list. But both, I&amp;rsquo;d rather play first and in-between other games.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Super niche problems, I know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Generally, my solution has been to keep a tab open for each of those games in a Firefox Tab Group, but in those cases, I keep navigating off those pages accidentally (thank you next table button).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Super &lt;em>super&lt;/em> niche problems, now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, I whipped up a quick userscript (I use ViolentMonkey) that will:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Detect if a tab I&amp;rsquo;m on is one of the games I want to &amp;rsquo;lock&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove the next table button (buttons; there are two different ones)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Disable navigation (at least make it pop up a warning)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Periodically refresh the tab (BGA tends to go to sleep in the background)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>A quick mitmproxy setup</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/19/a-quick-mitmproxy-setup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/19/a-quick-mitmproxy-setup/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another quick thing that I set up for the first time in a &lt;em>long&lt;/em> time. It&amp;rsquo;s honestly as much a note for myself as anything, but perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ll find it useful too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem: We were having intermittent issues with a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/content%20security%20policy">content security policy&lt;/a>. One of the warnings that cropped up was the inclusion of &lt;code>'inline-speculation-rules'&lt;/code> in the policy. This is currently only supported in Chrome and the issue was only appearing in Firefox. I could of course go through the effort of removing the header locally and testing&amp;ndash;but what if I could lie to the browser and change the header on the fly?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, for that, you have a number of options. &lt;a href="https://portswigger.net/burp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Burp Suite&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZAP&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Proxy&lt;/a>. Many more, I&amp;rsquo;m sure. Any of these can modify traffic on the fly like that, but they&amp;rsquo;ll all designed for &lt;em>so much more&lt;/em> than that, making them a bit unwieldy. What I really wanted was something that was a whole lot smaller and did only this one thing (or could be at least configured as such)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter &lt;a href="https://mitmproxy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>mitmproxy&lt;/code>&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it before, but never quite like this. As the name suggests, &lt;code>mitmproxy&lt;/code> is designed to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/man-in-the-middle">man-in-the-middle&lt;/a> yourself as a proxy&amp;ndash;feed all web requests through it and it can read requests, modify and forward (or block them), read responses, modify or replace them entirely, and all so much more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Exactly what I needed!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
