It takes the story of Gaborn and Raj Ahten, of Runelords and reavers, of elemental powers and far darker things, and brings it all together in a series of rather epic journeys and battles, culminating with an epic&ndash;if bittersweet&ndash;victory of light over dark, of good over evil.</p><p>Or does it?</p><p>Overall, it&rsquo;s a solid conclusion and I quite enjoyed it. If you&rsquo;ve made it this far in the series, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll have any problems with this particular book.</p><p>Characterwise, I really enjoyed almost all of the plotlines/character growth and change.</p><p>Gaborn and Iome&rsquo;s relationship is excellent, especially the idea that he&rsquo;s going to save the world&ndash;but she takes it upon herself to save <em>him</em> along the way. The really are just all around good guys and finally getting a decent conclusion to Gaborn&rsquo;s status as the Earth King after 4 books is nice. It&rsquo;s so bittersweet how <span class=spoiler>Gaborn ends up doomed to flare out and die so young in order to save the world</span>
.</p><p>Speaking of relationships, I really also love Myrrima and Borenson throughout the series but especially here. Thrown together basically by chance (or a twist of magic/fate), they&rsquo;re really grown together as each grows into/out of their own powers. She is <span class=spoiler>Waterborn</span>
but refuses to leave him&ndash;even if he can&rsquo;t at first believe that&rsquo;s even possible. He loses a lot of what makes him a powerful warrior and has to learn what it means to play second to her. And all throughout, they really do end up loving and respecting one another. I do enjoy how Farland does relationships in these series.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Myrrima asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I can do this anymore,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen too many Dedicates die.&rdquo;</p><p>Myrrima knew what he was thinking. He had been forced to butcher Raj Ahten&rsquo;s Dedicates at Castle Sylvarresta&ndash;thousands of men, women, and children in a single night. And he was thinking of his own Dedicates that Raj Ahten had murdered at the Blue Tower.</p><p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;the marquis was right about me. As a young man, I always wanted to be a Runelord. I wanted to prove myself, and I thought that taking endowments would make me powerful. But it doesn&rsquo;t just give you power. It gives you new responsibilities, and leaves you open to&mldr;whole new worlds of suffering.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Averan coming into her own as an Earth Warden is also fascinating, especially the (somewhat forecasted) reveal that she&rsquo;s the <span class=spoiler>Earth Warden of the Reavers</span>
. There&rsquo;s a lot more to explore there, I hope she has a part to play in future books. She is forced to grow a lot through these books and I really feel for her. Seeing the Fall/Winter of Binnesman&rsquo;s journey as an Earth Warden is powerful as well.</p><p>And then there&rsquo;s Raj Ahten. Oh he&rsquo;s quite the character. Starting as a baddie, I really did keep hoping he would get a redemption arc. Even as he grows more and more to serve Fire, I fully thought that all four elemental powers would be needed for something or the other. But by the end of the Lair of Bones&mldr; let&rsquo;s just say that it&rsquo;s a solid ending for quite the character arc.</p><p>Plotwise, it&rsquo;s still only a scant two weeks over the course of two books (which is insane), with this taking only 3 days. There&rsquo;s just so much going on. The journey (finally) into the underworld is epic, the reavers in their home turf and truely at battle are terrifying and the One True Master&ndash;well, let&rsquo;s say that Farland truely does have a way with words.</p><blockquote><p>And suddenly, Gaborn saw it.</p><p>A monstrosity appeared among the shadows, a reaver larger and more bloated than any fell mage he had ever encountered. Her feet clacked and her swollen belly groaned as she slid across the floor. A loud hissing followed as she scrabbled forward, air streaming from her vast anus.</p><p>The reek was magnificent. Gaborn could smell musty endowments, like putrid fat and rotten cabbages and moldy hair, so thick in the air that it choked him.</p></blockquote><p><em>Vast anus</em>. That is all.</p><p>Seriously though, I really like how believably &lsquo;alien&rsquo; Farland made the reavers. I hope for more of that as well.</p><p>OVerall, as I said. A fitting conclusion. I know that the next book in the series is basically the first in a sequel series all it&rsquo;s own with a mostly new cast and I also remember having trouble with it last time around. But it&rsquo;s time to try again I think. Onward!</p><p>Random side note:</p><blockquote><p>Gaborn counted the ribs, and found that it had been a girl, a small child of perhaps four or five. The girl had been curled in a fetal position with her thumb in her mouth when she died. A blanket was wrapped around her, an Inkarran blanket woven from long strands of white goat hair.</p></blockquote><p>&mldr; even in this world? Men and women have the same number of ribs. Why would that be a common belief in a world without a Judeo-Christian creation mythology?</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Except it&rsquo;s book 4 of currently 9&mldr; But the next book always involves a timeskip and mostly completely new characters, so I suppose that is fair.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div><footer id=page-footer role=contentinfo><nav id=footer-navigation role=navigation class=ribbon><ul class=main-navigation><li><a href=/archive-by-date/>All posts: By Date</a></li><li><a href=/archive-by-tag/>All posts: By Tag</a></li><li><a href=/atom.xml>RSS: All <sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li><li><a href=/reviews/atom.xml>RSS: reviews<sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li></ul></nav><div id=page-footer-content><div class=legal><p>All posts unless otherwise mentioned are licensed under
