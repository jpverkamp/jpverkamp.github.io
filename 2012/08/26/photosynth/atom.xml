It&amp;rsquo;s really quite a nice looking piece of architecture. Also quite different from all of the very traditional cross-shaped churches I grew up with.&lt;/p>

&lt;div>
 :sad: There should have been a Photosynth here, but photosynths no longer exist. I bet it was cool too.

Full stop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where else can you get a menu that looks like an RPG rulebook and has items like the Poached Spaghetti Monster, +2 Tots, or the Reaver (I had that, it&amp;rsquo;s huge&amp;hellip;). You can check out their &lt;a title="AFK Tavern Menu" href="http://files.afktavern.com/menu1.0.pdf">online menu&lt;/a>, but really just go check the place out. It&amp;rsquo;s well worth it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Conference center and Seattle Walking</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/08/08/conference-center-and-seattle-walking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2012 17:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/08/08/conference-center-and-seattle-walking/</guid><description>&lt;p>First, a few photosynths from the hotel where the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/08/06/usenix/foci-2012-inferring-mechanics-of-web-censorship-around-the-world/">conference&lt;/a> was:&lt;/p>

Yes, my parents flew into Portland for a wedding. Yes, we want to go to Vancouver for dinner, despite that fact that it&amp;rsquo;s a two and a half hour drive away from Seattle. What&amp;rsquo;s so hard about that Mr. Border Crossing guy?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Photosynth at the EMP Museum</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/08/07/photosynth-at-the-emp-museum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Aug 2012 21:00:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/08/07/photosynth-at-the-emp-museum/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since we were in Seattle and since my father is a huge Jimi Hendrix buff, we had to go to the &lt;a title="EMP Museum" href="http://www.empmuseum.org/">EMP Museum&lt;/a> (formerly known as both the Experience Music Project and Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame or EMP|SFM). Basically, it has exhibits all about &lt;a title="The Official Jimi Hendrix Site" href="http://www.jimihendrix.com/us/home">Jimi Hendrix&lt;/a>, &lt;a title="Nirvana Site" href="http://www.nirvana.com/">Nirvana&lt;/a>, &lt;a title="AC/DC Home" href="http://www.acdc.com/us/home">AC/DC&lt;/a> and probably a number of others, along with a room full of science fiction memorabilia and another dedicated to &lt;a title="Avatar (2009) on IMDb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/">James Cameron&amp;rsquo;s Avatar&lt;/a>. I highly recommend checking it out if you&amp;rsquo;re in the Seattle area and into either music or science fiction (particularly if you&amp;rsquo;re do both).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Photosynth at the Seattle Public Library</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/08/07/photosynth-at-the-seattle-public-library/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Aug 2012 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/08/07/photosynth-at-the-seattle-public-library/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here are a few more Photosynths from Seattle, this time from the Seattle Public Library. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit to being more than a little impressed with the place. Why don&amp;rsquo;t we have something like this in Indiana?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, we have the Seattle Public Library from the atrium overlook (there&amp;rsquo;s a little platform you can sort of see if you turn to the right which I&amp;rsquo;m guessing is designed for exactly this sort of thing):&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Photosynth Tour of Seattle</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/08/07/photosynth-tour-of-seattle/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Aug 2012 17:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/08/07/photosynth-tour-of-seattle/</guid><description>&lt;p>While I was at &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2012/08/06/usenix/foci-2012-inferring-mechanics-of-web-censorship-around-the-world/">Usenix/FOCI&lt;/a>, I met up with my parents who were in Portland anyways for a wedding. Since I had Tuesday off from the conference, we decided to explore Seattle. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have my camera with me, but I did have my iPhone, so I decided to play with the (amazing) &lt;a title="iTunes App Store: Photosynth" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;ved=0CF8QFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fphotosynth%2Fid430065256%3Fmt%3D8&amp;amp;ei=fqIuUKK2H-KbyQHcq4DICg&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHcHlb1n5RnBpJwaOI0zJSjC7vw4w&amp;amp;sig2=KDbGFNYkM3USfjgVmtWjHw">Photosynth app&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s Microsoft and Apple products working together, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t have fun with it!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
