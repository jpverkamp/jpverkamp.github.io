I took a gun.</p><p>In hindsight&ndash;which is of course 20/20&ndash;that may not have been the best idea I&rsquo;d ever had.</p><p>I knew how to use a gun at least, that much was true. I couldn&rsquo;t have made it through my training if I hadn&rsquo;t. I knew how to clean them, assemble them, even fire them. But I&rsquo;d never once fired a gun at a living target with the intention of killing them. In the parlance of my fellow soldiers, I had yet to be truly tested in battle.</p><p>Barring extreme circumstances, as a chaplain, I wasn&rsquo;t even permitted to carry one of my own. Even medics could carry a small personal firearm and still receive some protection under the Geneva Convention&ndash;although that little protection didn&rsquo;t matter much when it came right down to the action&ndash;but not chaplains. Something about religious convictions I supposed.</p><p>But I was sick of the situation being out of my control.</p><p>My training as a priest was telling me that I had to back off and trust that God had a plan for the whole situation. That everything would work out in the end. But I knew better than that. I knew that sometimes God&rsquo;s plan <em>was</em> for you to take action. Sometimes you had to be the hand of God in the world. The hard part was telling the difference.</p><p>My training as a soldier was telling me that I should obey orders. But that would mean abandoning Amira to whatever fate those men that had taken her from me had in mind. It wasn&rsquo;t a possibility that I could in good conscious choose, despite all of the conditioning I&rsquo;d undergone during my training.</p><p>And a lifetime of training as a decent human being was telling me that I had to go and find her. I hadn&rsquo;t known her long, but in that time, I would say that we&rsquo;d become good friends. We&rsquo;d trusted each other enough to talk about our life stories&ndash;and even more, some of my own blood now flowed through her veins. I knew that wasn&rsquo;t a particularly good reason, but I couldn&rsquo;t get her out of my head. I had to help her.</p><p>In the end, I went with the first and last options. I could only pray that I was doing the right thing and that God would support me in my madness and forgive me after.</p><p>So I grabbed my spare uniform and a few supplies. And then I stole a gun. I paused for a moment to ask God for forgiveness for what I was about to do, although I hoped that stealing it was going to be</p><p>Luckily I knew where all of the men that I generally bunked with kept their guns while they were asleep. Not many were actually in bed, despite the hour&ndash;the attack had seen to that&ndash;but there were at least two. But I got hold of a small handgun. It didn&rsquo;t have much stopping power, but it was already more than I was really comfortable with. Perhaps I could at least hold someone off for a precious few seconds if it came down to it.</p><p>Honestly, I felt a little bad about taking it, beyond the obvious sin of stealing. I knew that they were going to be in almost as much trouble as I was when they woke up and found the gun missing. Perhaps I would get it back before he did. That would be something at least.</p><p>I tucked the gun into the back of my pants, hoping that the rest of my uniform would be enough to hide it&ndash;and that it wouldn&rsquo;t accidentally go off; that would be awkward to explain. Better that than walking out into the night with it in my hands though. If anyone saw that, they&rsquo;d be sure to raise the alarm.</p><p>As ready as I was ever going to be, I set off into the night. Of course, it didn&rsquo;t take long for trouble to find me. It never does.</p><h1 id=109---baghdad>109 - Baghdad</h1><p><strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO</strong>
I made it only as far as the entrance to the compound when I was stopped by two men that I recognized all too well. It was Lee and Rush, the men that had gone with me the last time I&rsquo;d gone to the museum.</p><p>On one hand, I was glad that they had survived. I was ashamed to admit that I&rsquo;d been to busy to really give them more than a passing thought since I&rsquo;d gotten back.</p><p>On the other, they were standing between me and my mission&ndash;and they didn&rsquo;t look like they wanted to let me through. They hadn&rsquo;t noticed the gun, but I was sure there were orders not to let anyone out.</p><p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; I said as neutrally as I could. Perhaps I was all worked out for nothing.</p><p>But Lee just shook his head and Rush actually spit on the ground. &ldquo;Not <em>that</em> good,&rdquo; Lee said, &ldquo;or did you manage to miss that whole mess?&rdquo;</p><p>Mentally, I winced. Perhaps &lsquo;<em>good</em> evening&rsquo; hadn&rsquo;t been the best way to word it. Still, nothing about not leaving just yet. &ldquo;Yeah, I saw all of that. Crazy, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>The two men looked at each other for a moment. It was Rush that responded this time. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one way of looking at it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think they were after?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I heard they took the girl,&rdquo; Lee said a heartbeat before Rush realized what he was saying and seemed to hiss at him. Lee shut his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Amira?&rdquo; I asked, half playing dumb. My heart was already sinking though. They knew more than enough about our friendship to be dangerous. If they&rsquo;d been given orders to keep people from leaving the base, they&rsquo;d surely know that those orders had to have been meant specifically for me.</p><p>Neither of the men said a word about her though, although I thought I saw Lee start to nod. The movement was slight though and cut off at a glance at Rush.</p><p>After a perfectly awkward pause, I decided to just go for it. &ldquo;So I was thinking about heading out for a walk.&rdquo;</p><p>Perhaps they hadn&rsquo;t figured out why I was there. The looks on their faces would have been comical had I not been on something of a limited time frame.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t&mldr;&rdquo; Lee started to say, but he was interrupted by Rush, &ldquo;we have orders&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>Both of them stopped talking, but after a moment, Lee nodded, acquiescing to Rush&rsquo;s seniority, slight as it was. &ldquo;Not this evening, you can&rsquo;t. Orders are that everyone stays on base.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t look particularly suspicious at least, but rather guarded.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go far,&rdquo; I said, but I was already thinking about other ways out. Perhaps I could sneak up to the rooftops and go over? They&rsquo;d been secured&ndash;otherwise enemy forces could surely have done exactly that&ndash;but surely that would have been to keep people out, not in.</p><p>Rush was shaking his head, but Lee seemed to be softening. &ldquo;Come on, just for a bit,&rdquo; he was saying to Rush. &ldquo;You know what they said he went though.&rdquo;</p><p>Rush turned to me though, and after a moment, Lee&rsquo;s attention followed. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rush said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t actually know what happened to you. I&rsquo;ve heard all sorts of rumors, but they can&rsquo;t all be true. After all, you can&rsquo;t be both for us and against us, now can you?&rdquo;</p><p><em>Just what sort of rumors had there been while I&rsquo;d been away? Or worse yet, since I&rsquo;d come back?</em> I hadn&rsquo;t really considered it. I was still having trouble believing that it wasn&rsquo;t all just a giant hoax, that it really could possibly have been so much later.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t particularly a conversation that I wanted to have though. Not now. I didn&rsquo;t have the time to convince these men that I was innocent. Particularly if even they were doubting my story. After all, they&rsquo;d been there when I&rsquo;d been shot. They must have known that I couldn&rsquo;t have faked that much at least.</p><p>I half turned away from them. &ldquo;I guess I don&rsquo;t need that walk after all.&rdquo; I knew that was only going to bring the worse rumors to the forefront in their minds, but I didn&rsquo;t have time. Tomorrow would be time enough for damage control.</p><p>I could already see the doubt darkening their eyes, but I continued to turn away, heading back into the center of the base.</p><p>Only to run almost directly into the Sergent who apparently had been standing right behind for who knew how long.</p></div></article></div></div><footer id=page-footer role=contentinfo><nav id=footer-navigation role=navigation class=ribbon><ul class=main-navigation><li><a href=/archive-by-date/>All posts: By Date</a></li><li><a href=/archive-by-tag/>All posts: By Tag</a></li><li><a href=/atom.xml>RSS: All <sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li><li><a href=/writing/atom.xml>RSS: writing<sup><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li></ul></nav><div id=page-footer-content data-pagefind-ignore=all><div class=legal><p>All posts unless otherwise mentioned are licensed under
