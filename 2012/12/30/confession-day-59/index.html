<div class=entry-content><h1 id=126---chicago>126 - Chicago</h1>
<p><strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO</strong>
&ldquo;So let me get this straight,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead. Your brother is dead. Everyone is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure. Perhaps it was a bit of an overreaction. But my head was still spinning from that particular revelation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he seemed to rather take me at my word. &ldquo;Everyone isn&rsquo;t dead. Just the two of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that even mean though. You look perfectly fine.&rdquo; I reached out and poked him in the arm. Completely solid, although a bit cool. Not zero body heat cool though, just a regular cool natured person sort of cool. There was that slight smell though that I had first noticed back when I&rsquo;d first met him. Back when all of this mess had started up again. It felt so very long ago.</p>
<p>Something like wet leather and dog fur. Still strange and just a bit on the disgusting side, but not enough that I would have even bothered to look for it on a crowded bus had I smelled the same. But now that I noticed it, I realized just how often I&rsquo;d smelled it before. Just how often it seemed associated with the strangest of things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get that,&rdquo; I said, a bit of an edge making its way into my voice. &ldquo;But why does it just so happen to be both you and your bother that are all no-longer-dead? Shouldn&rsquo;t that sort of thing be rare?&rdquo; Come to think of it, counting Private Jackson, why did I personally keep bumping into these sorts of things. Was God trying to tell me something?</p>
<p>John just shrugged though. &ldquo;I have no idea. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly my choice in the matter. I never intended Alex to go through&mldr;&rdquo; His voice trailed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go through what?&rdquo; I prompted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go through this.&rdquo; He gestured vaguely at the room all around him, at the gun in his hand, down at himself. &ldquo;To have to keep on living well past your appointed time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have thought that most people would be thrilled with the opportunity not to die,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;To have just one more day with their loved ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw his face fall. &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s just the problem, isn&rsquo;t it. It isn&rsquo;t a matter of one more day. One more day is great. It&rsquo;s the days after that. The weeks. The months. They can tell you know, they can always tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I blinked at him. He was getting harder and harder to follow. &ldquo;What can they tell? And who are they for that matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone,&rdquo; he answered, abruptly standing and walking across the room. &ldquo;They can always tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell what?&rdquo; I asked again, following him. He&rsquo;d set the gun down on a counter and appeared to be staring at some sort of abstract painting on the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;m dead.&rdquo; Just as suddenly, he spun around, closing the distance between the two of us before I could so much as react. He got right up in my face, bringing a fresh whiff of that scent right into my nostrils. At this distance, I almost gagged, the smell was even more obvious and cloying. &ldquo;How would you like it if one by one, everyone you&rsquo;d ever cared about, everyone you ever knew, one by one, they left you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes were bloodshot. That was really all that I could think about with his face so close to my own. That and the smell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I wouldn&rsquo;t much like that,&rdquo; I said finally, my brain catching up with what I&rsquo;d heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I guess you wouldn&rsquo;t like that at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about your family.&rdquo; If he&rsquo;d <em>died</em> so long before Alex, then that meant that when he&rsquo;d realized that Alex had come back he&rsquo;d already been dead. But he&rsquo;d been with his family then. &ldquo;Surely they don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He just shook his head though, &ldquo;oh, they&rsquo;re nice enough about it. They pretend not to notice. But I know. Deep down, I always know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honestly, it sounded to me like he had problems running more deeply than simply being dead. If I hadn&rsquo;t been so sure that I&rsquo;d just seem him shoot himself in the head to absolutely no ill effect, I wouldn&rsquo;t even have believed that anything was physically wrong with him at all. But that&mldr; that was something that I couldn&rsquo;t easily explain away. There had to be another explanation though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, you know,&rdquo; he abruptly went on. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I wanted to do it. That&rsquo;s why I still want to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head slightly. &ldquo;To do what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To send Alex back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To wherever he was. Back to the grave. Even if he was in Hell itself, it has to be better than being stuck back here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>SEVERAL YEARS AGO</strong>
Either our commanding officer was a tactical genius&ndash;or someone up there really was on our side.</p>
<p>Only moments after we were surrounded&ndash;with guns inside the building ready to tear us apart if we went in and a dozen guns or more keeping us from going back out&ndash;there was a sudden chatter of gunfire from one side of the building. Even better, the cadence of these guns sounded blessedly familiar. These were the guns I&rsquo;d trained with even when they knew that I would never use them on the field of battle. These were the guns that my fellow soldiers used day in and day out around our makeshift base.</p>
<p>These were our men.</p>
<p>The others, those that were all but holding us hostage turned to face this new threat, almost as one. It would have been impressive had it not also been such a tactically poor decision. I even realized it, no more than a fraction of a second after the Sergent did as well. They hadn&rsquo;t actually disarmed us, so why in the world did they think we were the lesser threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open fire,&rdquo; the Sergent yelled, but he didn&rsquo;t have to. The men knew what to do.</p>
<p>It was a slaughter.</p>
<p>A part of me hated every moment of it. I had applied for and been granted the position of a not only a chaplain because I thought I could do some good. I thought that perhaps I could save even one soldier&rsquo;s soul from the irreparable damage that wartime could bring. Even so, I knew that death was going to be a part of the job. But this was just brutal. Our weapons were designed for one thing and did that one thing very well&ndash;to kill.</p>
<p>Yet, I&rsquo;m ashamed to say it, another part of me reveled in the violence. They say that there&rsquo;s the deeper, more reptilian part of our brains from long ago that are hardwired to violence. I don&rsquo;t know about all of those stories about coming from apes&ndash;the Church&rsquo;s viewpoint was that evolution occurred, albeit guided by God, but there was just something about mankind&mldr;&ndash;but I knew what I felt. And what I felt was a thrill at seeing my side come out ahead. To take back what was ours and to strike back for truth, for justice.</p>
<p>All of the words that I&rsquo;d shared with the young soldier back in the medic&rsquo;s tent were going right out of my head. A part of me knew that these were fellow human beings&ndash;but a part of me didn&rsquo;t care. A part of me knew that the vast majority of them were just following orders, the same as we were&ndash;but another part of me didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>A part of me looked inwards and was sickened by what it saw.</p>
<p>But another part of me looked outward and thought of all that I&rsquo;d been put through in the past weeks. All that Amira was surely having to face right now.</p>
<p>And that part of me rejoiced.</p>

<p><strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO</strong>
If John were still dead set on <em>helping</em> his brother, then at the moment his reasoning was less important.</p>
<p><em>One problem at a time.</em></p>
<p>I knew that John needed help, but so did Alex.</p>
<p>And Mrs. Claire.</p>
<p>And I was bound for Rome in only a few days time, on the orders of the mysterious man with the silver hair&ndash;who come to think of, I could barely make out any more. That was strange.</p>
<p>But the important part was that John was willing to help me.</p>
<p>As mercurial as he was acting and as crazy as it sounded, he was willing to go to his parent&rsquo;s house and procure the urn that held Alex&rsquo;s remains&ndash;for since he&rsquo;d committed suicide, he could no longer be buried in the Catholic cemetery.</p>
<p>I knew there was a chance that something had gone horribly sideways and that Alex&rsquo;s remains weren&rsquo;t actually there, but that was another bridge to put off until we came to it.</p>
<p><em>One problem at a time.</em></p>
<p>I made the arrangements; he would collect the ashes and meet us back at Mrs. Claire&rsquo;s, as soon as possible. I figured that it would take at least a few hours, but that would give me the time I needed to make any other arrangements. Amanda was collecting supplies for me, but Sister Kat&rsquo;s instructions had been precise and there was more than enough preparations that had to be done.</p>
<p>I made sure to ask John to leave the gun behind. I had a feeling that just him showing up again at Mrs. Claire&rsquo;s was going to be enough of a problem&ndash;even if Mrs. Claire herself didn&rsquo;t quiet remember all of the details of our prior visit&ndash;but every little bit would help.</p>
<p>In any case, I did manage to convince him that a gun wouldn&rsquo;t do him any good anyways. He&rsquo;d already tried it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, mentioning the gun only seemed to agitate John and he spent the rest of the time I was there with the gun back in his hand, using it as a pointer and gesturing wildly at times. I had no way of knowing if it was loaded, so I fell back to the old saying to treat all guns as if they were loaded&ndash;even if you&rsquo;d personally checked just a minute ago. So I ducked and waved, trying to stay out of John&rsquo;s way as he talked emphatically.</p>
<p>I had a feeling the gun was going to be a problem, but it too went on the list of things that were going to have to wait to be dealt with.</p>
<p><em>One problem at a time.</em></p>
<p>That left actually learning a bit more about what I was about to attempt. Sister Kat had made is sound like a prayer with a bit more in the way of physical talismans than I was used to, but the more I read over it, the more it sounded like some sort of pagan spell.</p>
<p>Even knowing what little I knew about Sister Kat&rsquo;s background, that was a touch surprising.</p>
<p>Where in the world could she have learned such things?</p>
<p>And just how certain was she that they were going to work?</p>
<p>But I had to have faith in her. She wouldn&rsquo;t let me down, she never had. If she said that the spells&ndash;there really wasn&rsquo;t anything else to call them&ndash;would work, then that was just what I was going to have to do.</p>
<p>The ends may never justify the choices one makes, but sometimes there just were no more good choices to be made.</p></div>
