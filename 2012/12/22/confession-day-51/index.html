<div class=entry-content><h1 id=112---chicago>112 - Chicago</h1>
<p><strong>SEVERAL WEEKS AGO</strong>
I never would have expected to be going back to Mrs. Claire&rsquo;s so soon. But I needed supplies. If I could believe what Sister Kat had said&ndash;and I had no particular reason to doubt her&ndash;then there were things that I wouldn&rsquo;t have the first idea how to find.</p>
<p>But I knew someone who did.</p>
<p>And if my hunch was right, Alex would be there as well.</p>
<p>It took a moment for Mrs. Claire to answer the door. It was getting on in the day and I doubted that she&rsquo;d had a customer&ndash;after all, hadn&rsquo;t she said that Alex was driving them all away? So when she answered the door, I got right to the point. &ldquo;I think I figured out how to get rid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only then, that I noticed that she wasn&rsquo;t alone. Amanda was still there, standing right behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean&mldr; I mean, I didn&rsquo;t&mldr; I didn&rsquo;t see you standing there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you meant exactly what you said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There really wasn&rsquo;t anything that I could say. She had a point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; Mrs. Claire said, going at least a tiny bit towards diffusing the situation. She stood out of the way and held the door for me.</p>
<p>I went in, carefully not meeting Amanda&rsquo;s eyes. The bigger problem was though that she may actually have been the one that I would need to procure some of the items on the list.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what did you find out?&rdquo; Mrs. Claire said. I noticed that she wasn&rsquo;t meeting Amanda&rsquo;s gaze either. &ldquo;Can you exorcise him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head. Mrs. Claire&rsquo;s expression fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the time to learn how to do an exorcism,&rdquo; I admitted. At least not properly. And it seemed that was one sort of thing that you didn&rsquo;t want to do halfway. &ldquo;But I think we have another option.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her features perked back up, but there was a wary tone to her expression now. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as you may have noticed, it seems that the world is a pretty strange place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded, still apprehensive. I noticed that Amanda was listening closely too and to my surprise, her expression looked more hopeful than anything. Perhaps I wasn&rsquo;t reading it correctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that all of the old stories are true. Not only are their ghosts, but there are truly old ways to keep them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She just looked at me, but this time I saw that Amanda was nodding. Perhaps she would end up being the more useful of the two after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just need a few supplies. Then I think we can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda spoke up. &ldquo;Do what exactly?&rdquo; Her voice was soft, but there was a strength running through each syllable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, according to my source&ndash;&rdquo; That felt strange saying it that way, but she had asked to remain anonymous. &ldquo;&ndash;we&rsquo;ll be able to keep him away from here at least. That&rsquo;s the first step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First step implies that there are more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one more.&rdquo; And this one was the more troublesome of the two. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s come back, that means that at least some part of his earthly body is anchoring him here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was already nodding as I was speaking, as if she knew where this was going. &ldquo;The second step will be to deal with those remains. Really, there are three options. We can move them&mldr;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Claire shook her head, &ldquo;but won&rsquo;t that just move Alex&rsquo;s&mldr; whatever he is now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded. That was exactly the problem. It reminded me of Private Jackson&rsquo;s body all those years ago. Once his body had left the country, I&rsquo;d never seen him again&mldr;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second option would be to destroy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was already cremated,&rdquo; Amanda said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is strange,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Normally none of this would be possible if he had been cremated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If?&rdquo; Amanda&rsquo;s voice rose in pitch. &ldquo;I was there. I saw the ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re sure that they were his?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t want to have to ask, but I needed the answer. If it hadn&rsquo;t actually been his body that had been cremated, the problem became at once easier&ndash;we wouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with destroying a body that had already been destroyed&ndash;and harder&ndash;if it hadn&rsquo;t been cremated, what had happened to it?</p>
<p>Luckily though, she nodded. Her words didn&rsquo;t sound quite as confident though. &ldquo;I mean, it had to have been. Right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cross that bridge when we come to it.&rdquo; Either way, we had options. Not ones that I particularly cared to start with, but options nevertheless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a third option?&rdquo; Mrs. Claire asked.</p>
<p>I nodded. I hadn&rsquo;t been sure that I was going to bring it up, but now that she had asked. &ldquo;Alex was Catholic, yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was buried without a Catholic funeral.&rdquo; It was more a statement than a question. Given the circumstances of his death, there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any other choice.</p>
<p>Mrs. Claire looked at me blankly, but Amanda nodded. The look on her face told me that she&rsquo;d already come to the same conclusion that I had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then. That would be the third option.&rdquo;</p></div>
