Time seemed not so much to slow as to go sideways for a moment, a whole series of things not happening so much as at once but rather in a timeless sort of mishmash.</p><p>John pulled the trigger, there was a flash of light and&ndash;at this range&ndash;a deafening crack.</p><p>I cried out in some combination horror and far-too-late warning.</p><p>I saw the bullet explode outward from John&rsquo;s head, although something seemed wrong about that, although I couldn&rsquo;t put my finger quite on what.</p><p>John stayed resolutely upright in his chair, his arm not even so much as slackening its grip on his gun.</p><p>My gaze followed the bullet&rsquo;s trajectory to the wall only to find no blood sprayed their, but rather a nice cluster of bullet holes, each a perfect crater of plaster.</p><p>John turned to me, lowering the gun as he did. There was no sign at all of a wound on his head.</p><p>Time collected itself, catching and starting up once again back on its everyday course.</p><p>&ldquo;Padre, how could to see you again. Have you heard anything more about my brother?&rdquo;</p><p>Just that, completely ignoring the fact that I&rsquo;d just seem him completely ignore a suicide attempt that&ndash;even if it could have failed&ndash;shouldn&rsquo;t have failed quite so completely.</p><p>&ldquo;You&mldr; What&mldr; With the&mldr;&rdquo; I stuttered. Time was flowing again, but my thoughts were having a bit more of an issue.</p><p>&ldquo;What, this?&rdquo; He gestured at the gun. As if there were anything else I could have been mumbling about. &ldquo;Funny story that.&rdquo; He sounded almost creepily cheerful.</p><p><em>Funny?</em></p><p><em><strong>Funny?</strong></em></p><p>John had a warped sense of humor if seemed. He continued on though, shifting back to his previous topic, &ldquo;I bet you figured out how to get rid of him, didn&rsquo;t you? I knew you could do it. Don&rsquo;t ask me how I knew, but I just knew it.&rdquo;</p><p>He was rambling a bit now, but at least I had managed to take back some measure of my voice. &ldquo;How did you do that?&rdquo;</p><p>He just shook his head, slowly, avoiding the question. &ldquo;But why are you here then, if you figured it out? Why would you need my help? I tried to shoot you after all.&rdquo; He voice kept alternating between cheerful and distressed, fast enough that it was really troubling.</p><p>Two could play at that game though, avoiding questions. I could be every bit as stubborn as him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not human, are you? You&rsquo;re like an angel or something.&rdquo;</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t really make sense even as it came out of my mouth, but I couldn&rsquo;t think of another alternative. Granted, even after meeting Michael in person, I didn&rsquo;t really know much more about angels than the Sunday school stories I&rsquo;d grown up on. Not much in the way if surviving self inflicted gunshot wounds without so much of a scratch in those.</p><p>But John was just shaking his head. &ldquo;An angel?&rdquo; At least it was part of an answer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m an angel. I don&rsquo;t feel much like an angel. What does an angel feel like?&rdquo;</p><p>He was scanning downwards, down his own frame. When he got to the gun, he jerked slightly. I wouldn&rsquo;t even have noticed had I not been watching him carefully, but as if was, the movement caught my attention and wouldn&rsquo;t let go.</p><p>Why would he be surprised by his own gun? By the gun he&rsquo;d just used <em>on himself</em>.</p><p>&ldquo;No, definitely not an angel,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Then what are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nothing,&rdquo; he said, shifting back to terribly sad once again. &ldquo;Not any more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What in the world does that mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It means that my brother isn&rsquo;t the only one that&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p><p>I blinked at him. Was he saying what I thought he was saying? &ldquo;How can you be dead?&rdquo; Without taking a moment to think about it, I reached out and poked him. He felt normal enough, if a bit cool to the touch. Not unnaturally though. &ldquo;You can touch things.&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugged. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea. Not why I&rsquo;m still here, nor why I can touch things and Alex cannot. I don&rsquo;t even know why Alex came back in the first place.&rdquo;</p><p>I thought we&rsquo;d narrowed down that one at least. Mrs. Claire had a bit more power than she was letting on, somehow bound together with that piece of pottery. Instinctively, my thoughts went to the wall safe I&rsquo;d stored that shard in. I hadn&rsquo;t checked it since yesterday, but it was still safe&ndash;right?</p><p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; I asked. I didn&rsquo;t have to specify which question I meant. &ldquo;How?&rdquo; I knew it was a rather personal question, but at the moment, I was too stunned to care.</p><p>He answered both, &ldquo;It was a car crash. Years ago. I&rsquo;d always thought that I&rsquo;d just miraculously survived somehow. But then when Alex died&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>His gaze fell down to the gun still in his hands and his words faded. But he didn&rsquo;t need to continue. I had a feeling I knew exactly where he was coming from.</p></div></article></div></div><footer id=page-footer role=contentinfo><nav id=footer-navigation role=navigation class=ribbon><ul class=main-navigation><li><a href=/archive-by-date/>All posts: By Date</a></li><li><a href=/archive-by-tag/>All posts: By Tag</a></li><li><a href=/atom.xml>RSS: All <sup><svg width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li><li><a href=/writing/atom.xml>RSS: writing<sup><svg width="8" height="8" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="#fff" d="M6.503 20.752C6.503 22.546 5.047 24 3.252 24c-1.796.0-3.252-1.454-3.252-3.248s1.456-3.248 3.252-3.248c1.795.001 3.251 1.454 3.251 3.248zM0 8.18v4.811c6.05.062 10.96 4.966 11.022 11.009h4.817C15.777 15.29 8.721 8.242.0 8.18zm0-3.368C10.58 4.858 19.152 13.406 19.183 24H24c-.03-13.231-10.755-23.954-24-24v4.812z"/></svg></sup></a></li></ul></nav><div id=page-footer-content data-pagefind-ignore=all><div class=legal><p>All posts unless otherwise mentioned are licensed under
