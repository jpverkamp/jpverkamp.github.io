syntax:
  NODE                    = NAME PARAMS? BLOCK?

  PARAMS                  = "(" delimited(PARAM, ",") ")"
  PARAM                   = NAME (":" DEFAULT)?

  BLOCK                   = NODE | STACK | LIST
  STACK                   = "{" NODE+ "}"
  LIST                    = "[" NODE+ "]" 
                          | "[" NODE "for" NAME "in" ITERABLE "]"
                          | "[" NODE "times" EXPRESSION "]"

  ITERABLE                = EXPRESSION ".." EXPRESSION | NAME | LIST | "(" delimited(EXPRESSION, ",") ")"

terminals:                all terminals either have () for params or if no () then assume defaults for all params

  null                    - draws nothing (mostly used to fill spaces in a stacker)
  circle                  - draws a circle with the current stoke/fill
  circleText(s: "")       - circle of text instead of a line
  arc(min: 0, max: 0.5)   - draws an arc around the circle, 0 is up, goes clockwise up to 1; can also use 1rad / 45deg units
  line(min: 0, max: 1)    - draws a vertical line, min/max are 0 at the center, 1 at the top, -1 at the bottom of the current region
  polygon(n: 4)           - draws a polygon with a point upwards, equivalent to star(n, 1)
  star(n: 5, m: 2)        - draws a star with a point upwards with n points and m points between each, a standard star is star(5, 2)
  text(s: "")             - a string of text
  character(i: 32)        - a character represented by a unicode codepoint as an integer

modifiers:                all modifiers include the next element automatically, use a {} block if you want to apply to more than one

  double(offset: 0.1)     - repeat the child twice with the given scaling factor
  scale(n: 1)             - scale children by the scaling factor, 0 is none, 1 is no scale, 2 is double
  translate(x:0, y:0)     - offset by by proportion of current size, -1 to 1 would be an entire shift left/right for example
  rotate(a: 0.25)         - rotate by the given value, unitless is 0 to 1 for a full circle, can also specify units: 1rad, 90deg
  invert                  - equivalent to rotate(0.5)
  fill(color: "black")    - change the fill of all children to the given value
  stroke(                 - change the stroke weight/color of all children to the given values
    weight: 1,
    color: "black"
  )                       

stackers:                 work like modifiers that apply to a group created with [] instead of a single element

  radial(                 - arrange the list of children in a circle
    scale: 1/n,               apply to each child, n (number of children) can be used in any expressions
    offset: 1                 translation from center, 0 is center, 1 is on the circle, n can be used
  )
                          
  linear(                 - arrange elements in a line from the center to the edge
    min: 0,                   the offset of the first element from the center
    max: 1,                   the offset of the last element from the center (1 is the edge)
    scale: 1/n                apply to each child, n (number of children) can be used in any expressions
  )

functions:
  randomCharacter(set)    - random character from the given character set, used for text/circleText
  randomString(set, n)    - call randomCharacter from the given set n times, used for text/circleText
