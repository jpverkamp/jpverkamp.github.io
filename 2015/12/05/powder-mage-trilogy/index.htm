<p>The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/99602-powder-mage">Powder Mage trilogy</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6524620.Brian_McClellan">Brian McClellan</a> best fits in with the relatively uncommon (at least so far as I've seen) genre of flintlock fantasy. Basically, Revolutionary Era technology mixed with magic. It's actually pretty cool, especially when one of the major magic systems in the book revolves around the so called Powder Mages, who magically manipulate gunpowder. Honestly, I wish that was the only magic system in the world--I'd like to see that world.</p>
<p>On the negative end, there are a lot of characters to keep track of and some of the names are similar enough that it took entirely too long to remember who was who (Tamas and Taniel for one example). Eventually, I grew to the point where I couldn't actually pick which viewpoint I would have gotten rid of had it been a choice, but it made starting out rough.</p>
<p>On the positive end, the world feels fairly realistic and the action scenes are are pretty awesome (and there are a lot of them). Some of the descriptions get rather gruesome, but I think that serves to underscore just how dangerous the world is--and the magic systems in particular.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: When I first read Promise of Blood, I was reading it one chapter per day (discussing each over email as we went). Given the number of characters and initially disparate plot lines, this was probably not the best way to read this series. After reading the second two straight through in a single sitting or four, I actually went back and upped my rating for the first book. I almost want to go back and re-read it properly, but I doubt I'll do so.</p>
<p>Individual reviews (minor spoilers):</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790883-promise-of-blood"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/powder-mage-trilogy/1-promise-of-blood.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure what to think about this book.</p>
<p>On one hand, there are several varied magic systems in this book. You have the Privileged, the Marked, and the Knacked.</p>
<p>The Marked, also known as Powder Mages, are what I would have thought of as the core of the book, with the ability to basically control gun powder in various ways and to snort it as a drug, increasing their physical abilities. Side note though: It's weird that they're interchangeably called Marked and Powder Mages throughout the book. It took me more than a while to realize those two were the same thing.</p>
<p>The Privileged are more traditional fireball, lightning bolt sort of mages and, honestly, are more interesting. Which, for a series named after the Powder Mages, is a bit weird.</p>
<p>The Knacked are a fairly unique idea in that their magic is basically limited use super powers--the ability to go without sleep, for example, or a perfect memory. It's a neat idea, but I think it would be even better if it were the only magic system in the world. On top of the other two, it just seems ... busy.</p>
<p>So far as the actual story goes, you kick off the book with a bloody revolution: overthrowing and killing the king, along with much of the court, and all of the Privileged in the city. That's certainly a powerful start, and the rest of the book deals with the aftermath of such an event. I wish it had been a bit more focused though. The book jumps from scene to scene and viewpoint to viewpoint, sometimes skipping days or more in between. It's jarring and sometimes hard to follow.</p>
<p>Mostly related, I wish that there was a little more depth to the characters. You basically had Tamas the Angry, Taniel the Druggie, Adamat the Investigator, and Ka-poel the Voodoo Sidekick. I do like Adamat at least. Maybe the entire book should have been from his point of view? (Side note: Having Tamas and Taniel, both Powder Mages, be father and son was confusing. Their names are too similar. I kept getting them confused.)</p>
<p>And then the ending. So many things all come to a head all at once... and then it's over. A single shot and then we're in the Epilogue. It was surprising to say the least. I guess the sequels will deal with the fallout of those last few chapters, but honestly I'm not sure if this book caught me enough to convince me to read the sequels.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17608111-the-crimson-campaign"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/powder-mage-trilogy/2-crimson-campaign.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I think the main reason that I had some problems following all of the different storylines in the first Powder Mage book was that I was reading one chapter per day and discussion as I went. Reading straight through the second book helped keep everything together. It also helps that there are few to no new major characters.</p>
<p>Overall, this was very much the second book in a trilogy. It picks up where the first left off and sets up the third. It probably wouldn't stand particularly well alone, but then again it doesn't have to. It's pretty much action all of the way through, tying up various plot lines just to ramp things up even more.</p>
<p>The general world building continues to feel something like a kitchen sink, with at least four different fairly vague magic systems all interacting in odd ways. Ka-poel is even more a singleton that everyone (even the 'gods') underestimates. I'm still not sure exactly what she did to Taniel (if it was in fact her), but I am curious how that particularly bit will end.</p>
<p>I think Taniel had the strongest story of the book, growing and changing the most of any of the characters. He's still insufferable at times, but he's also interesting. Adamat got pushed to the edge and breaks things (and people) to get his family back. It's obvious, but it's still a solid storyline (and I'm glad it ended up as relatively well as it has for him).  Tamas' storyline behind enemy lines was interesting enough, but I want to see him back with the others again.</p>
<p>And ... cliffhangers. I cannot stop now, which is of course the point. But now I'm actually looking forward to what's next.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20883847-the-autumn-republic"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/powder-mage-trilogy/3-autumn-republic.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>A solid conclusion. Basically, The Autumn Republic builds on the world of the first two books, without really needing to introduce much in the way of new characters (with a few relatively minor exceptions) or new world building, instead taking everything to a final conclusion.</p>
<p>So far as the characters go, I really found myself rooting for the good guys and hoping they would save the day, even when they did some not entirely unobjectionable things. In particular, I'm glad that Adamat's story at least didn't get any worse and that he managed to survive (spoilers) all the crap that the Marked and Privileged put him through.</p>
<p>So far as the world building goes, I still think that there were too many different magic systems floating around (especially when you take into account various power levels), but I think we finally got a bit more insight into some of the inner workings at least of the powder mages and Privileged which was nice. I'm vaguely annoyed that we didn't get any more about Ka-Poel or Nila, given that this is the last in the series. So it goes.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, worth the read. McClellan goes on my list of authors to watch.</p>
<p>Next up, I'm going to step away from my <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a> for a moment, since I have a book club meeting coming up and instead read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15819028-the-golem-and-the-jinni">The Golem and the Jinni</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6466778.Helene_Wecker">Helene Wecker</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7163862-zoo-city">Zoo City</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/426034.Lauren_Beukes">Lauren Beukes</a>.</p>
<p>After that, I should be back on track for my final (planned) series of the year: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40853-necroscope">Necroscope</a> (15 books!).</p>
<p>Onwards!</p>
