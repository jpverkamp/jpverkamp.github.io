<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/49121-rama">Rama</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7779.Arthur_C_Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/65129.Gentry_Lee">Gentry Lee</a>.</p>
<p>I'm going to try something a little different this time. On previous series, I found it hard to write a blog post after reading several books back to back, I've been reviewing each book individual <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8261480-jp">on Goodreads</a> as I've read it. I have a short summary for the entire series, followed by the individual books. We'll see how it goes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Overall, I like the first book (the only by only <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7779.Arthur_C_Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, the rest were all co-authored by<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/65129.Gentry_Lee">Gentry Lee</a>). It's the kind of science fiction driven not particularly by plot or character, but rather by discovery and exploration. It's not always done well, but in this case I particularly enjoyed it. Conversely though, the other three in the series have much more focus on character conflict and to a lesser extent (but more than Rama) a central plot.</p>
<p>That change in style really turned me off the second book in the series, to the extent that I almost didn't finish the series. I'm glad I did though. Each of the sequels (in particularly the first part of #2 and most of #4) has some interesting ideas and solid extensions of Clarke's original world.</p>
<p>If you're into more interested in the science part of science fiction, you could do far worse than Rama. If, on the other hand, you want a story with more depth to the characters and plots, give Rama II a chance (although just keep in mind that Rama and Rama II are fairly different). If you are a completionist, the last book is actually pretty good and does a reasonably good job of tying up a lot of loose ends from the previous books.</p>
<p>Now, the individual reviews. Warning, there will be (usually minor) spoilers!</p>

<h3>Rama</h3>
<p>It's been a little while since I've read much science fiction, particularly any of the sort that Clarke is known for. Forget strong plot or characters and focus entirely around the big idea: In this case, the starship Rama is plenty large.</p>
<p>It starts off quickly, only a few chapters before you're on the ship. From there, you have situation after situation, describing how interesting the world that Clarke has built is and how the explorers react to it. The lack of a more specific antagonist becomes more of a problem towards then end, in that the book just sort of ends. There are various problems throughout the book, but no sense of building. I'm still not entirely sure how much I like this style.</p>
<p>Overall though, I think it's a cool world and I want to know more. Given that the sequels were written many years later and co-written by an author with a somewhat different style (based on the forward in Rama II), it will be interesting to see how different they are.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112520.Rama_II"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/06/21/rama/2-rama-ii.jpg" /></a></p>
<h3>Rama II</h3>
<p>This book feels rather different from Rendezvous with Rama.</p>
<p>For the first half, I wasn't sure that I actually liked the difference. Rather than the almost sterile science fiction that Clarke is better known for, the sequel deals a lot more with characters, drama, and to some extent matters of faith. It's especially interesting in how long it takes them to even get to Rama, especially compared to the first book.</p>
<p>Through the next quarter though, it really started picking up. I started to actually care about the characters and couldn't put it down. The feel of the ship, especially with some of the new findings, is just different enough that I wanted to know more.</p>
<p>At first, I wasn't sure that I was going to read the other two sequels. After this, I'm not sure how I couldn't.</p>

<h3>The Garden of Rama</h3>
<p>Like Rama #2, I went back and forth while reading this one on if I was actually enjoying it or if I would finish it at all. In the end, I did finish it and I think I'll even start the last one mostly out of a sense of completionism.</p>
<p>Essentially, there are five sections:</p>
<p>In the first, the three explorers from Rama II are leaving the solar system at high speeds. The parts where they are exploring the ship and learning how to live with the local 3D printer and interacting with other alien species is neat. The part where they decide that two men and a woman are enough to start a colony... That's just a little weird. I missed the first book, where the science and sense of exploration was the core of the story.</p>
<p>In the second, they get to a sort of routing section and finally meet an alien intelligence (even if it's still a robot). They (and by extension, we) get some neat answers. I liked this section for precisely the same reason I didn't like the first section: it's about exploring the world of Rama.</p>
<p>In the third, they go back to Earth, both in the context of the story and for a few scenes. They are all new characters and I cannot figure out why I care about any of them. Then they're sent off to a colony on Mars, except... surprise, they're actually going to make a new colony on the rebuilt Rama II. This is fine, but I feel like it could have been shortened.</p>
<p>In the fourth, the colony grows and thrives. Or not. Turns out people are people and people are terrible. Really, this whole section was depressing and not really what I was hoping to see in this book. I liked the smaller scales of the first 2.5 books. This not so much. Especially since it all ends up with exactly the sort of power struggle and corruption that I both see as entirely too plausible and hope isn't actually inevitable in such situations.</p>
<p>Finally, there's a big jump in the last ten percent or so where Robert goes to meet with the avian colony from the previous books. Suffice it to say, they have a strange lifecycle that we'd previously , which would have been much more interesting had Orson Scott Card not done it ~4 years earlier in Speaker for the Dead. It is exactly the sort of thing I wanted though, I just wish it had more relation to the rest of the story and had more than 10% of the pages. This is why I'm reading the 4th book, hoping there will be more of this.</p>

<h3>Rama Revealed</h3>
<p>In my opinion, this was by far the best of the sequels.</p>
<p>They start by doing exactly what I wanted out of the middle two books: getting away from the human settlement and into a situation where they are learning and experiencing something strange. In this case, they go to live among the octospiders, an intelligent civilization highly skilled in genetics and biological science who are completely deaf and only speak in color. It's a fascinating and nicely thought out situation and I did like it.</p>
<p>Even when, halfway through the book, the focus shifts back partially to the rest of the human colony in Rama, it still maintains a tight focus, with the bigger scale events going on behind the scenes. There was still a particular feel of exploring how different societies deal with issues (such as war: the octospiders view all war as terrible, not just certain kinds).</p>
<p>The final section, when the return to another Node felt a little strange. Either because it was rushed or because it felt sort of artificial. I didn't particularly mind though, since it still was working out echoes of events from all of the previous books and acted as a sufficient capstone to the series. I did think it was nice that Michael and Simone make another appearance, even if the latter replied her mother's odd fixation with a two person continuation of the species.</p>
<p>At the very end, the book veers somewhat towards a philosophical / religions tangent, which felt a little odd (the Ramas are essentially God) but still thought provoking.</p>
<p>Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this book. If you made it through the middle two books, you should probably read this one as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>Side note: I didn't finish Whitechapel Gods (which was actually next on my original <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a>) since, after 20%, I just really wasn't getting into it. There are some really interesting ideas (a steampunkification disease for example), but it was hard to get a grasp on exactly what was going on. So it goes.</p>
<p>Overall, that 47 of 100 books for the year, exactly on schedule. Next up: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/337048.The_Engines_of_God">The Engines of God</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/73812.Jack_McDevitt">Jack McDevitt</a>.
