<p>Next up on my <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/50764-laundry-files">The Laundry Files</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8794.Charles_Stross">Charles Stross</a>. Even though this wasn't originally on my list, I ended up just reading this rather than reading two series at once. So it goes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Basic premise: Cthulhian beasties live at the bottom of fractals. Higher mathematics is roughly equivalent to magic. Computers make math/magic far easier to perform.</p>
<p>It's a really cool premise and I'm glad that the series was recommended to me. I've greatly enjoyed following the exploits of Bob, computer programmer turned computational demonologist turned necromancer and his wife Mo: combat violinist.</p>
<p>Fair warning though: Stross takes tropes (such as computer programming, spy stuff, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software development)">scrum method</a>) and turns them up to 11. From time to time, the terminology gets a bit annoying (especially if you're not as familiar with the various fields he's writing about), but personally, I love it.</p>
<p>Now, the same as <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/06/21/rama">Rama</a>, my individual reviews as I read each book:</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101869.The_Atrocity_Archives"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/1-the-atrocity-archives.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>That... was intense.</p>
<p>To really get the most out of this book, I think you'd have to have a certain combination of things in your head: a knowledge of a lot of the more esoteric bits of computer science theory, physics, pop culture, and cosmic horrors. Pretty much right up my alley. Even then, I will admit to having no idea exactly where he was going with a few of those.</p>
<p>It's entirely possible that you'll still like it, even without the same base knowledge. It's still a quick enough read, with enough action to keep you turning the page, even if some of the technical info dumps are probably going to get skipped.</p>
<p>The last bit spent in the other world was fascinating. From a purely academic / world building standpoint, I would love to be able to see how such an alternate universe would deal with the sun going out and the air seeping away. How long would people survive? How would they deal with the beastie making it all happen?</p>
<p>After this, I am definitely going to read the rest of the Laundry Files.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14150.The_Jennifer_Morgue"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/2-the-jennifer-morgue.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This is an excellent follow up to The Atrocity Archives.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Stross managed to tone down the technobabble from ridiculous to only mildly over the top. There's still more than enough references to enjoy and enough neat world building on the (non Euclidean) edges between technology and demonology, but it's not quite hitting you over the head like the first one did.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what he gave up in technobabble, he replaced with spybabble. There are are strong hints of spy novel trappings all over the book. Let's just say though, they are there for a good reason.</p>
<p>One neat addition to this book (although I don't know if she'll be back) is the character of Ramona Random. (view spoiler) (which leads to some more distinctly R rated scenes than the first book had), but I thought she was a really interesting character. Despite--or perhaps because of--her rather problematic backstory, I really started to root for her throughout the book.</p>
<p>Also Mo. She's something of a badass now, taking on the bigwigs both in the Laundry and in the real world. Her violin is an especially interesting bit of world building. I especially love her part towards the end even if I'll admit that I didn't see the twist coming as soon as I could have. I do hope they do more with her in the latter books.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7149287-the-fuller-memorandum"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/3-the-fuller-memorandum.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>(Take 2, the internet ate my first review)</p>
<p>This is another solid entry in the Laundry Files and perhaps my favorite yet. We're really starting to get into some of the more horrific corners of the world. In particular, we learn a bit more about Mo's violin; we get another glimpse into a far flung world (view spoiler); and more about Angleton than I bet Bob ever wanted to know (and I really is explored more in the next books).</p>
<p>On the down side, Bob and Mo continue to have to do some fairly terrible things. There's some fallout from that in this book, but I feel like they just sort of skate by it without really dealing with what's going on. That's either going to come up in a later book or it's going to continue to get weirder when it doesn't.</p>
<p>The writing still pulls you along kicking and screaming. From the halfway point on, and in particular the ending, I couldn't put it down. There are more odd first/third person switches (Bob speaks in first person, everyone else is third person) and in particular a few chapters where I assume the intention is to hide exactly who is speaking. All together, it requires a bit more mental bandwidth to read than the previous two, but it's still worth it.</p>
<p>Looking forward, there are still two novels with Bob as the main character. There are a few things that I really want to see. Fingers crossed.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12393566-the-apocalypse-codex"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/4-the-apocalypse-codex.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The first chunk of this book was a little bit weak, in particularly the introduction of the new character Ms. Hazard. She represents a different style to the magic in this universe, which is interesting, but she just seems too good at her job. In the same manner as Superman, the more powerful someone becomes, the harder it is to make them interesting.</p>
<p>That does get better in the later half of the book, especially in the climax. I'm still not sure what to think about the mixed first/third person writing style, but it is interesting to see some of the scenes from two very different points of view. I miss Mo though.</p>
<p>So far as world building goes, Stross continues to build out the more interesting parts of the world, building towards an eventual apocalypse (or at least rather bad day). The visuals of the Sleeper and the Pyramid are still some of my favorite parts of these books, especially the idea that the wall from the previous books is designed to keep people out, not in. I hadn't gotten that impression before.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18211295-the-rhesus-chart"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/5-the-rhesus-chart.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Vampires don't exist.</p>
<p>Or at least that's what everyone in the Laundry believes. Turns out... there's a good reason for that.</p>
<p>From the perspective of someone in software development, the maddening extent at which the Scrum operates is amusing and all too close to home. After twisting first computer science and spy stuff into this world, it was neat to see the new topic.</p>
<p>My one real complaint with this book is that I think it's out of order. It's significantly smaller in scope than the previous two books where I was hoping for even more escalation towards CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN, rather than something somewhat more down to home. Although on the other hand, a few of the events in this book need the previous books to make sense. Still it's weird.</p>
<p>Now, sadly, I've finished the Bob focused Laundry Files novels released to date. So it goes. I look forward to the next.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23154785-the-annihilation-score"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/6-the-annihilation-score.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The Annihilation Score takes a bit of a different take from the previous five books, shifting the viewpoint from the previous hero* Bob to his wife Mo.</p>
<p>Previously, Mo had been one of my favorite characters in the series. She's just mysterious enough that she's interesting, coming in to save the day with a truly terrifying violin. Unfortunately, the more I know about her, the less I care.</p>
<p>The basic idea is interesting enough. Basically, as the world careens towards madness, magic is becoming more prevalent. But people don't believe in magic anymore, they believe in superheroes. One thing leads to another and Mo ends up leading a mostly publicly known super-hero task force. Much as The Rhesus Chart, despite the incoming danger, this feels like a de-escalation from the first four books.</p>
<p>One problem that annoyed me throughout the book was the relationship between Bob and Mo. I get it, they've been through Hell (literally) and they're each dealing with their own demons (again, literally), but I don't really understand their reactions to it. It feels more like Stross needed to get Bob out of the picture. So it goes.</p>
<p>Overall, I miss Bob. I miss Mo as a secondary character. I still enjoyed this more than enough to continue the series when the next comes out.</p>
<p>* For some definitions of hero.</p>
<hr />
<p>Amusingly, I haven't actually read that many ongoing series this year. If/when the next book comes out, I'll probably update this post.</p>
