<p>Next up on my <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/42777-the-academy">The Academy</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/73812.Jack_McDevitt">Jack McDevitt</a>.</p>
<p>The Academy (it feels weird to call it that) takes place in a few century distant future where humanity has been to the stars and found them next to empty. There are hints at civilizations that have come before (a monument on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_(moon)">Iapetus</a> for example) and others still around, albeit not at our same technological level. There are terrible threats: truly giant clouds of gas that seem to have a thing for destroying cities in several of the novels and a planet about to fall into a gas giant in another.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Overall, it's pretty solid science fiction. It's a little weird reading them all in sequence, since they only roughly seem to relate to one another. Sometimes characters are shared (superluminal pilot Priscilla "Hutch" Hutchins is one; reporter/editor Gregory MacAllister is another) and it's definitely a shared universe, but there are some events which come up in one book and not again for several sequels (if at all). It's not <em>bad</em> per say, just odd.</p>
<p>I do really like the world (galaxy?) that McDevitt has built here. I want to believe that life is far more common than he paints it--as a wise man once said, 'life finds a way'--but if that's not the case, I can imagine things working out exactly like this.</p>
<p>One particularly interesting point is that faster than light travel in this universe is possible, but limited. It still takes weeks / months / longer to get to other stars--which can be something of a problem if you happen to need rescuing. It's a perfect example though of just how <em>big</em> space is.</p>
<p>Also interesting (although I don't think I mention it in the individual reviews below) is the use of AI throughout the series. Each superluminal has an AI (although the Academy's seem to all be copies of a single AI named Bill) with a personality all its own. Yet they're just part of the world; for the most part people just interact with them as people. It's a neat idea and I like how it fits so seamlessly into the world.</p>
<p>That being said, here are my individual reviews:</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/337048.The_Engines_of_God"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/1-the-engines-of-god.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The Engines of God fits into the same rough style of science fiction as Rama, where the story is drive more by events and discovery than particularly by plot or character. In my opinion, this can be a perfectly enjoyable form of story, just so long as you know that's what you're getting.</p>
<p>The basic idea of this story is that in the future, humanity has developed faster than light travel and expanded to other solar systems. We've found one other current civilization (roughly WWI era; they haven't noticed us) and hints of others stretching back tens of thousands of years. Yet there's something strange: every one of them has sharp discontinuities where the clock of technology is reset.</p>
<p>One downside to this style and for this story in particular is that we only find out roughly what happened to those civilizations in the last 10% or so of the book. As an effect, the climax of the story felt rushed, with no earl impact. I know this is the first of a series and I can only hope they explore the impact of what they found a little more.</p>
<p>So far as characters, this was another weaker part of the story. I honestly don't think I could tell you anything about any of the characters I just read about (except maybe Hutch). Part of that is me--I'm not great with remembering details about people--and part is the same type-of-story thing mentioned above. Still, it's a little weird.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a neat story and in a style I enjoy reading (once I figured out that was what was going on). It was more than good enough to start in on the rest of the series. I really do want to figure out what is going on there.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/352780.Deepsix"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/2-deepsix.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Similar to the Engines of God a large chunk of the book is spent on the technology / archaeological aspects and how they interact with the story, but in this case there's also a strong thriller aspect. Things just keep going wrong (although, given that it's a novel, you can almost guess how each thing is going to go) over and over up until the climax.</p>
<p>The last section in particular was intense; I read the entire thing in one sitting--a literal page turner.</p>
<p>I liked the main characters well enough, at least as they were written. This time around, I could actually start to tell them apart, which is an upside. There are at least two who are curiously misogynistic for no reason that I could tell...</p>
<p>On a downside, we really didn't learn anything more about the Omega Waves from the previous book. And now we have some mysterious aliens who were about with advanced technology on a few thousand years ago... Perhaps we'll run into them in one of the sequels? One can hope.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382161.Chindi"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/3-chindi.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Chindi continues the trend of the previous two books in only vaguely being a sequel. It takes place after the previous two with one of the same characters (Hutch) and there are a few references to previous events... But that's about it. That's not a bad thing though.</p>
<p>This book starts with the discovery of an alien satellites around a neutron star. Hijinks ensue and people die (I'll come back to that in a second). It turns out that the satellites are part of a communication network. The next large chunk of the book follows our characters from world to world chasing after this network. (More people die). They finally end up finding a truly massive alien starship and exploring that (more people die). Then there's the climax where--just like Deepsix--our heroes have to attempt a daring / insane rescue mission so as not to leave a man behind.</p>
<p>On the plus side: I love the science aspects of the book. It's really starting to come together as a world and I like how there is some thought put into consequences. FTL travel and communication are possible, but it still takes time. Artificial gravity interacts oddly with inertia. Traveling at relativistic speeds does strange things to time. I keep turning pages, wanting to know more.</p>
<p>On the down side: It's getting increasingly hard to have sympathy for the characters. Over three books, there has been a fairly impressive body count. And almost all of them were avoidable. Over and over in this book, the author hangs a lampshade on the fact that what the characters are doing is dangerous. Off they go, and off someone dies. And yet other than a few token comments, no one seems to care. It's starting to get a bit weird.</p>
<p>Overall (and you can see by my rating), I'm still really enjoying this series. There's a definite sense of something building and the world growing and changing behind the scenes. And better, the epilogue of this book and the title of the next hint that we might just learn a bit more about the Omega Clouds from book 1! Looking forward to it.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/352781.Omega"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/4-omega.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Omega continues on in much the same vein as the previous Academy books. Science fiction in a universe where life is remarkably rare and civilization even more so. This time though... we've found someone.</p>
<p>The Omegas (clouds coming in 8000 year waves from the center of the galaxy which have a tendency to seek out and destroy right angles) return in the book, pointing directly to a new civilization. It's thousands of light years away, so there are only a limited number of ships that can possibly get there in time.</p>
<p>Hutch takes more of a backseat role this time, opening the stage to a few new characters. And just when I was finally getting to know her too. I like the new characters well enough and the death toll is at least lower this time. We'll see if they stick around in the next two books.</p>
<p>Overall, despite an entire civilization at stake, this book someone doesn't quite get as intense as those before it. Perhaps just because I've now read five of these in a row, but I can see from the outset which solutions are going to fail, which will partially succeed, and how they're finally going to save the day. It's not a problem per say, but it's getting there.</p>
<p>Final oddity (and this might have had some impact on the previous paragraph): I've actually read this book before. I'm fairly impressed that I managed to pick up and read the fourth in a series without realizing it (even if this is one series where that's not necessarily a problem) and that I didn't notice I was rereading until about 20% of the way into the book. It must have been pre-GoodReads that I last read it. Amusing.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/352775.Odyssey"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/5-odyssey.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Summary: The Academy is running out of money. In the meantime, MacAllister, a senator's daughter, a pilot, and a PR guy from the Academy are on a tour looking for UFOs because reasons. Eventually the find some (ish), the daughter gets contacted by aliens (maybe, no one believes her at first and it's never really explained), and a bunch of people die.</p>
<p>As with a few other books in this series, it takes half the book to get to what feels like the main plot point, with a massive acceleration in the last 15% and a final climax in the last 5%. It's not necessarily a bad thing, it just felt a lot more obvious in this book.</p>
<p>Especially when half the book it feels like is spent talking about how the Academy isn't getting funded any more (mirroring NASA and other modern day space programs) and an oddly large amount of the second half on a trial about a guy who went to a religious school, grew up, and punched a priest. I still haven't figured out where that came from.</p>
<p>That being said, I still enjoy the universe that McDevitt has built here. The universe actually feels big and the technology feels right. I want to believe that life will be more common than he paints it, but if it's not, this feels like how the universe might just be.</p>
<p>Once again, I hope the next book has a few more answers (we still don't know what the Omegas are and now there's a real current alien race?), but given the previous four and that #6 is the last book currently out... We'll see.</p>
<p>Edited to add: The book opens with a ship 'lost' in space because it didn't go nearly as far as it should have, despite the physicists saying that shouldn't be possible. Yet that particular weirdness is dropped and never mentioned again in favor of the 'retire the old ships because funding plot'. Weird.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/535318.Cauldron"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/6-cauldron.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Following from Omega, the Academy is basically dead (lack of funding / interest) and humanity is withdrawing from the stars. Then there's a breakthrough in new FTL drive technology orders of magnitude faster than the previous incarnations. Hutch returns as one of the two pilots sent out on a high speed mission to the origin of the Chindi, a world SETI received a transmission came from, a black hole, and the possible origin of the Omegas (finally).</p>
<p>On the upside: we finally got something in the way of answers for both where the Chindi and the Omegas came from. It's by no means a complete answer, but more than we've had thus far. I'll take it. The addition of the new drive technology promises to really shake things up. I hope this isn't the last book in the series--I want to see where this universe goes, now that you can fly to the galactic core in about four months... (As an aside, space is *huge*).</p>
<p>On a slight downside, some of the stops really felt undeveloped. What could have been an entire book earlier in the series was only a chapter or two. Even so, I think this book had the best flow of the six; I finished it in a day.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, solid science fiction. Compared to the two previous such series I've read this year, I'd put it well above <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/06/21/rama">Rama</a> (when taken as a whole) and just about even with <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2013/11/10/enders-game">Ender's Game</a>. That should give you a hint at how much I liked these books. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>
<p>Next up: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12899734-the-iron-wyrm-affair?from_search=true&search_version=service">The Iron Wyrm Affair</a>. It's got an intriguing cover and premise, but I'm a little worried that the reviews are all over the place. We'll see how it goes.</p>
