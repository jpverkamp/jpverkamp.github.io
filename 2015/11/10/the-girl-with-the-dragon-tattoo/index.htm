<p>And now for something a little different (for me): <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/44598-millennium-trilogy">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo / (The Millennium Trilogy)</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/706255.Stieg_Larsson">Stieg Larsson</a> (translated by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2565625.Reg_Keeland">Reg Keeland</a>). Almost all of my reading is science fiction or fantasy. The Millennium Trilogy is more of an investigative / thriller set more or less in the real world.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2429135.The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/10/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/1-with-the-dragon-tattoo.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>It's not that often any more that I finish a book in a day. That should tell you something about what I thought about the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Especially when it isn't fantasy. It isn't science fiction. It isn't horror (at least not the supernatural sort). Really, it's more of a investigation / thriller. Not a genre that I read that often.</p>
<p>Honestly, for the first half of the book, I wasn't sure that I was even going to finish it, let alone read the sequels. There were a few different story lines going on that I didn't really see how they fit together. Nothing overly much seemed to be happening. Then, around halfway through (when the main characters finally started to interact more), things really started moving. I read the rest of the book in one sitting.</p>
<p>It's certainly disturbing at times. It reminds me of Koontz style thrillers  (who's books I like, so that is a good thing) in shining a light into the darker corners of humanity--albeit without the supernatural angle Koontz usually has.</p>
<p>Then there's the rape scenes (Yes, that's probably a spoiler. But given the content, the fact that they're fairly well known, and that they don't end up having <i>that</i> large of an impact on the plot...).</p>
<p>They certainly bring another level of depth and pack a punch, but honestly I think the novel would be just as strong without them. There is plenty of other characterization for the characters involved and as mentioned, they don't seem to advance the plot. Honestly, I felt like they were included for the sake of including them, which is never particularly great writing, let alone for a rape scene.</p>
<p>That being said, it's an intense book. The second half drives to a powerful conclusion and there's a twist or two that I only saw coming in hindsight. I'm honestly surprised, but I'll definitely be moving on to the sequels.</p>
<p>Side note: There are points that you can tell this book was originally written in a different language. Some of the phrasing is odd along with parts of the setting (although that could have been done even in an English language novel). I don't think it detracted from the work, but it's something to keep in mind.</p>

<p>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo took a while to get into. It wasn't until Lisbeth and Blomkvist were finally in the same place perhaps halfway through the book that things really started moving.</p>
<p>The Girl Who Played with Fire is much the same.</p>
<p>Honestly, if I were to rate the first half of the book, I would give it three stars, maybe even two. There are just a lot of details that I just don't particularly care about. It's only halfway through, when Lisbeth stands accused of murder and various investigations are spinning once again out of control that the book starts getting good.</p>
<p>The second half? Five stars. I read it in one sitting. Things just keep getting more and more screwed up, with corruption and terrible people all over this place. I'll say that for Larsson. He can write terrible people.</p>
<p>One weird thing throughout is that there is entirely too much detail about mundane things. On several occasions you get essentially a stream of thought for everything that a character is doing... when they're really not doing anything interesting. Shopping, for example.</p>
<p>All together though, it's a strong book. Lisbeth has been through hell and emerged with a powerful combination of strength and brokenness. There are terrible people in the world, but they can be beaten. It's definitely the second of a trilogy, given that ending, and now I have to finish that. Hopefully, it doesn't take so long to speed up...</p>

<p>Given that Hornet's Nest kicks off immediately following the events of Played with Fire, I was hoping that it could keep up the momentum of the previous book and avoid the slow first half / crazy second half that the previous two books had suffered from. Unfortunately, no such luck. If anything, it takes even longer to get moving and the conclusion isn't quite as action packed as the previous novels.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I do feel like this was a solid conclusion to the series. It wrapped up a lot of loose ends that I hadn't even realized I was missing and finished character arcs, particularly for Lisbeth. She's still odd, but I'm really starting to understand where she comes from. And in the end, she wins. I would have been rather grumpy with the author (even if he is dead) had she not come out all right in the end.</p>
<p>One bit that I thought was odd was the subplot about Erika Berger changing jobs and being stalked. Just like the rape in the first book (which did turn out to have a much larger impact on the latter two books), I don't feel like it adds particularly much to the story. It does fit the theme about systematic corruption and victimization of women, but I feel like the story would have been just as strong without it.</p>
<p>As I've mentioned before, I don't read particularly much that's this close to the real world, but I did enjoy all three books in this series. Even though I would consider it the weakest of the three; if you've read the first two, you should read this one as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, it's hard to say that I actually 'liked' the books. They're certainly well written, although you can tell at times that they were written in Swedish and translated. But the subject matter is rough to read about, especially given that it's entirely possible for such things to be happening in the here and now. I do recommend at least the first though. It's something that people should read, if just for another perspective on life.</p>
<p>On another note, it's a little strange to know that you are reading a series published posthumously. I'm not sure if it actually would have changed how I read the stories or how I think about them had the author still been alive, but it is still something to think about.</p>
<p>Next up, back to science fiction: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/910863.Spin">Spin</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/27276.Robert_Charles_Wilson">Robert Charles Wilson</a>. The premise is that one night the stars went out and now time on the Earth is running roughly 100 million times slower than the rest of the universe. It's a really neat idea; I hope the execution is as good.</p>
