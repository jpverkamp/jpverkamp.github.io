<p>I think understanding this problem took longer than solving it. Originally, I thought that missing values should be treated as <code>float('inf')</code>, but they should just be ignored entirely:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>targets = {}
sues = collections.defaultdict(dict)

loading_targets = True
for line in sys.stdin:
    line = line.strip()

    if not line:
        loading_targets = False

    elif loading_targets:
        key, val = line.split(': ')
        targets[key] = int(val)

    else:
        sue, things = line.strip().split(': ', 1)
        for thing in things.split(', '):
            key, val = thing.split(': ')
            sues[sue][key] = int(val)

for sue in sues:
    valid = True

    for key in targets:
        if key in sues[sue] and sues[sue][key] != targets[key]:
            valid = False
            break

    if valid:
        print(sue)</code></pre>
<p>The longer half is correctly parsing and loading the data. For my case, I put both inputs in the same stream, separated by an empty line (similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a> and other protocols actually).</p>
<p>After that, it was just a matter of checking each Sue for the first existent but non-matching value.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Repeat the same algorithm, however assume that a Sue must have strictly more <code>cats</code> and <code>trees</code> than listed and strictly less <code>pomeranians</code> and <code>goldfish</code>.</p>
<p>For this, I introduced another <code>defaultdict</code> which contains the <code>comparators</code> to use for any given value:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>comparators = collections.defaultdict(lambda : operator.eq)
comparators['cats'] = comparators['trees'] = operator.gt
comparators['pomeranians'] = comparators['goldfish'] = operator.lt</code></pre>
<p>After that, we can change the <code>for sue in sues</code> loop to take the comparator into account:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>for sue in sues:
    valid = True

    for key in targets:
        if key in sues[sue] and not comparators[key](sues[sue][key], targets[key]):
                valid = False
                break

    if valid:
        print(sue)</code></pre>
<p>Neat.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Advent of Code: Day 15</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/15/advent-of-code-day-15" /><id>urn:uuid:cc3ed765-8159-4ad1-c41d-de1fae535ee2</id><updated>2015-12-15T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/15">Source</a></p>

<!--more-->
<p>The code is getting a bit longer, but a brute force solution still works great:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>try:
    TOTAL_QUANTITY = int(sys.argv[1])
except:
    print('Usage: cat input.txt | ./part-1.py [TOTAL_QUANTITY]')
    sys.exit(0)

ingredients = collections.defaultdict(lambda : collections.defaultdict(lambda : 0))
properties = set()

for line in sys.stdin:
    item, pairs = line.split(':')
    for pair in pairs.split(','):
        property, amount = pair.strip().split(' ')
        ingredients[item.lower()][property] = int(amount)
        properties.add(property)

items = list(sorted(ingredients.keys()))
properties.remove('calories')

def calculate_score(quantities):
    score = 1

    for property in properties:
        property_score = sum(
            quantities[item] * ingredients[item][property]
            for item in quantities
        )

        if property_score &gt; 0:
            score *= property_score

    return score

def splits(amount, count):
    if count &lt;= 1:
        yield [amount]
    else:
        for i in range(amount + 1):
            for subsplit in splits(amount - i, count - 1):
                yield [i] + subsplit

best_score = 0
best_quantities = None

for split in splits(TOTAL_QUANTITY, len(items)):
    quantities = dict(zip(items, split))
    score = calculate_score(quantities)

    if score &gt; best_score:
        best_score = score
        best_quantities = quantities

print(best_score)
print(best_quantities)]</code></pre>
<p>Essentially, there are four parts. First, we load all of the ingredients and their scores into memory. Then, <code>calculate_score</code> will take the logic described in the problem and return a score for any given quantities. Third, <code>splits</code> is a generator that will return all possible ways to divide <code>amount</code> items into <code>count</code> buckets:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>print(list(splits(5, 3)))
[[0, 0, 5],
 [0, 1, 4],
 [0, 2, 3],
 [0, 3, 2],
 [0, 4, 1],
 [0, 5, 0],
 [1, 0, 4],
 [1, 1, 3],
 [1, 2, 2],
 [1, 3, 1],
 [1, 4, 0],
 [2, 0, 3],
 [2, 1, 2],
 [2, 2, 1],
 [2, 3, 0],
 [3, 0, 2],
 [3, 1, 1],
 [3, 2, 0],
 [4, 0, 1],
 [4, 1, 0],
 [5, 0, 0]]</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we use all of those pieces to iterate over all of the possible scores. <code>dict(zip(items, split))</code> is a quick way to take two lists (of keys and values) and combine them into a dictionary.</p>
<p>I also tried to work out a solution using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithm</a>: <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/advent-of-code/blob/master/day-15/part-1-genetic.py">part-1-genetic.py</a>. It does work (in that it finds a pretty good solution), but the solution isn't optimal and it takes just as long as just brute forcing the problem. It's interesting though.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Do the same thing, only throw out any solutions that do not have a sum calorie count of exactly 500.</p>
<p>The tweak for this part is actually fairly elegant:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def calculate_score(quantities):
    ...

    calorie_count = sum(
        quantities[item] * ingredients[item]['calories']
        for item in quantities
    )
    if calorie_count != TOTAL_CALORIES:
        return float("-inf")

    ...</code></pre>
<p>Since we're looking for the largest score, returning a score that is infinitely low will skip over any invalid solutions. Other than that (and a new <code>try</code> block at the top), everything remains the same.</p>
<p>This was an interesting problem. Not quite as elegant a solution as I'd like, but it's still well within my self imposed (originally from Project Euler) 1 minute limit.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Advent of Code: Day 14</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/14/advent-of-code-day-14" /><id>urn:uuid:842a50a1-1a7f-6edb-ecb9-efaf989b031f</id><updated>2015-12-14T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/14">Source</a></p>

        data[key]['timer'] -= 1

print(max(
    (data[key]['distance'], key)
    for key in data
))</code></pre>
<p>Originally, I was going to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/priority_queue">priority queue</a> for this one. That would have let me put each next event (switching from running to resting or vice versa) in the queue and always pull off the next one to happen. Unfortunately, that made the code path right around stopping a bit complicated, since if one was running at the moment the race ends, they only update partially.</p>
<p>Instead, we just have a simulation that once per second will update the state (when <code>data[key]['timer'] == 0</code>), the distance (when )<code>not data[key]['resting']</code>), and the <code>timer</code>. Relatively straight forward. The one remaining amusing part is the ordering of the two <code>if</code> statements. If they're in the other order, you have an off-by-one problem where you should be running but have already changed state to <code>resting</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Run the same simulation, but after each round award one point to whoever is in first place (one to each in the case of ties). Determine who has the highest score.</p>
<p>For the most part, the code doesn't change. Basically, we're going to add one more field to each entry in <code>data</code>:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>data[name] = {
    ...
    'score': 0,
}</code></pre>
<p>Then we can use the same code that we had earlier to find the highest distance. Unfortunately, we cannot just increment that one because of ties; instead we have to loop:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>for tick in range(1, simulation_time + 1):
  ...

  max_distance, max_name = max((data[key]['distance'], key) for key in data)

  for key in data:
      if data[key]['distance'] == max_distance:
          data[key]['score'] += 1</code></pre>
<p>Then at the end, we print out the maximum <code>score</code> rather than <code>distance</code>.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Advent of Code: Day 13</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/13/advent-of-code-day-13" /><id>urn:uuid:3ba54996-2c7e-6568-0680-2a19a63ad1c0</id><updated>2015-12-13T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/13">Source</a></p>

<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> Given a list of seating preferences of the form <code>Alice would gain 54 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.</code> find the seating arrangement which maximizes total happiness.</p>
<!--more-->
<pre class="python"><code>happiness = collections.defaultdict(lambda : collections.defaultdict(lambda : 0))
for line in sys.stdin:
    self, gain_lose, amount, other = re.match(
        r'(\w+) would (gain|lose) (\d+) happiness units by sitting next to (\w+).',
        line
    ).groups()

    amount = int(amount)
    if gain_lose == 'lose':
        amount *= -1

    happiness[self][other] = amount

best_score, best_ordering = max(
    (
        sum(
            happiness[a][b] + happiness[b][a]
            for a, b in zip(ordering, ordering[1:] + (ordering[0],))
        ),
        ordering
    )
    for ordering in itertools.permutations(happiness.keys())
)

print(best_ordering)
print(best_score)</code></pre>
<p>I think I may have over functional'ed this one. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /> Basically, we parse everything first into a nested dictionary of happiness scores. Since we always have to add both directions in, it doesn't matter which is which in the indicies so long as it's consistent.</p>
<p>After that, we'll use the same trick as in <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/09/advent-of-code-day-9">Advent of Code: Day 9</a>: calculate pairs of scores and orderings and find the largest one. To specifically calculate the total score, we add the happiness in both directions for every pair of neighbors once again using <code>zip</code>. The only difference is that we add <code>(ordering[0],)</code> back onto the end so that we don't lose the first/last pairing of the list.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Add one more person <code>me</code>, who has a mutual happiness score of ±0 with every other person.</p>
<p>There's not actually terribly much different here, since the <code>happiness</code> structure already contains a default of 0 for any missing user. Because of that, we can just change this line:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>for ordering in itertools.permutations(happiness.keys())</code></pre>
<p>to this:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>for ordering in itertools.permutations(list(happiness.keys()) + ['me'])</code></pre>
<p>It takes a bit longer since the number of permutations grows rather quickly, but still not more than a few seconds total runtime.</p>

<p>It's a really interesting concept; something that I haven't quite seen anywhere else (The Golden Compass is vaguely similar, at least in the animal companions). And the world is just gritty and dark enough that it felt like a dark echo of what our world could be / have been. Unfortunately, a lot of details are left unclear. What exactly is the Undertow? How do people get which animals? What did the main character actually do to get her Sloth? How different are the animals from their wild brethren?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as interesting as the world building is, the plot isn't that great. I'll admit, I actually stopped paying as close attention to what was going on about halfway through. Then some more things happened and the story was over and unfortunately I didn't feel any particular urge to go back and figure out how we'd gotten from point B to point Z.</p>
<p>On top of that, I didn't particularly care for the main character. When you open the first few chapters by writing scam emails and stealing people's money, you know there's a bit of an ethical conundrum going on. A character like that can work perfectly well as a main character in a book, but at least for me, you have to work twice as hard for it. Zoo City didn't quite make it.</p>
<p>So it goes. It was interesting enough to read.</p>

Realizing that I don't have any particularly nice tools to work with streaming CSV data (although I did write about <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2012/10/04/querying-csv-files-with-sql">querying CSV files with SQL</a>), I decided to write one:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cat users.csv

"user_id","name","email","password"
"1","Luke Skywalker","luke@rebel-alliance.io","$2b$12$XQ1zDvl5PLS6g.K64H27xewPQMnkELa3LvzFSyay8p9kz0XXHVOFq"
"2","Han Solo","han@rebel-alliance.io","$2b$12$eKJGP.tt9u77PeXgMMFmlOyFWSuRZBUZLvmzuLlrum3vWPoRYgr92"

$ cat users.csv | csv2json | jq '.'

<p>Luckily, Python has nice CSV and JSON libraries built in:</p>
<pre class="python"><code># If --parse is set, try to parse each entry as json
def parse(thing):
    try:
        return json.loads(thing)
    except:
        return thing

# Assume that headers are the first row
reader = csv.reader(sys.stdin)
headers = None
for row in reader:
    if not headers:
        headers = row
        continue

    if '--parse' in sys.argv:
        row = [parse(thing) for thing in row]

    # Recombine the headers with each row (no one said this was saving space)
    row = dict(zip(headers, row))
    print(json.dumps(row, default = str))</code></pre>
<p>Basically, assume that the first row of the CSV data is headers (converting to a JSON dict doesn't make much sense if it isn't) and then combine that with each additional row to write out a dictionary. In addition, I put a bit of code in there to assume that you might be storing JSON in your CSV fields. If so, you can <code>--parse</code> the data automagically:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cat users-with-preferences.csv | csv2json --parse | jq '.'

{
  "preferences": {
    "force-user": true
  },
  "name": "Luke Skywalker",
  "user_id": 1,
  "password": "$2b$12$XQ1zDvl5PLS6g.K64H27xewPQMnkELa3LvzFSyay8p9kz0XXHVOFq",
  "email": "luke@rebel-alliance.io"
}
{
  "preferences": {
    "ship": "Millennium Falcon"
  },
  "name": "Han Solo",
  "user_id": 2,
  "password": "$2b$12$eKJGP.tt9u77PeXgMMFmlOyFWSuRZBUZLvmzuLlrum3vWPoRYgr92",
  "email": "han@rebel-alliance.io"
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>user_id</code>s are actually numbers, the <code>preferences</code> field has been unpacked, and Luke's <code>force-user</code> status is a boolean. It's neat how you get all of that more or less for free.</p>
<p>Also, have I mentioned how nice <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> is for working with JSON?</p>
<p>And that's it.

<p>This is pretty similar to <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/advent-of-code-day-5">Advent of Code: Day 5</a>, although it cannot <em>quite</em> be done with purely regular expressions.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def is_valid(password):
    numeric = list(map(ord, password))

    return (
        # Include an increasing subsequence
        any(
            numeric[i] + 2 == numeric[i + 1] + 1 == numeric[i + 2]
            for i in range(len(password) - 2)
        )
        # May not contain i, o, or l
        and not any(c in password for c in 'iol')
        # Must have at least two different pairs
        and len(set(re.findall(r'(.)\1', password))) &gt;= 2
    )

def increment(password):
    numeric = list(map(ord, password))
    index = -1

    while True:
        numeric[index] += 1
        if numeric[index] &lt;= ord('z'):
            break
        else:
            numeric[index] = ord('a')
            index -= 1

    return ''.join(map(chr, numeric))

def next_valid(password):
    while True:
        password = increment(password)
        if is_valid(password):
            return password

print(next_valid(sys.argv[1]))</code></pre>
<p>Basically, there are two interesting problems: finding out if a string <code>is_valid</code> and <code>increment</code>ing one to the next value.</p>
<p>For the first, we check each of the three cases in order. We can tell if there is an ascending sequence by first converting to numeric values (<code>ord</code> will return the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unicode_codepoint">unicode codepoint</a> for a character) the comparing three adjacent values. The second test just checks if <code>any</code> character is <code>in</code> the string. The last actually does use regular expressions again to find all pairs of letters; then, by converting them into a set removes duplicates and counts unique values.</p>
<p>For the second problem (<code>increment</code>), we use the numeric form again and start at the end of the string. We'll increment each character working back towards the front of the string, stopping as soon as we don't have to carry. Then, we convert the password back into a string using the inverse of <code>ord</code>: <code>chr</code>.</p>
<p>And, that's it. It's certainly not the most efficient code, but it still takes only a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Find the next string matching the same rules after the one you found in part 1.</p>
<p>Just run the same program again on the first one's input.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Advent of Code: Day 10</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/10/advent-of-code-day-10" /><id>urn:uuid:f36a3b14-d73a-1afd-d434-17fee29644cf</id><updated>2015-12-10T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/10">Source</a></p>

<pre class="python"><code>def look_and_say(seq):
    result = ''
    index = 0
    count = 0

<p>I've already gone into far more detail on <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2014/09/15/look-and-say">Look and Say</a> sequences before. But this time, we're doing it iteratively in Python! Basically, we just maintain a bit of state for which character we are currently counting. When we change, output; otherwise, incrememnt the change.</p>
<p>There are some interesting tricks you could do with regular expressions, but I doubt you can find something faster or much more elegant than this.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Repeat 50 times.</p>
<p>There's nothing particular interesting about this one. I've already accounted for this by passing in the second paramter on the command line.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>The Golem and the Jinni</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/09/the-golem-and-the-jinni" /><id>urn:uuid:d2df3156-7c90-f14f-07ba-4585dc7ef17e</id><updated>2015-12-09T23:55:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15819028-the-golem-and-the-jinni"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/09/the-golem-and-the-jinni/the-golem-and-the-jinni.jpg" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15819028-the-golem-and-the-jinni">The Golem and the Jinni</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6466778.Helene_Wecker">Helene Wecker</a> follows two parallel stories: that of a Golem and a Jinni (of course), each finding their way from fall flung shores to circa 1900 New York City.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's a relatively complex narrative structure, jumping from the Golem to the Jinni and even to a few minor characters within the space of a chapter. Even in one viewpoint, there are multiple timelines, showing how events a thousand years apart all fit together. Yet despite all of this, I never got lost, never couldn't figure out where I was in the story. It took a while for the story lines to start coming together (for a while, it felt like reading two books), but once they do things just keep pushing towards the conclusion.</p>
<p>Two things in particular I enjoyed about the story were the characters and the magic. The Golem and the Jinni have very different personalities, down to the very core of the sorts of beings they are. There is some commentary about the idea of an unchanging nature and choosing your own fate which I particularly enjoyed. I really felt for both of them by the end of the book and could see why they made the choices they made (even if they didn't make any logical sense).</p>
<p>The magic of the world was also neat. It's fascinating to see the magic of real world traditions. I honestly don't know how much of it was 'real' and how much embellished, but it all stayed just close enough to reality that I could see such things happening just like that in a close cousin of our own world.</p>
<p>Overall, this is one of the best books I've read this year. I'm glad my book club choose it, otherwise it might have been a while before I got around to it.</p>
<p>Side note: It looks like there may be <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27234491-the-iron-season">a sequel</a> in the works? Tentative release date in 2018 though... So it goes.</p>
<hr />
<p>One more book club offshoot before I get back to my original reading list: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7163862-zoo-city">Zoo City</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/426034.Lauren_Beukes">Lauren Beukes</a>. If it's anywhere near as good as The Golem and the Jinni, I cannot wait.</p>]]></content></entry></feed>
