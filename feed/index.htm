<p>Series number five: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/45135-alpha-omega">Alpha &amp; Omega</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/40563.Patricia_Briggs">Patricia Briggs</a>.</p>
<p>It's not that often I actually read two books/series in the same genre back to back. But after <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/02/20/the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a> last time and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/54966-white-trash-zombie">White Trash Zombie</a> up next, we've got something of an interesting contrast.</p>

<p>Back to Alpha &amp; Omega. I'd previously read the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40932-mercy-thompson">Mercy Thompson</a> series, set in the same universe. It is a really interesting world in which a subset of the supernatural critters (only the fae at the start of the series) are 'out' in the public consciousness. Since the story is told from the perspective of various supernaturals and takes place primarily in their world, Briggs manages to avoid some of the problems that would come with such a revelation.</p>
<p>After reading both Alpha &amp; Omega and Mercy Thompson, I'm really hard pressed to say which series I like more. There's a certain familiarity and depth to Mercy, being the older (for me) and longer series, but Alpha &amp; Omega is the new shiny. It's nice to see a contrast between the mostly outsider perspective into the lives of werewolves that Mercy brings versus a wolf's look from Anna.</p>
<p>The fantastic elements to this story are well thought out, with a particularly interesting amount of attention paid to the relative dominance of werewolves and how that influences their ranks within the pack. Although it turns out that the original studies about alpha wolves aren't actually that great<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>, it's still an interesting aspect for the story.</p>
<p>In addition to the wolves, you get the normal rogues gallery common in most urban fantasy. It turns out every story about things that go bump in the night is true. Vampires? Fae? Witches? Present and accounted for. It was particularly interesting reading the last book in Alpha &amp; Omega after reading <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/02/20/the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40346-the-dresden-files">The Dresden Files</a>. There's a bit more influence from / reference to Navajo myths and it's interesting to see how each series does it differently.</p>
<p>One note, for better or for worse. Alpha &amp; Omega deals a lot more with themes of helplessness and rape (although Mercy had some as well). It was at times uncomfortable even for me; I can't really imagine how it would read to someone that had to live through such things.</p>
<p>Overall, Alpha &amp; Omega is an excellent series, easily my favorite out of the ones I've read thus far this year. I still couldn't say if I would recommend it over Mercy Thompson or vice versa. Honestly, if you have the time, read both. The timelines are intermixed (with some mostly small references between them), so you could even read alternating books.</p>
<p>So far this year, that puts me at 24 books out of 100 after two and a half months. I've fallen behind a bit (only 5 books ahead of schedule instead of 7), but still well on my way.</p>

<p>One problem with gifs is that they tend to be somewhat sizable. To keep that at least a little under control, I've added a quick script to my <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/programming/by-topic/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> to trim all files passed on the command line to a maximum edge size of 256 pixels:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>#!/bin/bash

tmpdir=&lt;code&gt;mktemp -d /tmp/shrink-gifs.XXXX&lt;/code&gt;
echo "$tmpdir"

for file in "$@"
do
  echo "$file"
  convert "$file" -alpha on -channel rgba -coalesce -resize 256x256 -layers OptimizeFrame -colors 64 "$tmpdir/$file"
  mv "$tmpdir/$file" "$file"
done</code></pre>
<p>Basically, I'm using the excellent <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> software, specifically the <code>convert</code> utility. All of those flags are necessary since gifs have layers. This results in both a properly converted gif but also a somewhat optimized palette.</p>
<p>Also, we're using a temporary directory rather than using the in place version of <code>convert</code>: <code>mogrify</code>. For whatever reason, <code>mogrify</code> doesn't seem to work on gifs. So it goes.</p>
<p>As a side note, <code>identify</code> (another tool that comes with ImageMagick) is really useful. Give it an image and it will tell you how large it is, all on the command line.</p>

<p>To that end, here is <code>ts</code>, a tool for adding timestamps to each line of <code>stdin</code>:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
import time

def stamp(line):

    sys.stdout.flush()

stamp('--- &lt;ts&gt; ---')

for line in sys.stdin:
    stamp(line)

stamp('--- &lt;/ts&gt; ---')</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ python long-running-script.py | ts

[2015-02-25 17:05:35] --- &lt;ts&gt; ---
[2015-02-25 17:05:35] things

<p>On to my fourth series this year: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/52837-the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4414255.Kevin_Hearne">Kevin Hearne</a>.</p>
<p>First, let's start with the good parts:</p>
<p>I really like urban fantasy series and this is a fairly prototypical example there of. It's always interesting to see how an author marries the real world with various mythologies. In particular, this series forcuses on Irish mythology, which is something that I haven't really had that much experience with.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Another thing I liked is how many/all of various religious figures are represented. It gets a little crazy at times, seeing how various aspects of all the different world religious figures are all all out and about but it's fun to see them interact. I was particularly amused when Mary (yup, that Mary) showed up. That's not something I've often seen.</p>
<p>Finally, the books are really funny. Some of the humor was more than a little crude. I particularly enjoyed a lot of the mental back and forth between Atticus and his hound. While I agree with a lot of other reviews I've read about the series in that the latter doesn't actually feel like a dog, but that's not really the point. The point is that he's funny. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>
<p>Okay, now the less than great parts:</p>
<p>Atticus is supposed to be 2,100 years old. He really doesn't feel it. He claims that he's gotten very good at fitting in with modern young adults, but there's never really a sense of age or weight to him. He comments on all manner of events that he's been involved in, but there's really nothing to it other than those slight mentions.</p>
<p>How in the world have none of the mortal gods died by the beginning of the series? In the very first book, it becomes all too obvious that gods can be killed. But we're supposed to believe that pretty much all of them have survived for millenia until Atticus happens to come around? All righty then.</p>
<p>There is a tendency towards a male fantasy centric / sexist view, especially in the earlier books. I'd be willing to be that the author got more than a few reviews and comments about this and it is toned down somewhat by the latter books. Still, the idea of random goddesses and other woman seemingly ranodmly falling for the main character and the sidekick dog's obsession with poodles are offputting.</p>
<p>All that being said, there's an obvious comparison (at least in my mind) between this series and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40346-the-dresden-files">The Dresden Files</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10746.Jim_Butcher">Jim Butcher</a>. They are both urban fantasy series with a male-fantasy-powerful male protagonist; they both rely heavily on a quick moving snarky sense of humor. Iron Druid starts out at a higher level, although the latter Dresden Books do catch up rather well. All together, if you're only going to read one of them read The Dresden Files. But if you run out of Dresden Files, you could do worse than The Iron Druid Chronicles.</p>
<p>So far this year, that puts me at 20 books out of 100 after 51 days; 7 books ahead of schedule. I guess that's another indicator for how much I wanted to keep reading the Iron Druid Chronicles.</p>

<p>The man on the other side of the table blinked. That was all the more reaction he showed, but it was more than I had seen since he'd entered the building.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The job?"</p>
<p>Mentally, I shook my head. Of course he'd come for the job. That wasn't the point. The entire thing was something of a test.</p>
<p>"It's a bit of a long way to go for work."</p>
<p>Based on his robe and rope belt, I had a sneaking suspicion that he was from some religious order or another. It seemed unlikely that he was looking for a new job, so there had to be something else there.</p>
<p>He just nodded.</p>
<p>Perhaps a different tack.</p>
<p>"You know what the job will entail?"</p>
<p>He nodded again.</p>
<p>I paused a moment, but when he remained silent I prompted, "care to elaborate?"</p>
<p>"I'm here to step through a hole in the end of the world."</p>
<p>It was an oddly poetic answer. But then again, if he actually were a man of the cloth it made some manner of sense. A lifetime devoted to the study of one holy text or another would do that to you.</p>
<p>The next was the most important question of the interview. Given the ... unique situation I found myself in...</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>He studied me for a long moment before answering. *Good* I thought. That was good.</p>
<p>"Because He is calling to me."</p>
<p>I swear I could hear the capital in his voice. Not entirely sure that I even wanted to know the answer, I asked the obvious question.</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"He-Who-Waits" His eyes had grown wide and almost warm, although how such an adjective could be applied to one's eyes, I couldn't quite describe. "He-Who-Lives-Beyond"</p>
<p>"And this 'He-Who-Waits'," I asked, "what will you do if you find him?</p>
<p>A shake of his head and a smile was all the answer I got. No matter how I rephrased the question, he refused to answer.</p>
<p>If it had been up to me, that right there would have been enough to remove him from the pool of applicants, small as it was. Unfortunately though, for me as much as for them, it wasn't up to be.</p>
<p>And the powers that be had been very clear.</p>
<p>Madness was *not* to be considered a deal breaker.</p>
<hr />
<p>The second and third candidates for the position came in together, holding hands in fact.</p>
<p>The first woman was tall and thin, with a veritable name of unruly red hair drawing attention onwards and upwards. I could have sworn I saw twigs tangled throughout and--stranger yet--what appeared to be a potted tree sticking out of one over large pocket.</p>
<p>The second seemed as tied to get machines as the first was to nature. She walked with an odd gate, every second step taking longer than the one before, swinging outwards with a dull thump unlike a footfall had any right to sound.</p>
<p>They took their seats as one, not letting go of one another even as they did, instead scooting the chairs ever closer, just so they could reach without a strain.</p>
<p>"Hi!" the first woman exclaimed. I don't believe I've ever before or since heard a voice better matching the description of sunshine. "I'm Flora."</p>
<p>"Cogs." The other woman's reply wasn't rude, strictly speaking, just on the very edge of curt.</p>
<p>And those names...</p>
<p>Based on the nature of our work--and the position we were attempting to fill in particular--we had suggested, né required that applicants not use their real names. Names have power, and if there's one thing the Others don't need, it's more power over us mere mortals.</p>
<p>Still, they could at least have tried to make up slightly less unusual names.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>"Why?" I asked. Despite their nom de choice, the two women were among the best candidates I'd had yet. Truth be told, given how far we were from even the fringes of civilization, it was a miracle that we had choices at all.</p>
<p>To my surprise, Cogs was the first to answer. Up until now, Flora had been taking point, with her friend only chiming in for the few questions with a more mechanical gent.</p>
<p>"They say the rules are different there. Machines don't work. Physics is less rigid. Navigation isn't always reliable."</p>
<p>I nodded to each point. That was often among the more difficult aspect for applicants to wrap their heads around. The rules we'd all grown up with just didn't work on the other side of the portal. To most, it was disorientating, sickening even. To some--like Cogs apparently--it was intriguing.</p>
<p>"And you?" I turned to Flora.</p>
<p>"Isn't it obvious?" Her voice was low, lilting. "I want to be the first to find Otherlife."</p>
<p>I blinked at her. It wasn't the first time I'd heard the idea--the monk had seemed to think there'd be life there at least. But thus far, the other side had been entirely sterile. The only life was what we brought with us, even if it did tend to go... strange, given enough time.</p>
<p>"And if you find it," I asked, "what then?" I was sure my employers wouldn't actually care about that particular question, but I was actually a little curious myself.</p>
<p>She waited a moment before answering, watching me closely. I had the feeling she was weighing me, judging me. As if I were the interviewee, rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>"We've already screwed up this world," she finally said with a nod. "I want to find a world where we can do better. I want to give life a chance."</p>
<p>That sounded like just the right sort of crazy to me. Ultimately it would be up to the powers that were to choose whether or not the lair of them were chosen. I thought they had a chance though.</p>
<hr />
<p>The final interview candidate looked a little bit off even as he walked through the door. It wasn't until he sat down and looked right at me that I could begin to figure out why though.</p>
<p>The first thing that jumped out at me was the eyes. Pale blue, so pale they were almost white. I hadn't seen anyone with eyes that color before. And the pupils. They weren't entirely... Round. Slightly oblong, although without another pair of eyes to compare too, I couldn't say for certain how different they were.</p>
<p>After a sufficiently long pause where I was sure he was beginning to wonder if perhaps he had somehow miraculously come to the wrong place, I finally greeted him. "Good morning."</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>That was when I got the second surprise--his teeth were ground each to a fine point, overlapping I'm a saw tooth pattern. And it wasn't just that, it couldn't be. To have been ground like that, they couldn't have started out at a normal human size. They had to have been several times that to begin with.</p>
<p>"Good morning," he intoned. Third surprise: his voice was unusually high, edging well into the range of an alto. And neither was a single harmonic, as voices tended towards, but rather a complex layering, a choir all in one.</p>
<p>What <em>was</em> this man?</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>"So tell me," I asked. "Why do you want the job?" Although the strangeness kept mounting, I still couldn't quite figure out what the man was. I had seen all manner of strange men and women in my travels, but nothing quite like this. It was almost like he didn't quite fit together.</p>
<p>The man answered almost immediately, that layered voice every bit as intriguing as the first I had heard it. I don't think I would ever tire of listening to him. "New parts."</p>
<p>I blinked.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>He smiled. It wasn't a jovial smile, but rather a predatory one. His eyes glinted, that pale blue catching the light.</p>
<p>He raised his hand, turning it slowly, watching it as he did.</p>
<p>It took me a moment, but eventually I noticed. Running along the back of each finger, right where the tendons would have been was a thin spoke of what looked like bone. I thought at first that he was wearing some sort of glove, but it moved too smoothly, pulling against the skin in too natural a way.</p>
<p>It was part of his hand.</p>
<p>The hand. They eyes. The legs.</p>
<p>This wasn't a single man, this was a patchwork. A mix of who knew how many different organisms.</p>
<p>That predatory glint in his eyes? For all I knew, they were actually a predator's eyes.</p>
<p>This was something I hadn't ever heard of before. Some sort of magic? Whether or not the powers in charge of the expedition wanted him, I was going to have to keep an eye on this one.</p>
<hr />
<p>Why do I want to go? Is that your question?</p>
<p>Well, everyone is looking for something. Be it an alien god or a new set of rules for reality, there's always something.</p>
<p>But me? I study people. That's the reason you hired me in the first place, isn't it? Because I can see how people think, and because it fascinates me to do so.</p>
<p>Well I really want to see what happens to long term explorers in this Otherspace. To date, we've only sent out small trips, a day or two at most.</p>
<p>Even in those, there were changes. Small neurosis, changes so slight you wouldn't even notice them if you weren't watching carefully.</p>
<p>Me, I've been watching carefully.</p>
<p>What will happen if you take a group through for weeks, even months at a time? I don't know. No one does. Well, except maybe He-Who-Waits. You'll have to take that up with the monk though.</p>
<p>But I do know one thing for certain.  I can't wait to find out.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>update-dotfiles encryption</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/02/11/update-dotfiles-encryption" /><id>urn:uuid:da93efa1-4aa3-e880-6082-ac2b0647ffa5</id><updated>2015-02-11T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I do like having my <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/programming/by-topic/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> on GitHub.

For one, it means that they're always available when I set up a new machine. For two, others can see them and take whatever is interesting for their own dotfiles. But all that has a disadvantage: what if I want to store my SSH configs?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Technically, they're not secret. I don't have my actual SSH keys in there. But I do have some names of machines and at least not having those on the GitHub means that the spiders trolling the repos have at least one more step before finding them. Especially those running on non-standard ports.</p>
<p>To that end, here's a quick script to AES encrypt / decrypt files with Python.</p>
<p>First, we want something that can turn any password into an AES key. Since they have to be an exact number of bits a hashing function works particularly well here:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def get_key():
    if 'AESKEY' in os.environ:
        key = os.environ['AESKEY']
    else:
        key = getpass.getpass('AES passphrase: ')

    return hashlib.sha256(key.encode('utf-8')).digest()</code></pre>
<p>(Yes, I should be using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-Based_Key Derivation Function">Password-Based Key Derivation Function</a>. So it goes.)</p>
<p>Next, the encryption function. We need to set up a random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/initialization_vector">initialization vector</a>.</p>
<p>Then, since the file might not be evenly divisible into blocks, we'll need to pad it. Since we want this to be able to deal with binary or other files, there's no guarantee that we can tell when a file has ended. So we'll use the <code>struct</code> library to store the file length as well. Given that we're storing the size as a 64-bit integer, we'll be able to store files up to 18.56 exabytes. Yeah, I think we'll be fine for a while.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to add a hash so we can verify that the file was not tampered with via <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/202/should-we-mac-then-encrypt-or-encrypt-then-mac">encrypt-then-MAC</a>. All together:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def encrypt(file):

    key = get_key()

    iv = os.urandom(16)
    encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV = iv)

    with open(file, 'rb') as fin:
        content = fin.read()

    # Store the original file size as uint64 and pad to 16 bytes
    content = struct.pack('&gt;Q', len(content)) + content
    content = content + (b'\0' * (16 - len(content) % 16))

    content = encryptor.encrypt(content)
    hash = hashlib.sha256(content).digest()

    content = base64.b64encode(iv + hash + content)

    outfile = file + '.aes'
    with open(outfile, 'wb') as fout:
        fout.write(content)</code></pre>
<p>Straight forward.</p>
<p>Likewise, decryption pulls apart the parts of the file, checks the integrity with the hash, then decrypts:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def decrypt(file):

    key = get_key()

    with open(file, 'r') as fin:
        content = fin.read()

    content = base64.b64decode(content)
    if len(content) &lt; 32:
        print('Malformed content: not enough data')
        sys.exit(1)

    iv = content[:16]
    hash = content[16:48]
    content = content[48:]

    if hash != hashlib.sha256(content).digest():
        print('Failed hash check')
        sys.exit(1)

    decryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV = iv)
    content = decryptor.decrypt(content)

    fileSize = struct.unpack('&gt;Q', content[:8])[0]
    content = content[8:fileSize+8]

    outfile = file[:-4]
    with open(outfile, 'wb') as fout:
        fout.write(content)</code></pre>
<p>Shiny. Now let's tweak the script that updates dotfiles to handle encrypted files:</p>
<p>Basically, the only code that changes is if the user choose <code>y</code> to replace a file. If that file ends with <code>.aes</code>, ask for the password and try to decrypt it.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>...

# If the file is encrypted, decrypt it
if path.endswith('.aes'):
    try:
        if not aes:
            aes = imp.load_source('aes', os.path.expanduser('~/.bin/aes'))

        if aes:
            print('{0} decrypting'.format(path))
            aes.decrypt(path)
            shutil.copymode(path, path[:-4])
            path = path[:-4]
    except:
        print('{0} cannot decrypt, aes does not exist'.format(path))

...</code></pre>
<p>One caveat is that since the <code>aes</code> library is stored without the <code>py</code> suffix, we load it dynamically with the <code>imp</code> module. I love how that's possible (even easy) in Python.</p>
<p>And that's about it. I've moved my SSH configs over and vastly expended them with a number of servers that I work with on a daily basis. Also there's another level which allows for different environments (work or home) and operating systems (to deal with different keyboard standards).</p>
<p>Very cool.</p>
