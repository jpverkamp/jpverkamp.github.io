<p>I find it vaguely amusing how relatively many zombie series I've read this year. <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/27/white-trash-zombie">White Trash Zombie</a> (with the next October 6th!). <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/03/31/precinct-13">Precinct 13</a>. <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/18/elantris">Elantris</a> (Yeah--that doesn't really count.) Still, the more the merrier when you're hungry for flesh.</p>
<p>Overall, Newsflesh is an excellent series. Basically, in the future, zombies are here and bloggers have taken over the world. Where these stories really shine is their world building. The zombie plague is an infectious disease and society has changed as a result. It actually feels like something that could just happen, which really helped to draw me into the books.</p>
<p>Also positive, there are a goodly number of plot twists throughout the series. Some are obvious in hindsight, some even in foresight. And some... Ow. Some hit right where it hurts.</p>
<p>Here are my individual reviews. Warning: <strong>spoilers</strong>. Each book's review should be relatively spoiler-free, but it's hard to talk about Deadline and Blackout without spoilers for Feed.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7094569-feed"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/30/newsflesh-trilogy/1-feed.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Feed follows the story of George (yup), Shaun (also yup), and Buffy (not even kidding), three bloggers covering the story of a lifetime: a Republican Presidential candidate. Then, as it always goes in a zombie story, things go wrong.</p>
<p>I liked the characters. The bloggers are divided into a newsie (tells it like it is), an Irwin (basically the action stars of the blogging world) (yup), and a fictional (writes poetry); missing only a Stewart (satire in the news) (also yup). I really felt for all of them, even if at time they tended a bit towards caricatures of their roles. Also: evil bad guy is evil and obvious, but sometimes that's not a bad thing.</p>
<p>This is also one of the best treatments of a 'realistic' zombie outbreak that I think I've read. Society has mostly adapted to everyone being a carrier with a system of restrictions (no one can go to Yosemite) and near constant blood tests. The CDC is far more powerful and people have adapted to the idea that any mammal over 40 pounds could be your death.</p>
<p>Therein lies the first oddity with this book: Feed doesn't actually feel like a zombie novel. More than anything it feels like a novel about journalism, politics, and freedom of speech... which just so happens to happen during after the zombie apocalypse. It took me a while to realize this, but I think it makes the novel stronger as a result.</p>
<p>And then there's the twists, oh the twists. I get it, it's a zombie story. People are going to die. Just... I didn't see that coming... Wow. That's certainly one way to get me to read the sequel.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8429687-deadline"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/30/newsflesh-trilogy/2-deadline.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I was curious to see where Grant would take this, after killing off a small pile of main characters in the first book. It turns out: somewhere right between what I expected and what I didn't expect at all.</p>
<p>On one hand, Shaun is crazy now. He hears George's voice in his head and answers her out loud. Everyone around him of course thinks he's crazy, but they mostly seem to give him space. I'm not sure what I think about that. Shaun is still probably my least favorite of the main characters from the first book, which is certainly suboptimal, given that he's the only one to survive... (Also, the Coke fixation is weird.) But why does everyone else keep him around?</p>
<p>On the other hand, the world building continues to be excellent. We get a few neat twists (like what the reservoir conditions might actually mean) and dig a little deeper into the conspiracy behind it all. Given that there's still one more book, we don't get quite as much of that as I'd like, but so it goes. Still though, it feels like Grant really did her homework. The zombie threat feels real. That's saying something.</p>
<p>And then... The ending. One thing I don't care about in second books of trilogies is when they don't have an ending of their own. If Deadline had ended around 80%, it would have been fine. Instead, we get the ALL NEW BIGGER AND BETTER THREAT in the last 20% or so. Don't get me wrong, I really want to know how it all shakes out, but it's still annoying.</p>
<p>And then and then... That last sentence. Say <b>what!?</b></p>
<p>Needless to say, onwards to Blackout.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11806716-blackout"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/30/newsflesh-trilogy/3-blackout.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>A solid ending to a solid series. I think that I liked it more than Deadline, but less than Feed, owing entirely to one thing: George.</p>
<p>Yup, she's back. Literally the last thing that happens in Deadline gets fleshed out (heh) in Blackout as we alternate once again between Shaun's and Georgia's viewpoints. It's fairly obvious what's happened (and a neat extension of what we already know about the zombie virus), but that doesn't mean I was still rooting for her nevertheless.</p>
<p>That being said, her being back complicates Shaun's situation somewhat. He's not any less crazy and as odd as it sounds, his underlings are still just dealing with it. <spoiler>What's more, it's made explicit here that Georgia and Shaun have been sleeping together. I get it, and they're adopted rather than blood siblings, but it still feels a little off.</spoiler></p>
<p>Other than that, it's a solid conclusion to the series. We finally learn who the big bads are--although it's not a huge twist. We get a few more complications with the zombie virus with several nice showdowns across the country. The ending is less 'they all lived happily ever after' and more 'we may just survive this', but given the events of the stories, that's good enough for me. At least it's not a cliffhanger like Deadline...</p>
<p>Overall, great book, great series. Not quite on my list of favorites ever, but I'm glad I read it.</p>

<p>Next up, we get a nice fantasy adventure based on Arabic history, rather than the European fantasy I've read piles of: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11487807-throne-of-the-crescent-moon">Throne of the Crescent Moon</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4025591.Saladin_Ahmed">Saladin Ahmed</a></p>

<hr />
<p>My master is not always the brightest of men.</p>
<p>Not in all regards, not in all things.</p>
<p>But he paid for my mother's transition, when there was no pressing need that he do such a thing. So far as I can tell, he didn't even know what he was paying for.</p>
<p>And for that, I shall be eternally grateful.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For that, I shall protect him from himself.</p>
<p>The package arrived as all do, the sigils of the Parcel's Guild marking the edges. Lord Bronwin did not even seem to recognize them. Granted, it is generally I who answers the door.</p>
<p>In this instance though, Lord Bronwin was walking to the stairs when the package was delivered and as such took an inordinate interest in its contents.</p>
<p>That alone should have been enough to warn me that something was awry. Not in the sense that I recognized the package for what it was--something more subtle. My mother had always said that I had a gift for seeing what truly was.</p>
<p>Yet still, I opened the package. I couldn't very well explain such a feeling to my master. Not without more to go on than just that.</p>
<p>Inside the package, there were three smaller packages and a note. Before I could stop him, Lord Bronwin had snatched the letter from the package and began to read.</p>
<p>My uneasy feeling was confirmed. I could see in his face that it was not good news. And from the sidelong look he spared me, I was involved.</p>
<p>Still, I well knew my place. If my master required it of me, I would do it. No matter the personal cost.</p>
<hr />
<p>Without telling me precisely why, my master bid me prepare his carriage to go to market. While it was common enough for me to go to market--especially on such days when other servants of the hour could not attend to such duties--Lord Bronwin had never, to my knowledge, gone.</p>
<p>Yet an order was an order, and without seeing the letter, I had no particular reason to believe that my master was in any danger whatsoever. So of course, I was going to have to take the letter.</p>
<hr />
<p>My opportunity came just as we were leaving.</p>
<p>In order to step up into the carriage, while still holding on to all three of the individual packages, Lord Bronwin needed both of his hands. Thus he had no room to hold the letter and handed it to me. With only the barest of moments to glance at its contents, I managed to catch only a section:</p>
<p><center> ... your indiscretions shall become common knowledge. Do not send Johanas. ... </center></p>
<p>Then, my master held his waiting hand back out the door, the expectance clear in his stance.</p>
<p>I handed it back, my brain whirling with activity.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure which bothered me more.</p>
<p>The reference to 'indiscretions' or my own name.</p>
<p>At least it explained why he was being particularly short with me.</p>
<p>I would just have to help him without knowing any more. Surely I could do that.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the edge of the market, my master signaled for me to stop the carriage. I made to go to the door to let him out--despite still thinking his plan mad--but he waved me off. Instead, he asked me to find the first two I could find willing to act as couriers. Curious.</p>
<p>It took some short time, but eventually I found a golem and a young boy on the street. The golem seemed to be off duty and more than happy enough to take my--and by extension, Lord Bronwin's--money. Of course, it was hard to read anything on the expressionless, voiceless face, but once a golem agreed to a job, they were incredibly reliable.</p>
<p>The young boy, he at least seemed enthusiastic. And what was more, he didn't seem to have much in the way of bargaining skill. Two silver pennies? A steal.</p>
<p>Then we were off again. It seemed that he wanted to hand deliver one of the three smaller packages. Again, it wasn't my place to question my master, but if he were going to hand deliver one of them himself, then why not deliver all three?</p>
<p>I was still contemplating said thought when a flash of movement just before me drew my attention.</p>
<p>I only had a moment to see a golem walking directly across my path before a terrible screech and the rearing of the metal beasts pulling the carriage required all of my attention.</p>
<p>The horses were strange that way. It wasn't that they were spooked; mechanical beasts as they were, they didn't get spooked. Rather they were trying to avoid damaging either themselves or the golem who had darted in front of them.</p>
<p>At least they succeeded in one.</p>
<p>I saw the golem's head pop off and roll an arm's length away. From what I knew about golems, that wasn't actually fatal--although what does fatal mean to something that is not alive?</p>
<p>I heard my master's voice call up from the carriage. "What's the trouble?"</p>
<p>I debated a second, but only a second. My primary duty was to him, not to these packages. There was a chance that the situation would devolve. The sooner his package was delivered, the sooner we could return to the safety of his mansion.</p>
<p>"Nothing, sir," I said, already directing the steeds to continue on their way.</p>
<hr />
<p>We dropped off the package my master had kept and he had me retreat a safe distance to watch the other two. Or at least, I assume the distance was such that he thought it safe. I wouldn't have minded a few blocks more.</p>
<p>The boy arrived first. He put the package down without even really paying terribly much attention to it. Instead, he was inspecting a metalic object. It took a moment for me to place it.</p>
<p>The golem's head.</p>
<p>I shook my own.</p>
<p>The kid was in for some trouble. The Golemancy Guild was one of the strongest organizations in the city and they didn't take kindly to anyone encroaching on their turf, even unintentionally. I thought to give the boy a bit of advice, but I was sure he wouldn't take it.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, just as I was about to ask Lord Bronwin what exactly he was waiting for, the golem trotted up as well. I admit, I was surprised to see it. It was one thing to know that a golem can lose a head with little to no ill effect; it was quite another to experience it first hand, as it were.</p>
<p>Still, that meant that we had all three packages. That meant we could head home.</p>
<p>We tarried only a moment longer before Lord Bronwin signaled me onward. He seemed to be debating something, although he wouldn't go so far as to tell me.</p>
<p>Halfway home, there was a sharp report. The sound of an explosion, followed closely by two more. I waited, letting the horses trod their inexorable way home, but that was it.</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>Three explosions.</p>
<p>Three packages.</p>
<p>It had to be a coincidence.</p>
<p>Didn't it?</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>San Mateo Clouds</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/24/san-mateo-clouds" /><id>urn:uuid:27400fc2-efed-6f19-8dca-dcd76f9d887b</id><updated>2015-09-24T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Took an after lunch walk around San Mateo.

<!--more-->
<p>Since there are only two and they're not particularly directly related to one another, here are the individual reviews:</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68427.Elantris"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/18/elantris/elantris.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I have yet to find a Sanderson novel that I don't particularly like and Elantris is no exception.</p>
<p>Basically, Elantris focuses around the titular city; once a place of wonder and magic which. Ten years ago, all that ended and now it's populated by essentially zombies: those without heartbeats who cannot die and cannot heal. We follow a few different story lines--a princess from another land engaged to the prince who gets Elantrisified in the very beginning of the story; an attempted religious coup from multiple fronts; and the politics of a kingdom/city trying to heal after massive upheaval.</p>
<p>This is his earliest work and in some ways it shows. He actually commented recently on the <a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/">Writing Excuses</a> podcast that he co-hosts that he's learned a lot about pacing since writing Elantris. Towards the end, I definitely noticed it. In the last 10% or so of the novel, everything comes to a head all at once. I think it could have been even strong had some of the storylines come to fruition earlier.</p>
<p>I did like a lot of the characters. Sarene reminds me strongly of Shallan from The Way of Kings (perhaps because it's the most recent other Sanderson novel I've read), but I think I actually like her more. Raoden seems almost too good to be true, but keeps just enough human trivialities (especially when interacting with Sarene), that I still like him. I particularly grew to like Hrathen. It's always interesting to see how fantasy novels interact with religion.</p>
<p>More than anything, I wish this novel had a sequel. Well, it sort of does in [book: The Emperor's Soul|13578175], although that it in a completely different part of the world. It looks like there is a true sequel in the works though (<a href="http://brandonsanderson.com/faq-will-there-be-a-sequel-to-elantris/">FAQ</a>). Awesome.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13578175-the-emperor-s-soul"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/18/elantris/the-emperors-soul.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>If I hadn't been told, at first I wouldn't realize that The Emperor's Soul takes place in a far away corner of the same world as Elantris. But as the story wears on, and the details of the magic system are revealed, it becomes more obvious that the worlds are one and the same. I really do love how Sanderson does magic systems. I've never seen anything quite like it, especially not at the same scale. Every system seems new, yet there's a shared core to all of them. I love it.</p>
<p>Other than that, I did like the character of Shai. There's something about an artist who works entirely to know that she did it, rather than for public acclaim that I enjoy. Sneaky and subtle. Excellent. I could see a few of the twists coming (that she wouldn't escape until the last moment; the changes she made), but that didn't make it any less enjoyable.</p>
<p>One thing I'd love to see if/when that Elantris sequel comes out? A meeting between the worlds. How would a Forger interact with an Elantrian? What about a Bloodsealer? I want to know more about them.</p>
<p>"You can't always write what you know--not exactly what you know. You can, however, write what you see." -- Brandon Sanderson</p>
<hr />
<p>With that, I have only <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1268479.Warbreaker">Warbreaker</a> left among Sanderson's <a href="http://coppermind.net/wiki/Cosmere">Cosmere</a> novels<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span> and a few of the non-Cosmere ones.  Dang, he's prolific.</p>

<p>Next up on my <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a>: The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/70323-partials-sequence">Partials Sequence</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2740668.Dan_Wells">Dan Wells</a>.</p>
<p>I actually found Dan Wells through the <a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/">Writing Excuses</a> podcast (co-host <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson?from_search=true&search_version=service">Brandon Sanderson</a> is another author I love) and I'm glad I did. Basically, Partials is the young adult post-apocalyptic trilogy that I'd been looking for without even realizing it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I've always had a problem with worlds like that in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13335037-divergent">Divergent</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games">The Hunger Games</a>. There's always something (the strict divisions between classes and the titular Games for two examples) that just doesn't make sense. In my opinion, Partials doesn't really have that.</p>
<p>You have a war (which ended years before the series takes place) that genetically engineered super soldiers were created to fight on behalf of humanity. After that, you have a bio-weapon / virus that wipes out 99.96% of humanity and, in this case, renders the remaining tens of thousands sterile. I would like to think it unlikely, but all of that--and the story that develops from there--seems believable for the not too distant future. All together, I enjoyed Partials even more than I expected. It's even better having listened to several seasons now of Writing Excuses--I know about Wells and the writing process he goes through than I do many authors. As mentioned in my individual review for the third book: If Divergent / The Hunger Games left you wanting more, this is it. If you haven't read either, read these instead.</p>
<p>Here are my individual reviews as I went:</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12476820-partials"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/16/partials-sequence/1-partials.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The story of Partials takes place 11 years after humanity lost a terrible war. Basically, we created super soldiers (Partials) to fight for us. Of course, after they won the war they turned on us... Worse yet, right at the same time, there was a virus which killed 99.96% of humanity--including any new pregnancies.</p>
<p>So that's where we start. Humanity is stuck on Long Island while the Partials are <i>out there</i>™. Because no babies can survive the virus, the youngest living people are 14. The main characters are roughly 16. Even stranger, in an effort to figure out how to cure the virus, the Hope Act has been enacted. All women 18 or older must get pregnant as often as possible.</p>
<p>It's an odd premise, but each part at least follows through. It's a little strange that the main characters are so good at what they do (always a problem with YA fiction), but at least the idea that they had to grow up quickly helps offset that.</p>
<p>Other than that, it's an interesting world. The action keeps things moving, especially towards the latter end of the book, and I actually feel for the characters as things keep going sideways on them. There were a few twists that followed the standard YA post-apocalyptic tropes (is that a thing now) but a few that I missed, which is nice.</p>
<p>Overall, it's perhaps not as strong as some of the other books I've read this year (although it's the best post-apocalyptic YA :)), but it's more than good enough to finish the series.</p>
<p>Onward!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13645264-isolation"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/16/partials-sequence/0.5-isolation.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Quick and to the point, Isolation tells the story of Heron (who we met briefly in Partials) during the Isolation War. It gives a better picture into the Partials: how they are made, how they are trained, and why they might not only want to, but even been the right to, kill us.</p>
<p>It's a good story and I hope to see more of Heron in the second and third books of the Partials Sequence. It'll be interesting to see how she's grown and changed in the intervening years and how she interacts with the other human (and not) protagonists.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13170596-fragments"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/16/partials-sequence/2-fragments.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>A good continuation to Partials. In this book, we see Kira start to come to terms with who she is as she sets off with Samm and Heron across what's left of the United States in search of answers--only to find more than she was looking for. Meanwhile, Marcus is back home, stuck between two warring Partial factions, trying desperately to broker a piece.</p>
<p>It's a neat continuation. I like watching the world expand, exploring more of what happened in the decade and change since everything fell apart. We're starting to get some answers, which of course lead to more questions. I look forward to Ruins, cautiously hoping that Wells can pull everything together for the finale.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17607716-ruins"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/16/partials-sequence/3-ruins.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>A solid ending to a solid series.</p>
<p>I think Ruins actually managed to pull things together in a way without feeling (too) rushed that none of the other YA series recently have managed to pull off. The previous plotlines (Kira's conflicted nature, the rest of the Trust, the cure(s)) all come to a head in a way that's still driving enough to finish the series but don't feel like the author was just phoning it in.</p>
<p>There were a few things that I felt were just glanced over.</p>
<p>Kira manages to succeed where a decade of scientists (including those who caused the problem in the first place) have failed. That seems strange. But it's at least lamp shaded in that they were too blind to see a solution.</p>
<p>The two new Trust members come out of nowhere and never really make much sense. Plus, they're just sort of resolved. They're interesting, but I feel like they could have done more.</p>
<p>The love triangle just vanishes. Perhaps more real world accurate and I cannot believe I'm saying this: but it was weird.</p>
<p>All together though, a solid read and a solid series. If Divergent / The Hunger Games left you wanting more, this is it. If you haven't read either, read these instead.</p>
<hr />
<p>So far, GoodReads says that I've read 71 books this year, with a total of 25,513 pages. Given that today is the 258th day of the year, that averages out to 100 pages per day and I'm right on target. Let's see if I can keep that up for the last third of the year... Especially with <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/nanowrimo">NaNoWriMo</a> looming just over the horizon.</p>
<p>Up next, another apocalypse. Zombies this time, in The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/47749-newsflesh">Newsflesh Trilogy</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3153776.Mira_Grant">Mira Grant</a>.</p>

<p>Since I was already working on Python code that would render an image given a function (for a future post), I figured that I might as well render fractals with it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The basic idea is simple. Use <a href="https://python-pillow.github.io/">pillow</a> (the successor <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a>), create an empty image of a given size. Then, call a given function for each point in that image, passing the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of the function as parameters. Basically, the <code><a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/search/index.html?q=build-flomap*">build-flomap*</a></code> function I use all the time in Racket.</p>
<p>It turns out, that's actually really straight forward:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def generate_image(width, height, generator):
    '''
    Generate an RGB image using a generator function.

    width, height -- the size of the generated image
    generator -- a function that takes (x, y) and returns (r, g, b)
    '''

    # Generate the data as a row-major list of (r, g, b)
    data = [generator(x, y) for y in range(height) for x in range(width)]

    # Pack that into a Pillow image and return it
    img = PIL.Image.new('RGB', (width, height))
    img.putdata(data)
    return img</code></pre>
<p>I like that you can have multiple <code>for</code> statements in a generator like that. It's very similiar to the different forms of Racket's <code><a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/search/index.html?q=for">for</a></code><span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>, but I always seem to forget that I can do that in Python.</p>
<p>One downside of this is that it's relatively slow (at least on the big multi-core machines we have now). Luckily, we can use the <code><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html">multiprocessing</a></code> module to speed things up:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def generate_image(width, height, generator, threads = 1):
    '''
    Generate an RGB image using a generator function.

    width, height -- the size of the generated image
    generator -- a function that takes (x, y) and returns (r, g, b)
    threads -- if != 1, use multiprocessing to spawn this many processes
    '''

    # Generate the data as a row-major list of (r, g, b)
    if threads == 1:
        data = [generator(x, y) for y in range(height) for x in range(width)]
    else:
        pool = multiprocessing.Pool(threads)
        data = pool.starmap(generator, [(x, y) for y in range(height) for x in range(width)])

    # Pack that into a Pillow image and return it
    img = PIL.Image.new('RGB', (width, height))
    img.putdata(data)
    return img</code></pre>
<p>By using <code>multiprocessing</code> rather than <code>threading</code>, we are actually spawning multiple Python processes, so we get a true multithreaded speedup. Since this program is almost entirely CPU bound, <code>threading</code> (with Python's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_interpreter lock">global interpreter lock</a>) wouldn't actually be any faster.</p>
<p>An aside: Using <code>starmap</code> allows us to pass multiple parameters to the function we are mapping over. This was only introduced in Python 2.6 / 3.3, so make sure you have a sufficiently new version<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>With that, we can make some pretty pictures like I'm sure I've shown off before<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></span>.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>generate_image(
    400,
    300,
    lambda x, y: (
        (x * y) % 256,
        (x + y) % 256,
        max(x, y) % 256
    )
).save('sample.png')</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/14/mandelbrot/sample.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/14/mandelbrot/sample.png" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, I realize that's not the most Pythonic code in the world. And because the body of a Python <code>lambda</code> has to be an expression, you cannot write nearly as complicated functions as you could in Racket. It's perfectly valid though. :)</p>
<p>Okay, so we have a way to generate images, let's use it to generate Mandelbrot sets. The basic idea of the Mandelbrot set is surprisingly simple<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></span>:</p>
<p>Given a complex number <span>\( \mathbb{C} \)</span>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/complex_number">complex</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quadratic_polynomial">quadratic polynomial</a>:</p>
<div>$$\mathbb{Z}_n+1 = \mathbb{Z}_n^2 + \mathbb{C}$$</div>
<p>Either does or does not escape to infinity. If the result remains bounded as <span>\( n \to \infty \)</span>, the number is part of the Mandelbrot set. If not, it's not. Because Python has built in support for complex numbers, this code is fairly elegant:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def make_mandelbrot_generator(width, height, center, size, max_iterations = 256):
        '''
        A generator that makes generate_image compatible mandelbrot generators.

        width, height -- the size of the resulting image (used for scale)
        center -- the focus point of the image
        size -- the size of the larger dimension
        max_iterations -- the scale to check before exploding, used for coloring
        '''

        # Scale the size so that is the size of the larger dimension
        if width &gt;= height:
            size_x = size
            size_y = size * height / width
        else:
            size_x = size * width / height
            size_y = size

        # Convert to a bounding box
        min_x = center[0] - size_x / 2
        max_x = center[0] + size_x / 2
        min_y = center[1] - size_y / 2
        max_y = center[1] + size_y / 2

        def generator(x, y):
            # Scale to the mandlebrot frame; convert to a complex number
            x = (x / width) * (max_x - min_x) + min_x
            y = (y / height) * (max_y - min_y) + min_y
            c = x + y * 1j

            # Iterate until we escape to infinity or run out of iterations
            # For our purposes, we can consider infinity = 2
            z = 0
            for iteration in range(max_iterations):
                z = z * z + c

                # Size is r of polar coordinates
                (r, phi) = cmath.polar(z)
                if r &gt; 2:
                    break

            g = int(256 * iteration / max_iterations)
            return (g, g, g)

        return generator</code></pre>
<p>I've chosen here to make a function that returns the actual color generator primarily so that we would have access to the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> within the main function.</p>
<p>Amusingly, it's been proven that if the magnitude of <span>\(\mathbb{Z}_n\)</span> crosses 2, it will go to infinity. Since <code>r</code> is the magnitude in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polar_coordinate system">polar coordinate system</a> (<code>r</code>,<code>ϕ</code>), we can use that as an escape hatch and even as a basic way to color the output.</p>
<p>One side note: using the <code>multiprocessing</code> module, we have to be able to <code><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html">pickle</a></code> any variables to the function called. Functions defined in the global scope can be pickled, but functions used directly as parameters to other functions cannot; don't ask me why.</p>
<p>So if <code>threads</code> is not 1, this does not work:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>generate_image(
    400,
    300,
    make_mandelbrot_generator(400, 300, (-0.5, 0), 3),
    threads = 4
)</code></pre>
<p>But this does:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>generator = make_mandelbrot_generator(400, 300, (-0.5, 0), 3),
generate_image(400, 300, generator, threads = 4)</code></pre>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Anyways, what do we get when we try it out?</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/14/mandelbrot/mandelbrot_default_400x300_grayscale.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/14/mandelbrot/mandelbrot_default_400x300_grayscale.png" /></a></p>
<p>Beautiful<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a></sup></span>!</p>
<p>We need some color. Let's introduce one more parameter to the <code>make_mandelbrot_generator</code> function: <code>coloring</code>. Basically, a function that takes in a number in the range <code>[0, 1]</code> (which we're already computing; that is <code>iteration / max_iterations</code>) and return an RGB color. That way, we can have some more interesting colorations.</p>
<p>For example, the grayscale coloring function from earlier:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def grayscale(v):
    '''Simple grayscale value.'''

    g = int(256 * v)
    return (g, g, g)</code></pre>
<p>Or how about instead, we render something in blue and red. Start at black, then fade up the blue channel, crossfade to red in the next third, and fade back to black in the last:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def hot_and_cold(v):
    '''Scale from black to blue to red and back to black.'''

    r = g = b = 0

    if v &lt; 1/3:
        v = 3 * v
        b = int(256 * v)
    elif v &lt; 2/3:
        v = 3 * (v - 1/3)
        r = int(256 * v)
        b = int(256 * (1 - v))
    else:
        v = 3 * (v - 2/3)
        r = int(256 * (1 - v))

    return (r, g, b)</code></pre>
<p>Let's render that one instead:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>generator = make_mandelbrot_generator(400, 300, (-0.5, 0), 3),
generate_image(400, 300, generator, threads = 4, coloring = hot_and_cold)</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/14/mandelbrot/mandelbrot_default_400x300_hot-and-cold.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/14/mandelbrot/mandelbrot_default_400x300_hot-and-cold.png" /></a></p>
<p>Excellent. We have a simple Mandelbrot generator. It's not exactly what I set out to do for this post (really only the <code>generate_image</code> function is), but I think it's pretty cool.</p>
<p>As a bonus round, I made something of a basic testing framework:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>THREAD_COUNT = max(1, multiprocessing.cpu_count() - 1)

SIZES = [
    (400, 300),
    (1920, 1080)
]

COLORINGS = [
    ('grayscale', grayscale),
    ('hot-and-cold', hot_and_cold),
]

IMAGES = [
    ('default', (-0.5, 0), 3),
    # http://www.nahee.com/Derbyshire/manguide.html
    ('seahorse-valley', (-0.75, 0.1), 0.05),
    ('triple-spiral-valley', (0.088, 0.654), 0.25),
    ('quad-spiral-valley', (0.274, 0.482), 0.005),
    ('double-scepter-valley', (-0.1, 0.8383), 0.005),
    ('mini-mandelbrot', (-1.75, 0), 0.1),

]

for width, height in SIZES:
    for image_name, center, size in IMAGES:
        for coloring_name, coloring in COLORINGS:
            filename = os.path.join('{width}x{height}', 'mandelbrot_{name}_{width}x{height}_{coloring}.png')

What was the process of thought that led to your loss? Now, replicate that moment in the dramatic structure of the story, except the story isn't about games.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The almost. The not quite. The second place.</p>
<p>All words to describe a feeling. A state of mind. That of not quite making it, when you knew in your heart of hearts that you should.</p>
<p>And what makes it even worse: it <em>should</em> have been me.</p>
<p>I should have been the one to make the run.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I should have been the pilot on that fateful trip, the one whose name all of history would remember. Instead, I'm doomed to be the backup, the understudy, the one who gets a footnote--if that.</p>
<p>I should have been the one to say those first words.</p>
<p>Let me tell you. They would have been a far sight better than, "Oh shit."</p>
<p>I'm not kidding. Those were his first words. The first spoken words ever relayed from the orbit of Pluto itself, taking a thousand times longer to return to Earth than the outbound trip had taken in the first place.</p>
<p>"Oh shit."</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I get it. After all, after a single trip, the Alcubierre had blown a fuse in the most spectacular way possible. The ring was shattered, very nearly taking the ship itself with it. Without a way home, it was going to be a long trip.</p>
<p>Marshall recovered well enough, acquitting himself well of his training. He went ahead and read the speech that the whole world would one day know had been prepared for him. He even made it sound off the cuff; like he was just making it up on the spot.</p>
<p>But when kids look back on this day, they won't remember the speech. With a half-hidden snicker  at the forbidden (that of course the teacher will see) they'll move on with their lives, forgetting what really mattered about the trip. Forgetting that Marshall opened the stars to them. Forgetting that I even existed at all. All they'll remember is those fateful words.</p>
<p>"Oh shit."</p>
<p>Now it's all up to me. I get to be the one to go to his rescue. The Atlas has been rushed into service, the final weeks' worth of checkups compressed into three days. The powers that be wanted it to be even faster, to prove that even in the face of such adversity we would <em>not</em> back down.</p>
<p>But the scientists and engineers that had built the Atlas put their collective foot down. Three days. Absolute minimum. Any less and they might as well be flying blind.</p>
<p>Truth be told, that would have been all right with me.</p>
<p>Better story that way.</p>
<p>No one remembers second place.</p>
<p>They say they've ironed out the kinks this time. One in a million, this time. One in a million chance that I'll make it out to Pluto and be stuck out there with Marshall. No hope for either us. Not only doomed to die a cold lonely death, but to be second place even then.</p>
<p>Nope, no sir, not going to happen.</p>
<p>I'm going to save the day.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the ion drives took me farther and farther from Lagrange Station, I was struck with a sudden sense of deja vu.</p>
<p>Everything I was doing was something I had already done before. The ion drives, the checklists, the charts. Making sure that the fusion generators were running to the edge of their capacity, charging the capacitors that would eventually feed the Alcubierre ring which made everything possible.</p>
<p>The feeling was so sudden and so strong; for a moment I lost where I was. Of course this mission would succeed, it already had. I didn't need to go and save Marshall, I already had. Everything would proceed as it always had proceeded.</p>
<p>Except if it didn't.</p>
<p>When the rational part of my mind caught up, I realized that I was remembering the hours upon hours that I had spent in the Atlas simulator. In virtual reality, the mission planners had thrown every possible situation they could think of at me--and some they didn't; the computers themselves had at times a sick sense of challenge.</p>
<p>I knew the mission like the back of my hand. Better even. Who actually knew the back of their hand that well anyway?</p>
<p>A blinking light on the control screen in front of me caught my attention. The ion drive had shut off after the preprogrammed interval. So wrapped up in my own thoughts; I hadn't even noticed. Nothing more than a stream of ionized particles, ion drives didn't light a candle to the chemical rockets of the olden days. Far more efficient of course, especially with the fusion generator to power them. But still, wouldn't it have been something to ride an explosion into the night?</p>
<p>Without the ion drive, I was drifting. Even drifting, I was traveling at what would have been a breakneck pace in an atmosphere. In the cold emptiness of space, there was no way to judge just how fast I was going.</p>
<p>And soon, I would be moving much, much faster.</p>
<hr />
<p>The general idea behind the Alcubierre is deceptively simple. Nothing can move faster than the speed of light. Einstein discovered that particular wrinkle centuries ago and it was as true now as it was then.</p>
<p>But there was a catch: nothing can move faster than the speed of light. But you don't have to.</p>
<p>Space itself would.</p>
<p>Short version: space is flexible. It can expand and contract, most often under the influence of gravitational fields. What's more, said expansions can move faster than the speed of light, seeing as, strictly speaking, nothing was moving.</p>
<p>I'll admit, the idea still seemed odd to me when I thought about it too carefully. But essentially, that was the idea. Using physics well beyond my own understanding, the Alcubierre drive created a wave in the fabric of space itself.</p>
<p>That was me. A cosmic surfer. The second human being in history to ride a space bubble to the edge of the solar system.</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm not sure why I imagined that the reality of the Alcubierre drive would be any different from the simulators.</p>
<p>Despite that fact that I was traveling just shy of a hundred times the speed of light, as far as I could tell I might as well have been standing still.</p>
<p>The moment the Alcubierre drive had engaged, the stars had gone out. It was a curious side effect of the Alcubierre field that light tends to slide along the sides of the field, colliding in a faint wake on the far side. I'm told it's for the best: even the light of a star can be blinding when you're colliding with a hundred times as many photons per second.</p>
<p>Still, it's disconcerting.</p>
<p>Now that the drive was engaged, I had only to wait.</p>
<p>162 seconds.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>5 billion kilometers, and I'd be there in less than three minutes.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that it should have been me out there and Marshall flying to <em>my</em> rescue, I had to admit... That was pretty cool.</p>
<hr />
<p>With fifteen seconds to go, I could feel my heart rate picking up. Based on Marshall's reports and what little long range telemetry mission control had received, this is when the Prometheus' Alcubierre ring had failed. When collapsing the wave and returning space to its normal configuration.</p>
<p>The engineers on the project claimed they had found the issue. An instability in the equations governing the turbulence of quantum foam stirred up by the collapse of an Alcubierre field. Or something like that. It was something that hadn't come up in years of automated testing, so the chances of it happening twice in a row were essentially nil.</p>
<p>At least that was what they said.</p>
<p>They also claimed that they'd tweaked the timing. Collapse the field a fraction of a second more slowly and the turbulence would be directed perpendicular to the ring, rather than directly into.</p>
<p>Personally, I thought that was something they should have thought of before sending the first ship. But what do I know?</p>
<p>Ten seconds. Was this it? Was this the moment when I became the second person in the history of the human race to set eyes directly on Pluto?</p>
<p>Nine.</p>
<p>Eight. A slight vibration echoed through my seat. Something that had never come up in the simulation.</p>
<p>Seven.</p>
<p>Six.</p>
<p>Five. The vibration was back, hard enough up and down that I could hear my own teeth rattling together.</p>
<p>Nothing I could do about it now. If I didn't shut down the Alcubierre drive, there was no telling where I would end up. Two weeks and I could be at Alpha Centauri--if that was the way I was facing.</p>
<p>I wish I'd thought to look that up before I left.</p>
<p>Four.</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>Two. I shut my eyes.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<hr />
<p>Gradually, I became aware of a sound.</p>
<p>My eyes were still squeezed shut. I found in that moment that I didn't want to know. I didn't want to know if I was to be the hero who rescued the first Alcubierre test pilot or only its second victim.</p>
<p>But there was a sound in my cockpit, a sound that I recognized.</p>
<p>"Carter? That you?"</p>
<p>Marshall. I'd talked to him less than a week ago, at his going away celebration. It was a bittersweet moment, knowing that--unless something went horribly wrong--he was going to be taking my spot in history. But I had to be happy for him. After all, if something <em>did</em> go horribly wrong, I couldn't be too happy about it. Too suspicious.</p>
<p>Slowly, I opened my eyes. Scanned the control screen.</p>
<p>A few numbers were on the high side, but all well within parameters.</p>
<p>I glanced out the viewports.</p>
<p>The Alcubierre ring. Solid. Unbroken.</p>
<p>I let out a breath I hadn't known I'd been holding.</p>
<p>"Ha," I cried out, "Take that, Einstein."</p>
<p>What can I say? At least it was better than 'oh shit.'</p>
<hr />
<p>It took the better part of six hours to match velocity with the Prometheus and link the two ships.</p>
<p>Marshall was going to have to abandon his ship. For the moment, only the Atlas would be going home. Theoretically, it would be possible to Alcubierre field to move both ships, even linked together as they were now. It wasn't like they were actually moving after all.</p>
<p>But that had been deemed too much a risk by the powers that be. 'Bring him home,' they'd said. There would be other missions. Prove that the technology works and the stars were quite literally the limit.</p>
<p>The ride home was cramped but uneventful. Both the Promethus and the Atlas were designed with a second seat just behind the pilot's for incidents exactly such as this--well, not exactly, but you get the drift. That doesn't mean it's particularly comfortable.</p>
<p>The same as the way back, it only took 160 seconds to return to Earth orbit. Of course, that was after six hours to link, another for the spacewalk, and two more on top of that for the Atlas' computer to calculate the proper trajectory home.</p>
<p>That's one of the problems with moving so fast--if you're off by even a little, you can easily end up thousands of millions from the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>But we made it, and in the end, that's all that's important. We'd done it. We'd taken an unbreakable law of nature and gone right around it. The stars were open to us, to all of humanity.</p>
<p>And I was part of the story.</p>
<p>Second place.</p>
<p>But hey, I got to be the hero. Perhaps second place isn't so bad after all.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Backing up GitHub repositories</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/08/backing-up-github-repositories" /><id>urn:uuid:1441231b-25d9-0022-7eb4-23a4966e0f50</id><updated>2015-09-08T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The newest chapter in my quest to collect entirely too much data / back up All The Things!: GitHub.</p>

<p>Basically, I want to back up all of my own personal GitHub repositories along with any from organizations that I am involved with. Strictly speaking, this is a little strange, since it's unlikely that GitHub is going anywhere soon and, if it does, we are likely to have fair warning. But still, it's nice to have a local copy just in case GitHub is down.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The code is actually really straight forward. Most of the heavy lifting is being done by the <a href="https://github.com/copitux/python-github3">pygithub3</a> library. One caveat: it's a little strange to install. In my case, I had to first install <code>pygithub</code> and then <code>pygithub3</code> in order to satisfy a missing dependency (<a href="https://github.com/copitux/python-github3/issues/41">previously reported</a>).</p>
<p>After that, you can authenticate to GitHub, get a list of repositories, and download them all:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import pygithub3
import os

# Load a list of repos we don't want to download / update
ignored = set()
if os.path.exists('ignore.txt'):
    with open('ignore.txt', 'r') as fin:
        for line in fin:
            ignored.add(line.strip())

# Connect to github (if you have MFA, your password must be a token)
gh = pygithub3.Github(os.environ['GITHUB_USERNAME'], os.environ['GITHUB_PASSWORD'])

# Loop over repos for the specified user, this will include their organization's repos as well
for repo in gh.get_user().get_repos():

    remote_path = repo.ssh_url
    size = repo.size
    owner = repo.owner.login
    name = repo.name
    name_with_owner = '{owner}/{name}'.format(owner = owner, name = name)
    print(name_with_owner)

    # Check if the repo is in the ignore list
    if name in ignored or name_with_owner in ignored:
        print('... skipping')
        continue

    # Build up a list of commands that will be run for the given repo
    local_path = os.path.join('repos', owner, name)
    cmds = ['mkdir -p repos/{owner}; cd repos/{owner}'.format(owner = owner)]

    # Already exists, update it
    if os.path.exists(local_path):
        print('... updating')
        cmds += [
            'cd {name}'.format(name = name),
            'git pull --rebase --prune',                 # Update to the most recent master
            'git submodule update --init --recursive',   # Update submodules
        ]
    # Doesn't exist yet, clone it
    else:
        print('... cloning')
        cmds += [
            'git clone {url}'.format(url = remote_path), # Download a new clean copy using repo name as directory
            'cd {name}'.format(name = name),
            'git submodule update --init --recursive',   # Download and update submodules
        ]

    # Run each command specified above, bailing out if any failed (&&)
    cmds = ' && '.join(cmds)
    os.system(cmds)
    print()</code></pre>
<p>Basically, we're going to run a sequence of commands depending on if the repo was previously checked out or not. If it hasn't been (this is the first time), we want to run:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>git clone {url}</code></li>
    <li><code>cd {name}</code></li>
    <li><code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This will get the initial version and any submodules. I'm not sure that I'm going to keep the submodule code around, but in interest of keeping everything in a runnable state even if GitHub were to vanish tomorrow, it seemed a good idea.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if we want to update a previously cloned repo:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>cd {name}</code></li>
    <li><code>git pull --rebase --prune</code></li>
    <li><code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This is much the same, it just pulls any new code first.</p>
<p>And that's it. It took a little while to pull all of my repositories down (I have about 15 GB all told, counting various private repositories from work and my university days (which I still help to maintain)), but that's only necessary the first time. After that, it's much quicker.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Writing Excuses 10.5: The Market - Noble</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/07/writing-excuses-10-5-the-market-noble" /><id>urn:uuid:a1e87807-71e4-b2f4-9615-71dae2bc7c47</id><updated>2015-09-07T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/2015/01/25/writing-excuses-10-4-qa-on-ideas/">Writing Excuses 10.5</a> writing prompt</strong>: <em>Take three different characters and walk them through a scene.

<p>The market is not a place in which I usually find myself.</p>
<p>It is noisy and rife with chaos, the throngs pressing into one another all along the way.</p>
<p>Yet today I find myself in unusual circumstances, descending into those very same masses.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>Night before last, I received a most unusual package, dropped upon my doorstop with nary so much as note or notice. Not even a courier, one whom I could ask from where the package originated.</p>
<p>It was a simple box, as white as new fallen snow, with a thin red line running around the summit of the sides. Neither a style nor material to which I was accustomed.</p>
<p>At my word, my manservant Johanas sliced the box across the top in a single smooth motion, lifting two thick flaps to either side so that I might gaze at the contents therein.</p>
<p>Imagine then my surprise, when inside of the box I found but three smaller packages, each in a more traditional brown wrapping paper, tied with a piece of twine and sealed with wax. Lying on top of the three of them, a piece of thick parchment, waxy to the touch.</p>
<p>Said letter contained only three lines, in a thin spidery hand I had never before seen:</p>
<p><em>Deliver to Temple of Acbris before sunfall, three days hence</em></p>
<p><em>Failure to comply and your indiscretions shall become common knowledge</em></p>
<p><em>Do not send Johanas. Go yourself.</em></p>
<p>It was unsigned, the only identifying mark a curving line, two figures inside of one another, like an arrow in flight.</p>
<p>Imagine, a Lord of the House of Sarane being treated in such a manner.</p>
<p>Yet the mysterious author of the note knew too much. Knowing that dear Johanas would be the one with me when I opened the package; Johanas, who I of course would have been inclined to dispatch in my stead.</p>
<p>And my ... indiscretions.</p>
<p>Yes. I of course would have to send the packages.</p>
<p>But one never said that I would have to carry all three.</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>For the first of the three, I hired a child of the street. I saw immediately from the look on his face that he would do his job and return. And all for a pair of silver marks. Pocket change.</p>
<p>The second, I handed to a golem. Dependable lot that. More expensive than the child, but dependable. The letter had been unclear on what would be the outcome were only one or two of the packages delivered.</p>
<p>The last, I took myself.</p>
<p>I had a carriage of course, pulled by a pair of mechanical steeds. Johanas drove, at my insistence. The letter had said that I must go myself, but who else might I trust to this endeavor?</p>
<p>There was only a momentary pause, halfway across the market. A crunching sound and a few quick screams. I called out to Johanas, asking what might be the matter, but he said only not to worry, that he would have me on my way in no time and all. And off we went, true to his word.</p>
<p>At the far end of the market, I for a moment considered handing Johanas the package to place at the foot of the pyre, rather than risking my own person. I had come this far; I would see it through.</p>
<p>And then it was done.</p>
<p>We parked the carriage off down the block, to allow Johanas a vantage point by which to observe the other two deliveries. He claims the boy made it first, placing his package without a second glance.</p>
<p>Then the golem, a few minutes later.</p>
<p>That surprised me somewhat, I must admit, that the young lad could outrun the steady determination of a golem. Johanas assured me though, that both packages were delivered in excellent form, joining my own.</p>
<p>And now I must hope only that the mysterious author of the letter too keeps his word. If not, well... Then perhaps I will ask Johanas to find them. Teach them precisely the meaning of the word indiscretion.</p>]]></content></entry></feed>
