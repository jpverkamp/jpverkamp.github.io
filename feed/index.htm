<p>Next up on my <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a>: The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/70323-partials-sequence">Partials Sequence</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2740668.Dan_Wells">Dan Wells</a>.</p>
<p>I actually found Dan Wells through the <a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/">Writing Excuses</a> podcast (cohost <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson?from_search=true&search_version=service">Brandon Sanderson</a> is another author I love) and I'm glad I did. Basically, Partials is the young adult post-apocalyptic trilogy that I'd been looking for without even realizing it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I've always had a problem with worlds like that in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13335037-divergent">Divergent</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games">The Hunger Games</a>. There's always something (the strict divisions between classes and the titular Games for two examples) that just doesn't make sense. In my opinion, Partials doesn't really have that.</p>
<p>You have a war (which ended years before the series takes place) that genetically engineered super soldiers were created to fight on behalf of humanity. After that, you have a bioweapon / virus that wipes out 99.96% of humanity and, in this case, renders the remaining tens of thousands sterile. I would like to think it unlikely, but all of that--and the story that developes from there--seems believable for the not too distant future. All together, I enjoyed Partials even more than I expected. It's even better having listened to several seasons now of Writing Excuses--I know about Wells and teh writing process he goes through than I do many authors. As mentioned in my individual review for the third book: If Divergent / The Hunger Games left you wanting more, this is it. If you haven't read either, read these instead.</p>
<p>Here are my individual reviews as I went:</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12476820-partials"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/16/partials-sequence/1-partials.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The story of Partials takes place 11 years after humanity lost a terrible war. Basically, we created super soldiers (Partials) to fight for us. Of course, after they won the war they turned on us... Worse yet, right at the same time, there was a virus which killed 99.96% of humanity--including any new pregnancies.</p>
<p>So that's where we start. Humanity is stuck on Long Island while the Partials are <i>out there</i>â„¢. Because no babies can survive the virus, the youngest living people are 14. The main characters are roughly 16. Even stranger, in an effort to figure out how to cure the virus, the Hope Act has been enacted. All women 18 or older must get pregnant as often as possible.</p>
<p>It's an odd premise, but each part at least follows through. It's a little strange that the main characters are so good at what they do (always a problem with YA fiction), but at least the idea that they had to grow up quickly helps offset that.</p>
<p>Other than that, it's an interesting world. The action keeps things moving, especially towards the latter end of the book, and I actually feel for the characters as things keep going sideways on them. There were a few twists that followed the standard YA post-apocalyptic tropes (is that a thing now) but a few that I missed, which is nice.</p>
<p>Overall, it's perhaps not as strong as some of the other books I've read this year (although it's the best post-apocalyptic YA :)), but it's more than good enough to finish the series.</p>
<p>Onward!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13645264-isolation"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/16/partials-sequence/0.5-isolation.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Quick and to the point, Isolation tells the story of Heron (who we met briefly in Partials) during the Isolation War. It gives a better picture into the Partials: how they are made, how they are trained, and why they might not only want to, but even been the right to, kill us.</p>
<p>It's a good story and I hope to see more of Heron in the second and third books of the Partials Sequence. It'll be interesting to see how she's grown and changed in the intervening years and how she interacts with the other human (and not) protagonists.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13170596-fragments"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/16/partials-sequence/2-fragments.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>A good continuation to Partials. In this book, we see Kira start to come to terms with who she is as she sets off with Samm and Heron across what's left of the United States in search of answers--only to find more than she was looking for. Meanwhile, Marcus is back home, stuck between two warring Partial factions, trying desperately to broker a piece.</p>
<p>It's a neat continuation. I like watching the world expand, exploring more of what happened in the decade and change since everything fell apart. We're starting to get some answers, which of course lead to more questions. I look forward to Ruins, cautiously hoping that Wells can pull everything together for the finale.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17607716-ruins"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/16/partials-sequence/3-ruins.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>A solid ending to a solid series.</p>
<p>I think Ruins actually managed to pull things together in a way without feeling (too) rushed that none of the other YA series recently have managed to pull off. The previous plotlines (Kira's conflicted nature, the rest of the Trust, the cure(s)) all come to a head in a way that's still driving enough to finish the series but don't feel like the author was just phoning it in.</p>
<p>There were a few things that I felt were just glanced over.</p>
<p>Kira manages to succeed where a decade of scientists (including those who caused the problem in the first place) have failed. That seems strange. But it's at least lamp shaded in that they were too blind to see a solution.</p>
<p>The two new Trust members come out of nowhere and never really make much sense. Plus, they're just sort of resolved. THey're interesting, but I feel like they could have done more.</p>
<p>The love triangle just vanishes. Perhaps more real world accurate and I cannot believe I'm saying this: but it was weird.</p>
<p>All together though, a solid read and a solid series. If Divergent / The Hunger Games left you wanting more, this is it. If you haven't read either, read these instead.</p>

<p>So far, GoodReads says that I've read 71 books this year, with a total of 25,513 pages. Given that today is the 258th day of the year, that averages out to 100 pages per day and I'm right on target. Let's see if I can keep that up for the last third of the year... Especially with <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/nanowrimo">NaNoWriMo</a> looming just over the horizon.</p>

<p>Since I was already working on Python code that would render an image given a function (for a future post), I figured that I might as well render fractals with it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The basic idea is simple. Use <a href="https://python-pillow.github.io/">pillow</a> (the successor <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a>), create an empty image of a given size. Then, call a given function for each point in that image, passing the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of the function as parameters. Basically, the <code><a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/search/index.html?q=build-flomap*">build-flomap*</a></code> function I use all the time in Racket.</p>
<p>It turns out, that's actually really straight forward:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def generate_image(width, height, generator):
    '''
    Generate an RGB image using a generator function.

    width, height -- the size of the generated image
    generator -- a function that takes (x, y) and returns (r, g, b)
    '''

    # Generate the data as a row-major list of (r, g, b)
    data = [generator(x, y) for y in range(height) for x in range(width)]

    # Pack that into a Pillow image and return it
    img = PIL.Image.new('RGB', (width, height))
    img.putdata(data)
    return img</code></pre>
<p>I like that you can have multiple <code>for</code> statements in a generator like that. It's very similiar to the different forms of Racket's <code><a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/search/index.html?q=for">for</a></code><span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>, but I always seem to forget that I can do that in Python.</p>
<p>One downside of this is that it's relatively slow (at least on the big multi-core machines we have now). Luckily, we can use the <code><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html">multiprocessing</a></code> module to speed things up:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def generate_image(width, height, generator, threads = 1):
    '''
    Generate an RGB image using a generator function.

    width, height -- the size of the generated image
    generator -- a function that takes (x, y) and returns (r, g, b)
    threads -- if != 1, use multiprocessing to spawn this many processes
    '''

    # Generate the data as a row-major list of (r, g, b)
    if threads == 1:
        data = [generator(x, y) for y in range(height) for x in range(width)]
    else:
        pool = multiprocessing.Pool(threads)
        data = pool.starmap(generator, [(x, y) for y in range(height) for x in range(width)])

    # Pack that into a Pillow image and return it
    img = PIL.Image.new('RGB', (width, height))
    img.putdata(data)
    return img</code></pre>
<p>By using <code>multiprocessing</code> rather than <code>threading</code>, we are actually spawning multiple Python processes, so we get a true multithreaded speedup. Since this program is almost entirely CPU bound, <code>threading</code> (with Python's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_interpreter lock">global interpreter lock</a>) wouldn't actually be any faster.</p>
<p>An aside: Using <code>starmap</code> allows us to pass multiple parameters to the function we are mapping over. This was only introduced in Python 2.6 / 3.3, so make sure you have a sufficiently new version<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>With that, we can make some pretty pictures like I'm sure I've shown off before<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></span>.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>generate_image(
    400,
    300,
    lambda x, y: (
        (x * y) % 256,
        (x + y) % 256,
        max(x, y) % 256
    )
).save('sample.png')</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/14/mandelbrot/sample.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/14/mandelbrot/sample.png" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, I realize that's not the most Pythonic code in the world. And because the body of a Python <code>lambda</code> has to be an expression, you cannot write nearly as complicated functions as you could in Racket. It's perfectly valid though. :)</p>
<p>Okay, so we have a way to generate images, let's use it to generate Mandelbrot sets. The basic idea of the Mandelbrot set is surprisingly simple<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></span>:</p>
<p>Given a complex number <span>\( \mathbb{C} \)</span>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/complex_number">complex</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quadratic_polynomial">quadratic polynomial</a>:</p>
<div>$$\mathbb{Z}_n+1 = \mathbb{Z}_n^2 + \mathbb{C}$$</div>
<p>Either does or does not escape to infinity. If the result remains bounded as <span>\( n \to \infty \)</span>, the number is part of the Mandelbrot set. If not, it's not. Because Python has built in support for complex numbers, this code is fairly elegant:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def make_mandelbrot_generator(width, height, center, size, max_iterations = 256):
        '''
        A generator that makes generate_image compatible mandelbrot generators.

        width, height -- the size of the resulting image (used for scale)
        center -- the focus point of the image
        size -- the size of the larger dimension
        max_iterations -- the scale to check before exploding, used for coloring
        '''

        # Scale the size so that is the size of the larger dimension
        if width &gt;= height:
            size_x = size
            size_y = size * height / width
        else:
            size_x = size * width / height
            size_y = size

        # Convert to a bounding box
        min_x = center[0] - size_x / 2
        max_x = center[0] + size_x / 2
        min_y = center[1] - size_y / 2
        max_y = center[1] + size_y / 2

        def generator(x, y):
            # Scale to the mandlebrot frame; convert to a complex number
            x = (x / width) * (max_x - min_x) + min_x
            y = (y / height) * (max_y - min_y) + min_y
            c = x + y * 1j

            # Iterate until we escape to infinity or run out of iterations
            # For our purposes, we can consider infinity = 2
            z = 0
            for iteration in range(max_iterations):
                z = z * z + c

                # Size is r of polar coordinates
                (r, phi) = cmath.polar(z)
                if r &gt; 2:
                    break

            g = int(256 * iteration / max_iterations)
            return (g, g, g)

        return generator</code></pre>
<p>I've chosen here to make a function that returns the actual color generator primarily so that we would have access to the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> within the main function.</p>
<p>Amusingly, it's been proven that if the magnitude of <span>\(\mathbb{Z}_n\)</span> crosses 2, it will go to infinity. Since <code>r</code> is the magnitude in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polar_coordinate system">polar coordinate system</a> (<code>r</code>,<code>Ï•</code>), we can use that as an escape hatch and even as a basic way to color the output.</p>
<p>One side note: using the <code>multiprocessing</code> module, we have to be able to <code><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html">pickle</a></code> any variables to the function called. Functions defined in the global scope can be pickled, but functions used directly as parameters to other functions cannot; don't ask me why.</p>
<p>So if <code>threads</code> is not 1, this does not work:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>generate_image(
    400,
    300,
    make_mandelbrot_generator(400, 300, (-0.5, 0), 3),
    threads = 4
)</code></pre>
<p>But this does:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>generator = make_mandelbrot_generator(400, 300, (-0.5, 0), 3),
generate_image(400, 300, generator, threads = 4)</code></pre>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Anyways, what do we get when we try it out?</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/14/mandelbrot/mandelbrot_default_400x300_grayscale.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/14/mandelbrot/mandelbrot_default_400x300_grayscale.png" /></a></p>
<p>Beautiful<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a></sup></span>!</p>
<p>We need some color. Let's introduce one more parameter to the <code>make_mandelbrot_generator</code> function: <code>coloring</code>. Basically, a function that takes in a number in the range <code>[0, 1]</code> (which we're already computing; that is <code>iteration / max_iterations</code>) and return an RGB color. That way, we can have some more interesting colorations.</p>
<p>For example, the grayscale coloring function from earlier:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def grayscale(v):
    '''Simple grayscale value.'''

    g = int(256 * v)
    return (g, g, g)</code></pre>
<p>Or how about instead, we render something in blue and red. Start at black, then fade up the blue channel, crossfade to red in the next third, and fade back to black in the last:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def hot_and_cold(v):
    '''Scale from black to blue to red and back to black.'''

    r = g = b = 0

    if v &lt; 1/3:
        v = 3 * v
        b = int(256 * v)
    elif v &lt; 2/3:
        v = 3 * (v - 1/3)
        r = int(256 * v)
        b = int(256 * (1 - v))
    else:
        v = 3 * (v - 2/3)
        r = int(256 * (1 - v))

    return (r, g, b)</code></pre>
<p>Let's render that one instead:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>generator = make_mandelbrot_generator(400, 300, (-0.5, 0), 3),
generate_image(400, 300, generator, threads = 4, coloring = hot_and_cold)</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/14/mandelbrot/mandelbrot_default_400x300_hot-and-cold.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/14/mandelbrot/mandelbrot_default_400x300_hot-and-cold.png" /></a></p>
<p>Excellent. We have a simple Mandelbrot generator. It's not exactly what I set out to do for this post (really only the <code>generate_image</code> function is), but I think it's pretty cool.</p>
<p>As a bonus round, I made something of a basic testing framework:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>THREAD_COUNT = max(1, multiprocessing.cpu_count() - 1)

SIZES = [
    (400, 300),
    (1920, 1080)
]

COLORINGS = [
    ('grayscale', grayscale),
    ('hot-and-cold', hot_and_cold),
]

IMAGES = [
    ('default', (-0.5, 0), 3),
    # http://www.nahee.com/Derbyshire/manguide.html
    ('seahorse-valley', (-0.75, 0.1), 0.05),
    ('triple-spiral-valley', (0.088, 0.654), 0.25),
    ('quad-spiral-valley', (0.274, 0.482), 0.005),
    ('double-scepter-valley', (-0.1, 0.8383), 0.005),

What was the process of thought that led to your loss? Now, replicate that moment in the dramatic structure of the story, except the story isn't about games.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The almost. The not quite. The second place.</p>
<p>All words to describe a feeling. A state of mind. That of not quite making it, when you knew in your heart of hearts that you should.</p>
<p>And what makes it even worse: it <em>should</em> have been me.</p>
<p>I should have been the one to make the run.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I should have been the pilot on that fateful trip, the one whose name all of history would remember. Instead, I'm doomed to be the backup, the understudy, the one who gets a footnote--if that.</p>
<p>I should have been the one to say those first words.</p>
<p>Let me tell you. They would have been a far sight better than, "Oh shit."</p>
<p>I'm not kidding. Those were his first words. The first spoken words ever relayed from the orbit of Pluto itself, taking a thousand times longer to return to Earth than the outbound trip had taken in the first place.</p>
<p>"Oh shit."</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I get it. After all, after a single trip, the Alcubierre had blown a fuse in the most spectacular way possible. The ring was shattered, very nearly taking the ship itself with it. Without a way home, it was going to be a long trip.</p>
<p>Marshall recovered well enough, acquitting himself well of his training. He went ahead and read the speech that the whole world would one day know had been prepared for him. He even made it sound off the cuff; like he was just making it up on the spot.</p>
<p>But when kids look back on this day, they won't remember the speech. With a half-hidden snicker  at the forbidden (that of course the teacher will see) they'll move on with their lives, forgetting what really mattered about the trip. Forgetting that Marshall opened the stars to them. Forgetting that I even existed at all. All they'll remember is those fateful words.</p>
<p>"Oh shit."</p>
<p>Now it's all up to me. I get to be the one to go to his rescue. The Atlas has been rushed into service, the final weeks' worth of checkups compressed into three days. The powers that be wanted it to be even faster, to prove that even in the face of such adversity we would <em>not</em> back down.</p>
<p>But the scientists and engineers that had built the Atlas put their collective foot down. Three days. Absolute minimum. Any less and they might as well be flying blind.</p>
<p>Truth be told, that would have been all right with me.</p>
<p>Better story that way.</p>
<p>No one remembers second place.</p>
<p>They say they've ironed out the kinks this time. One in a million, this time. One in a million chance that I'll make it out to Pluto and be stuck out there with Marshall. No hope for either us. Not only doomed to die a cold lonely death, but to be second place even then.</p>
<p>Nope, no sir, not going to happen.</p>
<p>I'm going to save the day.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the ion drives took me farther and farther from Lagrange Station, I was struck with a sudden sense of deja vu.</p>
<p>Everything I was doing was something I had already done before. The ion drives, the checklists, the charts. Making sure that the fusion generators were running to the edge of their capacity, charging the capacitors that would eventually feed the Alcubierre ring which made everything possible.</p>
<p>The feeling was so sudden and so strong; for a moment I lost where I was. Of course this mission would succeed, it already had. I didn't need to go and save Marshall, I already had. Everything would proceed as it always had proceeded.</p>
<p>Except if it didn't.</p>
<p>When the rational part of my mind caught up, I realized that I was remembering the hours upon hours that I had spent in the Atlas simulator. In virtual reality, the mission planners had thrown every possible situation they could think of at me--and some they didn't; the computers themselves had at times a sick sense of challenge.</p>
<p>I knew the mission like the back of my hand. Better even. Who actually knew the back of their hand that well anyway?</p>
<p>A blinking light on the control screen in front of me caught my attention. The ion drive had shut off after the preprogrammed interval. So wrapped up in my own thoughts; I hadn't even noticed. Nothing more than a stream of ionized particles, ion drives didn't light a candle to the chemical rockets of the olden days. Far more efficient of course, especially with the fusion generator to power them. But still, wouldn't it have been something to ride an explosion into the night?</p>
<p>Without the ion drive, I was drifting. Even drifting, I was traveling at what would have been a breakneck pace in an atmosphere. In the cold emptiness of space, there was no way to judge just how fast I was going.</p>
<p>And soon, I would be moving much, much faster.</p>
<hr />
<p>The general idea behind the Alcubierre is deceptively simple. Nothing can move faster than the speed of light. Einstein discovered that particular wrinkle centuries ago and it was as true now as it was then.</p>
<p>But there was a catch: nothing can move faster than the speed of light. But you don't have to.</p>
<p>Space itself would.</p>
<p>Short version: space is flexible. It can expand and contract, most often under the influence of gravitational fields. What's more, said expansions can move faster than the speed of light, seeing as, strictly speaking, nothing was moving.</p>
<p>I'll admit, the idea still seemed odd to me when I thought about it too carefully. But essentially, that was the idea. Using physics well beyond my own understanding, the Alcubierre drive created a wave in the fabric of space itself.</p>
<p>That was me. A cosmic surfer. The second human being in history to ride a space bubble to the edge of the solar system.</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm not sure why I imagined that the reality of the Alcubierre drive would be any different from the simulators.</p>
<p>Despite that fact that I was traveling just shy of a hundred times the speed of light, as far as I could tell I might as well have been standing still.</p>
<p>The moment the Alcubierre drive had engaged, the stars had gone out. It was a curious side effect of the Alcubierre field that light tends to slide along the sides of the field, colliding in a faint wake on the far side. I'm told it's for the best: even the light of a star can be blinding when you're colliding with a hundred times as many photons per second.</p>
<p>Still, it's disconcerting.</p>
<p>Now that the drive was engaged, I had only to wait.</p>
<p>162 seconds.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>5 billion kilometers, and I'd be there in less than three minutes.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that it should have been me out there and Marshall flying to <em>my</em> rescue, I had to admit... That was pretty cool.</p>
<hr />
<p>With fifteen seconds to go, I could feel my heart rate picking up. Based on Marshall's reports and what little long range telemetry mission control had received, this is when the Prometheus' Alcubierre ring had failed. When collapsing the wave and returning space to its normal configuration.</p>
<p>The engineers on the project claimed they had found the issue. An instability in the equations governing the turbulence of quantum foam stirred up by the collapse of an Alcubierre field. Or something like that. It was something that hadn't come up in years of automated testing, so the chances of it happening twice in a row were essentially nil.</p>
<p>At least that was what they said.</p>
<p>They also claimed that they'd tweaked the timing. Collapse the field a fraction of a second more slowly and the turbulence would be directed perpendicular to the ring, rather than directly into.</p>
<p>Personally, I thought that was something they should have thought of before sending the first ship. But what do I know?</p>
<p>Ten seconds. Was this it? Was this the moment when I became the second person in the history of the human race to set eyes directly on Pluto?</p>
<p>Nine.</p>
<p>Eight. A slight vibration echoed through my seat. Something that had never come up in the simulation.</p>
<p>Seven.</p>
<p>Six.</p>
<p>Five. The vibration was back, hard enough up and down that I could hear my own teeth rattling together.</p>
<p>Nothing I could do about it now. If I didn't shut down the Alcubierre drive, there was no telling where I would end up. Two weeks and I could be at Alpha Centauri--if that was the way I was facing.</p>
<p>I wish I'd thought to look that up before I left.</p>
<p>Four.</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>Two. I shut my eyes.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<hr />
<p>Gradually, I became aware of a sound.</p>
<p>My eyes were still squeezed shut. I found in that moment that I didn't want to know. I didn't want to know if I was to be the hero who rescued the first Alcubierre test pilot or only its second victim.</p>
<p>But there was a sound in my cockpit, a sound that I recognized.</p>
<p>"Carter? That you?"</p>
<p>Marshall. I'd talked to him less than a week ago, at his going away celebration. It was a bittersweet moment, knowing that--unless something went horribly wrong--he was going to be taking my spot in history. But I had to be happy for him. After all, if something <em>did</em> go horribly wrong, I couldn't be too happy about it. Too suspicious.</p>
<p>Slowly, I opened my eyes. Scanned the control screen.</p>
<p>A few numbers were on the high side, but all well within parameters.</p>
<p>I glanced out the viewports.</p>
<p>The Alcubierre ring. Solid. Unbroken.</p>
<p>I let out a breath I hadn't known I'd been holding.</p>
<p>"Ha," I cried out, "Take that, Einstein."</p>
<p>What can I say? At least it was better than 'oh shit.'</p>
<hr />
<p>It took the better part of six hours to match velocity with the Prometheus and link the two ships.</p>
<p>Marshall was going to have to abandon his ship. For the moment, only the Atlas would be going home. Theoretically, it would be possible to Alcubierre field to move both ships, even linked together as they were now. It wasn't like they were actually moving after all.</p>
<p>But that had been deemed too much a risk by the powers that be. 'Bring him home,' they'd said. There would be other missions. Prove that the technology works and the stars were quite literally the limit.</p>
<p>The ride home was cramped but uneventful. Both the Promethus and the Atlas were designed with a second seat just behind the pilot's for incidents exactly such as this--well, not exactly, but you get the drift. That doesn't mean it's particularly comfortable.</p>
<p>The same as the way back, it only took 160 seconds to return to Earth orbit. Of course, that was after six hours to link, another for the spacewalk, and two more on top of that for the Atlas' computer to calculate the proper trajectory home.</p>
<p>That's one of the problems with moving so fast--if you're off by even a little, you can easily end up thousands of millions from the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>But we made it, and in the end, that's all that's important. We'd done it. We'd taken an unbreakable law of nature and gone right around it. The stars were open to us, to all of humanity.</p>
<p>And I was part of the story.</p>
<p>Second place.</p>
<p>But hey, I got to be the hero. Perhaps second place isn't so bad after all.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Backing up GitHub repositories</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/08/backing-up-github-repositories" /><id>urn:uuid:1441231b-25d9-0022-7eb4-23a4966e0f50</id><updated>2015-09-08T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The newest chapter in my quest to collect entirely too much data / back up All The Things!: GitHub.</p>

<p>Basically, I want to back up all of my own personal GitHub repositories along with any from organizations that I am involved with. Strictly speaking, this is a little strange, since it's unlikely that GitHub is going anywhere soon and, if it does, we are likely to have fair warning. But still, it's nice to have a local copy just in case GitHub is down.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The code is actually really straight forward. Most of the heavy lifting is being done by the <a href="https://github.com/copitux/python-github3">pygithub3</a> library. One caveat: it's a little strange to install. In my case, I had to first install <code>pygithub</code> and then <code>pygithub3</code> in order to satisfy a missing dependency (<a href="https://github.com/copitux/python-github3/issues/41">previously reported</a>).</p>
<p>After that, you can authenticate to GitHub, get a list of repositories, and download them all:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import pygithub3
import os

# Load a list of repos we don't want to download / update
ignored = set()
if os.path.exists('ignore.txt'):
    with open('ignore.txt', 'r') as fin:
        for line in fin:
            ignored.add(line.strip())

# Connect to github (if you have MFA, your password must be a token)
gh = pygithub3.Github(os.environ['GITHUB_USERNAME'], os.environ['GITHUB_PASSWORD'])

# Loop over repos for the specified user, this will include their organization's repos as well
for repo in gh.get_user().get_repos():

    remote_path = repo.ssh_url
    size = repo.size
    owner = repo.owner.login
    name = repo.name
    name_with_owner = '{owner}/{name}'.format(owner = owner, name = name)
    print(name_with_owner)

    # Check if the repo is in the ignore list
    if name in ignored or name_with_owner in ignored:
        print('... skipping')
        continue

    # Build up a list of commands that will be run for the given repo
    local_path = os.path.join('repos', owner, name)
    cmds = ['mkdir -p repos/{owner}; cd repos/{owner}'.format(owner = owner)]

    # Already exists, update it
    if os.path.exists(local_path):
        print('... updating')
        cmds += [
            'cd {name}'.format(name = name),
            'git pull --rebase --prune',                 # Update to the most recent master
            'git submodule update --init --recursive',   # Update submodules
        ]
    # Doesn't exist yet, clone it
    else:
        print('... cloning')
        cmds += [
            'git clone {url}'.format(url = remote_path), # Download a new clean copy using repo name as directory
            'cd {name}'.format(name = name),
            'git submodule update --init --recursive',   # Download and update submodules
        ]

    # Run each command specified above, bailing out if any failed (&&)
    cmds = ' && '.join(cmds)
    os.system(cmds)
    print()</code></pre>
<p>Basically, we're going to run a sequence of commands depending on if the repo was previously checked out or not. If it hasn't been (this is the first time), we want to run:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>git clone {url}</code></li>
    <li><code>cd {name}</code></li>
    <li><code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This will get the initial version and any submodules. I'm not sure that I'm going to keep the submodule code around, but in interest of keeping everything in a runnable state even if GitHub were to vanish tomorrow, it seemed a good idea.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if we want to update a previously cloned repo:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>cd {name}</code></li>
    <li><code>git pull --rebase --prune</code></li>
    <li><code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This is much the same, it just pulls any new code first.</p>
<p>And that's it. It took a little while to pull all of my repositories down (I have about 15 GB all told, counting various private repositories from work and my university days (which I still help to maintain)), but that's only necessary the first time. After that, it's much quicker.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Writing Excuses prompt: Walking through a scene (Part 3)</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/07/writing-excuses-prompt-walking-through-a-scene-part-3" /><id>urn:uuid:0b8d28b5-8b4b-0a9e-56c4-35638720c4ad</id><updated>2015-09-07T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/2015/01/25/writing-excuses-10-4-qa-on-ideas/">Writing Excuses 10.5</a> writing prompt</strong>: <em>Take three different characters and walk them through a scene.

<p>The market is not a place in which I usually find myself.</p>
<p>It is noisy and rife with chaos, the throngs pressing into one another all along the way.</p>
<p>Yet today I find myself in unusual circumstances, descending into those very same masses.</p>

<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>Night before last, I received a most unusual package, dropped upon my doorstop with nary so much as note or notice. Not even a courier, one whom I could ask from where the package originated.</p>
<p>It was a simple box, as white as new fallen snow, with a thin red line running around the summit of the sides. Neither a style nor material to which I was accustomed.</p>
<p>At my word, my manservant Johanas sliced the box across the top in a single smooth motion, lifting two thick flaps to either side so that I might gaze at the contents therein.</p>
<p>Imagine then my surprise, when inside of the box I found but three smaller packages, each in a more traditional brown wrapping paper, tied with a piece of twine and sealed with wax. Lying on top of the three of them, a piece of thick parchment, waxy to the touch.</p>
<p>Said letter contained only three lines, in a thin spidery hand I had never before seen:</p>
<p><em>Deliver to Temple of Acbris before sunfall, three days hence</em></p>
<p><em>Failure to comply and your indiscretions shall become common knowledge</em></p>
<p><em>Do not send Johanas. Go yourself.</em></p>
<p>It was unsigned, the only identifying mark a curving line, two figures inside of one another, like an arrow in flight.</p>
<p>Imagine, a Lord of the House of Sarane being treated in such a manner.</p>
<p>Yet the mysterious author of the note knew too much. Knowing that dear Johanas would be the one with me when I opened the package; Johanas, who I of course would have been inclined to dispatch in my stead.</p>
<p>And my ... indiscretions.</p>
<p>Yes. I of course would have to send the packages.</p>
<p>But one never said that I would have to carry all three.</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>For the first of the three, I hired a child of the street. I saw immediately from the look on his face that he would do his job and return. And all for a pair of silver marks. Pocket change.</p>
<p>The second, I handed to a golem. Dependable lot that. More expensive than the child, but dependable. The letter had been unclear on what would be the outcome were only one or two of the packages delivered.</p>
<p>The last, I took myself.</p>
<p>I had a carriage of course, pulled by a pair of mechanical steeds. Johanas drove, at my insistence. The letter had said that I must go myself, but who else might I trust to this endeavor?</p>
<p>There was only a momentary pause, halfway across the market. A crunching sound and a few quick screams. I called out to Johanas, asking what might be the matter, but he said only not to worry, that he would have me on my way in no time and all. And off we went, true to his word.</p>
<p>At the far end of the market, I for a moment considered handing Johanas the package to place at the foot of the pyre, rather than risking my own person. I had come this far; I would see it through.</p>
<p>And then it was done.</p>
<p>We parked the carriage off down the block, to allow Johanas a vantage point by which to observe the other two deliveries. He claims the boy made it first, placing his package without a second glance.</p>
<p>Then the golem, a few minutes later.</p>
<p>That surprised me somewhat, I must admit, that the young lad could outrun the steady determination of a golem. Johanas assured me though, that both packages were delivered in excellent form, joining my own.</p>
<p>And now I must hope only that the mysterious author of the letter too keeps his word. If not, well... Then perhaps I will ask Johanas to find them. Teach them precisely the meaning of the word indiscretion.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Writing Excuses prompt: Walking through a scene (Part 2)</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/05/writing-excuses-prompt-walking-through-a-scene-part-2" /><id>urn:uuid:4a42e60a-1dd4-b037-afbc-d82b26973e9b</id><updated>2015-09-05T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/2015/01/25/writing-excuses-10-4-qa-on-ideas/">Writing Excuses 10.5</a> writing prompt</strong>: <em>Take three different characters and walk them through a scene.

<p>The man that gave me the box wasn't a very good man. He was tall and skinny and he smelled. But he gave me a shiny silver penny and said that if I took this box to the other end of the market and came back, he could would give me another.</p>
<p>Two shiny silver pennies?</p>
<p>All for taking a stupid little box across the street.</p>
<p>The market is busy. Busy means pockets and pockets mean pennies and pennies mean dinner.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>But if I don't hafta steal to get dinner, then that's okay too. People don't come after you if you don't steal so much.</p>
<p>No one looks at me. It's like they don't even see me, even though I'm the tallest of Talitha's crew. Well, except for Talitha herself. But she's old. 20 years at least, that's ancient.</p>
<p>Halfway across the square, there's a ruckus. One of those metal men has fallen down and lost his head.</p>
<p>I stop and laugh, but only for a moment.</p>
<p>It's not polite to laugh at stranger's misfortune. And you have to be polite not to get caught. Talitha says.</p>
<p>But it's funny. The metal men are everywhere now. Not like it used to be. Back when I was still small. Back then, the metal men were only in the rich parts of town.</p>
<p>The metal men are no fun. No pockets. No purses. No pennies.</p>
<p>The metal man isn't interesting though. He just lays there. He has a box too. It looks like my box. But the smelly man didn't say that there would be any other boxes.</p>
<p>Would would a metal man want with a penny anyway?</p>
<p>I start walking again. I really wanted to get the silver penny that the smelly man had already given me out of my pocket. There were things you could only do with the lighter silver pennies.</p>
<p>But then the other boys would see. They might come and take my penny away. Talitha wouldn't be happy then; she said that if I got beat up again, that was it. I was done.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what exactly I would be done with, but it didn't sound good.</p>
<p>I liked my job.</p>
<p>I started again, only to feel a sudden pain in my foot. I'd kicked something.</p>
<p>I looked down and jumped up, all at the same time.</p>
<p>The thing I kicked? It was the metal man's head.</p>
<p>How did that get over here?</p>
<p>It was staring at me with those gemstone eyes. They weren't right though. Normally those eyes never stop moving. The metal men don't have to eat, they don't have to sleep. They cut right into our pickpocketing they did when they started policing the market.</p>
<p>But this one didn't seem much interested in me. All laying there, a head without a body, it didn't seem to be reacting at all.</p>
<p>Was the metal man dead?</p>
<p>I never really thought about that. If they moved around and walked and talked, I guess that meant they were alive. And if they were alive, well then I guess this one could just possibly be dead.</p>
<p>So he won't be needing those eyes.</p>
<p>I took it.</p>
<p>The head I mean.</p>
<p>It was heavier than I expected.</p>
<p>It mean, it was metal, right? But it was heavier than my own head. And the metal men never seemed to mind. And it was shiny.</p>
<p>It wasn't too bad.</p>
<p>I could do this.</p>
<p>Luckily, no one seemed to notice that I'd taken it. In fact, they all seemed to be very careful not to notice anything that was going on.</p>
<p>People don't notice things they don't want to. Talitha always said that.</p>
<p>The rest of the way, there were other metal men. They weren't helping the one that broke. I guess the metal men are just like people after all.</p>
<p>There was a fire at the end of the market. I left the box by the fire.</p>
<p>There was another box, just like mine.</p>
<p>Two shiny silver pennies for them, two shiny silver pennies for me.</p>
<p>They don't have a shiny metal head though.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Writing Excuses prompt: Walking through a scene (Part 1)</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/04/writing-excuses-prompt-walking-through-a-scene-part-1" /><id>urn:uuid:4f19d08b-7c08-c4a3-f44f-90d04df15921</id><updated>2015-09-04T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I didn't last nearly as long as I'd hoped with the <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/writing-excuses">Writing Excuses</a> prompts.

<hr />
<p>There are certain advantages that come with being dead. When walking down the street, people tend to give you a wide berth.</p>
<p>People don't want to be reminded of their own mortality.</p>
<p>People don't want to be reminded that death is no longer the end.</p>
<p>My target was on the other end of the marketplace, on the front steps of the temple to Acbris, God of the Sun. Ironic, all things considered.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I was to take my package--a small thing, wrapped in brown paper--and leave it around the massive brazier that was never allowed to go out. To the casual observer, it would seem an offering like any other. Something to be tossed in by the temple priests whenever the fires began to dim even slightly.</p>
<p>At first, I had worried about that. If the package wasn't picked up in time, would it not be thrown into the flames? What good would that do anyone?</p>
<p>But it didn't matter. I was being paid handsomely for no more than a half hour's walk across the market place. The price was more than enough to account for the stares.</p>
<p>Lost in my thoughts, I had no time to respond when the cart came barreling out of an alleyway directly into my path. It was huge, pulled by a team of four mechanical horses, two by two, each snorting and steaming as they reared up in a vain attempt to slow themselves.</p>
<p>The horses smashed into me, the first two knocking me to the ground, and the next two crushing my steel chest. If I had still been alive, that would have killed me. But instead, it didn't even hurt. I could no longer feel pain. Finally, the cart hit me. I felt the impact, although if that was a true response or a memory of what I had once been, I couldn't say.</p>
<p>I saw my chest bending, a long dent running from side to side. I heard a scream of steel as it bent, further and further. Something had to give, and give it did. Unfortunately, the part that gave was my head.</p>
<p>There was a hiss of steam as my head popped off and went rolling across the street. A spray of tiny golden gears spilled out from my neck.</p>
<p>For several long moments, I just lay there.</p>
<p>It had been such a simple job. Just walk across the market and drop off the package. Now I couldn't even tell for sure where the package was, let alone finish the job.</p>
<p>I felt the crystal core, deep in my chest, just as it always was. A miracle of science and magic both, the crystalline structure was exactly how I was able to bind my spirit--all that was left of who I had once been--to the golem's body. I couldn't begin to explain how it worked.</p>
<p>While I lay there, trying to figure out what to do next, a small child walked up to me. In a single quick motion, he bent down and stole my head.</p>
<p>I couldn't believe it. When I first saw the little street rat, I felt bad for him. The city had a problem with orphans, everyone knew that. What circumstances had led him to a life on the street?</p>
<p>When he'd stopped, I sorely wished I still had the ability to speak. But that was one of the conditions of my resurrection. It wasn't that they <em>coudn't</em> give golems a voice--but rather that the guild didn't trust us not to tell anyone exactly what we were. Even with the Geas, they didn't trust us not to go back to our former families and spill their one great secret.</p>
<p>Then he reached down for my head and I thought I wouldn't have to. That he would do the right thing.</p>
<p><em>Just put it back in place,</em> I mentally ordered.</p>
<p>But the little jerk just took it and ran.</p>
<p>I lay there, dumbfounded, for what felt like ages.</p>
<p>I couldn't really blame him. Not really. He was probably starving. Living on the street. I'm sure he didn't have any family or probably even a home to go back to. It was one of the problems that had gotten significantly worse since The Baron had come to power. That and the armies of new golems being pressed into service. I was one of them.</p>
<p>A detail flashed into my mind. In the confusion of losing my head, I missed it at first.</p>
<p>The boy had been carrying a package.</p>
<p>One that looked an awful lot like my own.</p>
<p>I turned within my golem shell, trying to find my own package. It took a moment, but I found it, only a hair away from my outstretched hand.</p>
<p>Well, that was something at least.</p>
<p>With a mental sigh--I no longer possessed either the lungs or the mouth for anything more--I heaved myself to my feet, package in hand. It was an unusual feeling. My body felt off balance and one arm and leg were not quite working correctly. But I could get to my feet and that was enough. If I even hoped to be able to afford a new head, I needed to deliver that package.</p>
<p>One step.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>My left leg was no longer bending at the knee and the right was rattling. When all was said and done, I was going to need more than just a new head.</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>Four.</p>
<p>The others in the square gave me an even wider burden. I was no longer merely a shade, but now a headless golem as well. Even if one understood in their mind that a golem did not need a head to function, it was still an unsettling sight.</p>
<p>Five.</p>
<p>Six.</p>
<p>I settled into the new rhythm. Right leg rattles, left leg drags. Right leg rattles...</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was there.</p>
<p>The fires at the temple to Acbris. And lying just beside the fire, two identical packages to the one I held in one hand.</p>
<p>I watched them for a moment. Not only the boy, but a third courier as well? Someone really wanted this package delivered.</p>
<p>But that was not my concern.</p>
<p>I had done my job. Now I could return to my berth and salvage what I could of my arms and legs. With any luck, this one delivery wouldn't send me even further into debt.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Using a Microsoft keyboard with a Mac</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/03/using-a-microsoft-keyboard-with-a-mac" /><id>urn:uuid:fdb332af-f326-0e82-0f0d-112e98e90ed9</id><updated>2015-09-03T14:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I use a MacBook at work.

So instead, I've been using a <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Microsoft-Natural-Ergonomic-Keyboard-4000/dp/B000A6PPOK/">Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard</a>. Then though, you have the difference between Control/Windows/Alt keys and Control/Option/Command.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First option, tweak the built in OS X keyboard settings:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/03/using-a-microsoft-keyboard-with-a-mac/keyboard-settings.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/03/using-a-microsoft-keyboard-with-a-mac/keyboard-settings.png" /></a></p>
<p>You have to make sure to choose the correct keyboard at the top, but once you have done so you can switch the Option and Command keys without problem (OS X thinks that Alt/Option is one key and the Windows key is Command). The downside to this solution is that every time you unplug the keyboard, the settings are removed. It looks like this has been a problem for <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2364069?threadID=2364069&tstart=0">a while...</a> So instead, we'll turn to third party tools.</p>
<p>Enter: <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">Karabiner</a>. So far as keyboard options, it has everything and the kitchen sink. There are <em>far</em> more options than the previous version (KeyRemap4MacBook). Long story short, these are the three options that I was looking for:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/03/using-a-microsoft-keyboard-with-a-mac/karabiner-settings.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/03/using-a-microsoft-keyboard-with-a-mac/karabiner-settings.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
    <li>Don't remap an internal keyboard - Change only the Microsoft keyboard, leave the Mac keyboard alone</li>
    <li>Command_L to Option_L (and vice versa) - swap the command and option keys (I never use the right side, although there are two more options to swap those)</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's it. It's been working great, persisting through reboot (you have to enable it in the Users &amp; Groups > Login Items settings page) and unplugging the keyboard. If only OS X had this functionality built in...</p>
<p>Bonus round:</p>
<p>I user a drop down terminal (<a href="http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/">TotalTerminal</a>) all of the time. It's great for productivity, since I switch between the console and applications all of the time. For the keyboard shortcut, I want to use the Caps Lock key (who actually uses that to write in all caps?). Unfortunately, you cannot use the Caps Lock key directly. Enter <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en">Seil</a>, a sibling application to Karabiner (although why they're not unified is unclear):</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/03/using-a-microsoft-keyboard-with-a-mac/seil-settings.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/03/using-a-microsoft-keyboard-with-a-mac/seil-settings.png" /></a></p>
<p>Change that one option (80 is F19, a key unlikely to be used by anything else; there's a list further down) and you're golden.</p>
<p>Edit: Ah ha. What I really wanted was to map my terminal to Caps Lock + A (so that I can use other keys for other applications in the future). I can map Caps Lock to Control, Option, or Command, so I have a few options:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Control-A: Suboptimal, since Control-A is already used to go to the beginning of the line</li>
    <li>Option-A: Since I'm remapping Option/Command, this will behave differently on the internal and external keyboard</li>
    <li>Command-A: Used to select all text, so that doesn't work</li>
</ul>
<p>Not so great.</p>
<p>Luckily, we do have an option. Remember how I was only mapping the <em>left</em> Control and Options earlier? We can use the right side! If we tell Seil to map Caps Lock to 61 (Right Option) and tell TotalTerminal to open on Option+A, that will do exactly what I expect on both the internal and external keyboard.</p>
<p>Victory!</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>The Iron Wyrm Affair</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/01/the-iron-wyrm-affair" /><id>urn:uuid:d1140414-f3b3-8ae2-b3cf-4c60713d0392</id><updated>2015-09-01T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12899734-the-iron-wyrm-affair"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/01/the-iron-wyrm-affair/the-iron-wyrm-affair.jpg" /></a></p>

<!--more-->
<p>Main problems:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There are <em>Proper Nouns</em> all over the place, but they're only rarely explained until much later (if at all). Some books can get away with this. This one did not.
    <li>The POV jumps from character to character and in some cases it can take a while to figure out who in the world is talking.</li>
    <li>Bannon (main character) is crazy powerful. Again, sometimes you can have a story start with a very powerful protagonist and go from there, but more often than not it doesn't work out.</li>
    <li>Clare (apparently supposed to be a main character) never really feels like a main character. He's badly overshadowed by Bannon and one of her Shields, to the point where I'm not sure why the series isn't titled Bannon and Mikal.</li>
    <li>Holy purple prose Batman. The wording feels accurate for the period (so far as I know, which I don't), but the fact that I noticed enough to comment on it isn't great. Also Bannon mentions over and over again how unladylike she's being. We get it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upsides:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Some of the descriptions were very cool. Counter to the last point above, I really could see what was going on in some of the scenes. Not necessarily why it was happening and I'm sure I got some of the <em>Proper Nouns</em> wrong, but it was still solid.</li>
    <li>There is a lot of neat worldbuilding just beneath the surface. I wish it was more obvious, but it's always interesting to read alternate history at this level. I want to know how things changed! I want to know how things work! Usually that wanting will drive me kicking and screaming through a story (in the best way possible). It almost did this time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to the point I made a little while back for Whitechapel Gods and <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/25/his-majestys-dragon">His Majesty's Dragon</a>. I'm sure there are loads of people who love this kind of story. I'm not one of them.</p>
<p>So it goes.</p>]]></content></entry></feed>
