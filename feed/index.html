&lt;p>The Wheel of Time turns, and ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of time. But it was a beginning.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/23/the-wheel-of-time-season-1/">The Wheel of Time: Season 1&lt;/a> had a lot of potential&amp;hellip; and also a lot of issues. Especially when it came to the last couple episodes. COVID, sure. A main actor leaving, I get it. But it&amp;rsquo;s still a rough ending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it was with cautious optimism, we approached Season 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s very much a new turning of the wheel. Some things they changed really do work well. It&amp;rsquo;s not the books, but it&amp;rsquo;s a new story in the same world. Some&amp;hellip; less so. But not everything is perfect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things I loved:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The casting. Ishamael was great in Season 1 and even better in Season 2. Lanfear is a great counter to him. Aviendha and Elayne fit really well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It bears repeating: Ishamael and Lanfear are great. Leaning a bit more into terrifying even than the books, which quite frankly they needed. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see (and hope they don&amp;rsquo;t screw up&amp;hellip;) the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Almost&lt;/em> everything about the Seanchan. They feel &amp;lsquo;off&amp;rsquo; in just the right way. The one exception&amp;hellip; the Damane pacifiers. I really don&amp;rsquo;t get that &lt;em>at all&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Liandrin. She&amp;rsquo;s still terrible, but I really like how they turned up the &lt;em>reason&lt;/em> why she is as she is. And she&amp;rsquo;s quite the actor to pull it off.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Things that I did not:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The ending. Check out the &lt;a href="#8-what-was-meant-to-be">individual review&lt;/a> for more details, but &amp;hellip; this wasn&amp;rsquo;t any better than the previous season. And they don&amp;rsquo;t even have unexpected troubles to deal with. I&amp;rsquo;m starting to feel they really just don&amp;rsquo;t know how to write endings&amp;hellip; which is weird.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Anyways, other than a few things, I quite enjoyed it. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to Season 3. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 4: Crimson Reign</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/09/darth-vader-vol.-4-crimson-reign/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/09/darth-vader-vol.-4-crimson-reign/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v4-textbundle-6d8ec1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So forget Luke and Han Vader is apparently going after this Crimson Dawn now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v4-textbundle-99b49e.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They’re everywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Should be right up Vader’s alley.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add to that the return of Sabe. It’s an unexpectedly interesting way to tie into Vader’s past. One just had to wonder if/&lt;em>when&lt;/em> she’ll learn the truth of Vader’s identity…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still not quite as good as the first two volumes but an enjoyable read nevertheless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On thing I particularly enjoy about the comics is just how varied and alien the universe can feel:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v4-textbundle-5f40a5.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a nice contrast to how human centric the movies and shows have to be. Easier to draw a bug/lizard/ten foot ball droid than to put them on film.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 3: War of the Bounty Hunters</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/darth-vader-vol.-3-war-of-the-bounty-hunters/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/darth-vader-vol.-3-war-of-the-bounty-hunters/</guid><description>&lt;p>Vader is after Solo now…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v3-textbundle-a96877.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With some interesting “allies”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus an appearance by the one and only (I assume) IG-88!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Coolest part:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v3-textbundle-e568a4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vader getting &lt;del>hacked&lt;/del> sliced! He’s ‘more machine now than man’ so it fits. They could have done so much more with it…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The introduction (for me at least) of the Crimson Dawn is interesting as well. A Million Stronger than One. A neat idea to contrast the ‘only two there are’ Sith and the Big Damn Heroes of the Rebellion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit more out there than the previous two volumes but I enjoyed it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Raven Cursed</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/raven-cursed/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/08/raven-cursed/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“What you did today was self-defense. That man’s death might provide short-term protection for my brother, my master, and me. And so I thank you for the sacrifice of a small piece of your soul.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Jane is still up to here in Vampire politics&amp;ndash;with the complications of Witches and Weres for good measure. But at least now, she&amp;rsquo;s back home in North Carolina. That&amp;rsquo;s got to be worth something&amp;hellip; right?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 2: Into the Fire</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/06/darth-vader-vol.-2-into-the-fire/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/06/darth-vader-vol.-2-into-the-fire/</guid><description>&lt;p>Vader learned Luke was his son… and ran off across the Galaxy, tracking down anyone he could that might have hidden the truth from him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v2-textbundle-a28ead.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Emperor was not thrilled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So he tears Vader apart over again, sends him back to Mustafar (planet of his both in a way), and forbids him the force.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things only get more epic from here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a whirlwind of Vader passing test after trial, showing off just why he’s one of the most powerful beings in the Galaxy. Until we return to Exegol—2 years after the Rise of Skywalker; trying to fill in some of the mess that one made of continuity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vader is a weird choice for a protagonist, but likewise weirdly compelling. He is (at this point) unabashedly evil, yet I find myself rooting for him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darth Vader, Vol. 1: Dark Heart of the Sith</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/05/darth-vader-vol.-1-dark-heart-of-the-sith/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/05/darth-vader-vol.-1-dark-heart-of-the-sith/</guid><description>&lt;p>Darth Vader, shortly after Luke escapes him in The Empire Strikes Back. Realizing that perhaps he doesn’t actually &lt;em>know&lt;/em> what happened to Padme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Off to trawl through the past. With… quite the droid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/darth-vader-2020-v1-textbundle-108da3.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a fascinating look into Vader forced to dig into Anakin’s past. On Tattoine. On—and under—Naboo. Work the Handmaidens and other from Padme’s life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fascinating mix. I’m curious where it goes next!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: I can’t imagine reading these issue by issue… dang that’s a cliffhanger in issue 1…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dead Man Logan, Vol. 2: Welcome Back, Logan</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/04/dead-man-logan-vol.-2-welcome-back-logan/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/10/04/dead-man-logan-vol.-2-welcome-back-logan/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it ends as it began.

&lt;p>“Crows remember human faces. They remember the people who feed them, who are kind to them. And the people who wrong them too. They don’t forget. They tell each other who to look after and who to watch out for.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/">Six of Crows&lt;/a> took the world of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> and instead gave us one heck of a heist book. Really, it all circled around one big, impossible heist. Plan everything, get in, plans fall apart, make new plans, and pull off the impossible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s one heck of an impressive book and I really enjoyed it, but it left an awful lot of plot thread hanging open&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which makes Crooked Kingdom all the more cathartic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Six of Crows</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/27/six-of-crows/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>No mourners.&lt;br>
No funerals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Among them, it passed for &amp;lsquo;good luck.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s such a good book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It takes the world of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> and completely ignores the at times overly YA political and religions machinations of that particular trilogy in favor of a somewhat darker and grittier heist novel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the most part, you really don&amp;rsquo;t need to have read Shadow and Bone first. There are a few references to the &amp;lsquo;Ravkan Civil War&amp;rsquo; and even to Sankta Alina, but other than that, it&amp;rsquo;s a new world. There are still Grisha, but they&amp;rsquo;re far less &amp;lsquo;miliary&amp;rsquo;, instead using (and hiding) their powers in all manner of interesting ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And while the heist elements were &lt;em>strong&lt;/em> (an impossible job, planning going absolutely sideways, and double triple crossing left and right) we also get all sorts of interesting backstory. Each of the main characters has chapters in their voice, but in the action going now, and explaining how they got into this mess in the first place. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot, but in a good way!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One gotcha is that, while the main heist plot is more than adequately contained in the book, it very much is the first half of a duology. It managed to just make me want to read the second&amp;hellip; but don&amp;rsquo;t go into this looking for a stand alone novel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what really shines are the characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dead Man Logan, Vol. 1: Sins of the Father</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/26/dead-man-logan-vol.-1-sins-of-the-father/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/26/dead-man-logan-vol.-1-sins-of-the-father/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so he has an expiration date:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Downton Abbey Season 6 is a strange beast. On one hand, we have what feels all the cast pairing off, sometimes with long known relationships and in the cast of the Family with guys we only met in the previous season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For what it&amp;rsquo;s worth, I &lt;em>still&lt;/em> do not really understand the relationship between Mary and Henry. I think it&amp;rsquo;s mostly Mary. She certainly ebbs and flows&amp;hellip; but wow she&amp;rsquo;s a (sorry, but Edith says it too) bitch at times. On the other hand, Edith and Bertie? Delightful. If expected for the chaos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, the world is moving on. Is Downton Abbey going to survive? With reductions in expected staff and families around the world failing, it&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But with all those relationships &lt;em>wow&lt;/em> do the last few episodes blitz through what feels like every plotline possible in only a few hours. I do wonder if they thought they&amp;rsquo;d have a 7th season. But so it goes. For the most part, everything is tied off neatly. And for everything else&amp;hellip; apparently there are two movies?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a final note, if you&amp;rsquo;ve been lamenting the torture the writers have put the Bates&amp;rsquo; through over the year&amp;hellip; well, they&amp;rsquo;re not quite done. But there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad for that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I quite enjoyed it. Much more than I expected to, as I seem to say with all non-SF/F shows I end up watching. Still not something I would have chosen, still quite enjoyable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Betsy-Tacy and Tib</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/25/betsy-tacy-and-tib/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 20:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/25/betsy-tacy-and-tib/</guid><description>&lt;p>Betsy-Tacy and Tib is &amp;hellip; pretty much exactly what you&amp;rsquo;d expect. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/05/betsy-tacy/">Betsy-Tacy&lt;/a>, but now with more Tib. A new girl moves in, they become instant best friends, hijinks ensue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once again, it&amp;rsquo;s a delightful book to read with my own little one. I enjoy seeing what messes the children get into. And although they do get in trouble from time to time, we&amp;rsquo;re reminded that &lt;em>it&amp;rsquo;s okay to be children&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: my absolute favorite story is when they decide to cook.

After &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> set the stage and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/19/siege-and-storm/">Siege and Storm&lt;/a> raised the stakes, Ruin and Rising really brings everything home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have the increasing religious fever of Alina as Saint&amp;ndash;whether or not that&amp;rsquo;s what she wants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have what&amp;rsquo;s left of Alina&amp;rsquo;s friends and allies trying desperately to hold off the ever more powerful&amp;ndash;and ever more unhinged&amp;ndash;Darkling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We finally get some real history, digging deeper into where the Darkling came from&amp;hellip; and perhaps how Alina fits into it all as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have more adventures; a desperate bid to find the third Amplifier that may well save the day&amp;ndash;or doom them all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally&amp;ndash;obvious seeing as it&amp;rsquo;s the final novel in the trilogy&amp;ndash;we have victory. But at what cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s by a decent margin my favorite of the three. A solid conclusion, in my opinion. Now I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the other series in the same world. Six of Crows especially to see where those threads in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/25/shadow-and-bone-season-1/">the show&lt;/a> came from and King of Scars for a &amp;lsquo;what comes next&amp;rsquo;.

&lt;p>When people say impossible, they usually mean improbable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> had quite the ending. The Darkling showing his true allegiance, death and destruction, Alina and Mal on the run&amp;hellip; So of course in Siege and Storm they get captured by pirates (&lt;em>cough&lt;/em> I mean &lt;em>privateers&lt;/em>), the Darkling shows up again, they go meet the royal family, the Darkling shows up again, and in the end&amp;hellip; things just keep ending up getting worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s really a solid step up from Shadow and Bone. It&amp;rsquo;s still got a YA core, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely edging on the darker end of it all&amp;ndash;which I really enjoy.

&lt;p>‡ are my favorites, ∿ I listened to the audiobook. Full reviews + all reviews for each author are linked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ &lt;strong>Sequel (HM: Book 3+)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/the-infinite/">The Infinite&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/ada-hoffmann/">Ada Hoffmann&lt;/a>. Sci-fi with post-singularity AI acting as gods and a touch of cosmic horror. Interesting discussions about neurodiversity. My favorite of the series and a solid conclusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Mundane Jobs (Not on Earth)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/12/phoenix-extravagant/">Phoenix Extravagant&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/yoon-ha-lee/">Yoon Ha Lee&lt;/a>. A parallel to the China/Japan conflicts of a century ago and the jobs and sacrifices normal people (esp. artists) have to make during times of war and occupation. Also, Arazi (the dragon on the cover) really sells the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>Published in the 00s (HM: (HM: Not top 30 on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/11mvwsa/rfantasy_top_novels_2023_results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this list&lt;/a>)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/21/throne-of-jade/">Throne of Jade&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/naomi-novik/">Naomi Novik&lt;/a>. What if the Napoleanic Wars, but with DRAGONS. This one now with more travel to China. It&amp;rsquo;s a neat concept and I like throughout the series how the idea is explored in a number of different cultures, although as the series goes on, it starts to wear a bit thin. Temeraire and Laurence (dragon and &amp;hellip; handler? it&amp;rsquo;s complicated) are really the soul of these books. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/temeraire/">Temeraire&lt;/a> is the first book in the series; but I&amp;rsquo;d previously read that years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ &lt;strong>Angels and Demons (HM: Protagonist)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/24/good-omens-the-nice-and-accurate-prophecies-of-agnes-nutter-witch/">Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/neil-gaiman/">Neil Gaiman&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/terry-pratchett/">Terry Pratchett&lt;/a>. A mix of the wonderful worldbuilding of Pratchett and Gaiman that builds on both their strengths to build a fun ride, political/religious in exactly that fun somewhat blasphemous irreverent sort of way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bottom of TBR&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/01/blindsight/">Blindsight&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/peter-watts/">Peter Watts&lt;/a>. Vampires. In Space. It&amp;rsquo;s such a bonkers idea that I want more of it. Plus you get a surprisingly solid scientific reasoning for a lot of Vampire myths, a discussion on AI and the Chinese Room argument, talk about multiple personalities. It&amp;rsquo;s dense and a bit chaotic and weird. I liked it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Horror (HM: Not King or Lovecraft)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/07/prodigal-son/">Prodigal Son&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/dean-koontz/">Dean Koontz&lt;/a>. What if Frankenstein survived into the modern era and tried to conquer the world Invasion of the Frankenbodysnatchers style. It&amp;rsquo;s a solid Dean Koontz book, which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t read in years now. The problem is that it tries to fit far too many threads into one story and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really work without the sequels (and only barely works with them). Another book dealing with autism, dealt with mostly well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ &lt;strong>Coastal or Island Setting (HM: Features Seafaring)&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/19/tress-of-the-emerald-sea/">Tress of the Emerald Sea&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/brandon-sanderson/">Brandon Sanderson&lt;/a>. The feel of Princess Bride told through through the narrative lense of Hoid (which won&amp;rsquo;t make the least bit of sense if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read much of Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s Cosmere I suppose). I&amp;rsquo;ve read and enjoyed just about all of Sanderson and he&amp;rsquo;s got 4 novels out this year, so of course I have to use one of them. It&amp;rsquo;s delightful, touching little story and probably worth a read even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the rest of Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s work, although the ending will be weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>Queernorm Setting (HM: Not Futuristic)&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/03/under-the-whispering-door/">Under the Whispering Door&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/t.j.-klune/">T.J. Klune&lt;/a>. So… what do you call a slice of life story when the protagonist dies at the end of the first chapter? Whatever you do, Under the Whispering Door is a delightful example thereof. Despite taking place within our world, I would say it&amp;rsquo;s Queernorm within the much reduced setting of the story (the tea house and this specific corner of the afterishlife).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Set in the Middle East (HM: By an author of Middle Eastern heritage)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/07/girl-serpent-thorn/">Girl, Serpent, Thorn&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/melissa-bashardoust/">Melissa Bashardoust&lt;/a>. Take Persian mythology and worldbuilding, more than a touch of fairy tale feel, a cursed princess, demons, div (what in a Euro-centric story would be probably be fae), a touch of romance, and the spark of revolution. It’s an interesting world, an interesting premise, and you really want everything to go right in the end. I like the variety of non-humans. They feel the same as dozens of stories I read before–and yet, being based on a different set of myths and legends, different. All at the same time. It’s fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Title with a Title (HM: Not Royalty)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/09/the-handmaids-tale/">The Handmaid&amp;#39;s Tale&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/margaret-atwood/">Margaret Atwood&lt;/a>. Take the extremist end of the American Protestant religious right. Give them everything they want (plus some) over the span of years (if not months). Like any good story of this sort, it takes a potential problem–an idea–and turns it up to eleven. It goes steps further than anything we’ve seen in modern times–or at least differently. And all the more telling when you feel people in today&amp;rsquo;s world taking it as inspiration rather than a cautionary tale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Superheroes (HM: Not DC or Marvel)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/12/zeroes/">Zeroes&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/scott-westerfield/">Scott Westerfield&lt;/a>. The story of six American teenagers who discover they have superpowers. What I like most perhaps was the entire idea of the title: “Zeroes, not Heroes”. They’re not superheroes. (oops, guess it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit after all). I also enjoyed how diverse the cast was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Magical Realism or Literary Fantasy (HM: Not from &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/4bhiua/proposed_magical_realism_recommendation_list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this list&lt;/a>)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/16/the-cartographers/">The Cartographers&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/peng-shepherd/">Peng Shepherd&lt;/a>. Plus side: I love the premise. Take the idea of phantom settlements / copyright traps. Now make it so that if you happen to have the right map–you can actually get to those phantom settlements. I may have to check out Paper Towns. Minus side: it takes forever to actually get to the magic of the book. You (as the reader) are sure there’s more to them than you’d think, either having read the blurb–or just being aware of the book’s genre. But for how magical a concept it is, we barely get anything to do with them until halfway through the book and even then we’re only touching the surface. I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s Magical Realism for you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>Multiverse and Alternate Realities (HM: Not through a literal door)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/18/the-space-between-worlds/">The Space Between Worlds&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/micaiah-johnson/">Micaiah Johnson&lt;/a>. Hopping between worlds–with one big caveat. If you visit a world where another you is still alive, you die. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating digging into the idea that the best world hoppers are those raised under circumstances where they &lt;em>should have died&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Myths and Retellings (HM: Not Greek or Roman)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/23/the-witchs-heart/">The Witch&amp;#39;s Heart&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/genevieve-gornichec/">Genevieve Gornichec&lt;/a>. It seems no matter the culture, myths and legends get weird. Norse mythology is absolutely no exception to that. In this story, we have a novelization of the story of Angrboda. Wife of Loki. Mother of monsters. She’s been around a while (it’s mythology, even she doesn’t know how long) and she just wants to be left alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>Set in Space (HM: Not from Earth)&lt;/strong> (replacing Book Bingo/Readalong): &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/house-of-suns/">House of Suns&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/alastair-reynolds/">Alastair Reynolds&lt;/a>. In House of Suns, we have the story of a small subset of humanity writ large. The speed of light is the ultimate limit. Planets are decades apart; the galaxy hundreds of thousands of years around. So how do you continue that oh so human drive for exploration and expansion? Well in House of Suns, you create a thousand clones. Imprint them all with your memories. And send them out into the universe. Set it up so that ever few decades/centuries/millenia, they meet up, share all they’ve been to. What other branches of humanity have risen–or fallen? What other miracles of technology have been discovered? Who’s fallen in love? Sci-fi at it&amp;rsquo;s finest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Druids (HM: Not Iron Druid)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/13/dreamers-pool/">Dreamer&amp;#39;s Pool&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/juliet-marillier/">Juliet Marillier&lt;/a>. Take a bit of magic/folklore in an oldentimes Ireland; add in a Fae bargain (with all the complications that ensues); combine with a prince and princess who’ve never met outside of letters–and seem entirely different in person; and finish it all off with fairy tale magic of Dreamer’s Pool. It&amp;rsquo;s got an interesting cast and a nice fairy tale sort of plot, if a bit incomplete feeling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Mythical Beasts (HM: Not dragons)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/18/the-last-unicorn/">The Last Unicorn&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/peter-s.-beagle/">Peter S. Beagle&lt;/a>. It’s one of those books that just feels like a fairy tale. An ageless story. A story passed down from long ago ages of myth and fantasy. Ages with heroes and villains and wizards and–you guessed it–unicorns. It’s beautifully written (for the most part; there are certainly parts that feel overdone), chock full of wonderfully fantastic descriptions and metaphors that just sort of stick around. I really enjoy the characters, especially the titular Last Unicorn&amp;ndash;they don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> human; which I appreciate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Featuring Robots (HM: Robot protagonist)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/lock-in/">Lock In&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/john-scalzi/">John Scalzi&lt;/a>. A near future Earth where a flu-like pandemic (Haden’s Syndrome) has caused locked-in syndrome in some small percent of the world’s population (a small percent of billions is still an awful lot of people). Those affected are completely paralyzed, unable to move, while still being fully aware and conscious. Luckily(ish) a massive global effort has figured out how to embed computer hardware in their brains so as to allow them to remotely pilot either robotic bodies (threeps) or (more rarely) other humans who’ve allowed them access. This of course is widely accepted by the rest of humanity and causes no issues whatsoever. It&amp;rsquo;s arguable if the human minds in robotic bodies (the threeps) counts for the square, but if Murderbot counts, I would think this does too? It&amp;rsquo;s their body (although that&amp;rsquo;s a decent plot point in itself).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Novella (HM: Not Tordotcom)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/26/six-gun-snow-white/">Six-Gun Snow White&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/catherynne-m.-valente/">Catherynne M. Valente&lt;/a>. Take (the vague outline) the story of Snow White. Make it a Western. Things get weird. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting premise and certainly an interesting writing style&amp;ndash;although not my favorite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>5 SFF Shorts (HM: An Anthology)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/30/stories-of-your-life-and-others/">Stories of Your Life and Others&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/ted-chiang/">Ted Chiang&lt;/a>. Story of Your Life became the film Arrival, which got me to read the book. The rest are also really good, including some really interesting alternate takes on religion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‡ ∿ &lt;strong>YA (HM: Published in the last 5 years)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/04/a-wizards-guide-to-defensive-baking/">A Wizard&amp;#39;s Guide to Defensive Baking&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/t.-kingfisher/">T. Kingfisher&lt;/a>. A world with weirdly specialized sorts of wizards. You might be able to cast lightning bolts… or you might have the power to animate and converse with dead horses. Or you might even have magical powers over… bread! It’s such a delightful idea and Kingfisher manages to do all sorts of fun things with it. Some obvious (Mongo eat your gingerbread heart out), some less so (Bob the sourdough starter; so delightful). I need to read more Kingfisher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>POC Author (HM: Furturistic Sci/fi)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/06/rosewater/">Rosewater&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/tade-thompson/">Tade Thompson&lt;/a>. A fascinating premise. Take the world a half century in the future. Most things are the same, but there’s a bit more tech floating around, mostly. Introduce a massive alien organism that lands in London and ends up burrowing it’s way to Nigeria. From that alien blob, fill the atmosphere with alien microorganisms/cells that create their own xenosphere, enabling (among other things) psychic powers in some very small proportion of the population. Writ rather more gritty than I was expecting with a complicated structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Self/Indie published (HM: Fewer than 100 ratings)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/10/the-book-of-zog/">The Book of Zog&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/alec-hutson/">Alec Hutson&lt;/a>. Zogrusz is an Eldrich Horror, a being from beyond time and space. But… a nice one? That just wants to do the right thing? It&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly adorable with some interesting cosmic level universebuilding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>∿ &lt;strong>Elemental Magic (HM: Not Shades of Magic or Codex Alera)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/leigh-bardugo/">Leigh Bardugo&lt;/a>. Rather YA and the TV show is better (partially because it pulls from the other series in the same world as well). But I did enjoy the Russian influenced worldbuilding and the slightly more flexible than many YA contemporaries groupings. Has a lot of potential for the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Published in 2023 (HM: Debut)&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/14/the-scourge-between-stars/">The Scourge Between Stars&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/ness-brown/">Ness Brown&lt;/a>. A generation ship with something going bump in the night? Isn&amp;rsquo;t it always night in space? In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s nicely terrifying if rather short (at novella length). Feels &lt;em>very&lt;/em> similar to Alien, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a bad thing. A solid debut.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(I originally read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/29/venco/">VenCo&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/cherie-dimaline/">Cherie Dimaline&lt;/a> for this spot, but realized as I was writing this post that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit hard mode.)&lt;/p>

To get us out of it, we sent a generation ship to the stars. But when we got there&amp;hellip; it wasn&amp;rsquo;t any better, so they turned around to go home. On the way back&amp;hellip; well, we just might not be alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A generation ship is a great setting for a sci-fi/horror mashup. There really is nowhere to run but plenty of places to hide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea of things lurking out there between the stars? Terrifying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The feel of the book, especially as it ratchets up to the big reveal/fight scenes throughout the ship? Excellent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the only real problems I had with the book were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It was too short! Novella length, but the premise alone could certainly fill a novel.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The technology was a bit odd at times (what exactly are they doing with &amp;lsquo;jumps&amp;rsquo;?)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;span class="spoiler">The things in the dark between stars not actually being the monster? Awesome. But... what were they then?&lt;/span>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Worth a read though! A debut author worth following.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Yumi and the Nightmare Painter</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/14/yumi-and-the-nightmare-painter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/14/yumi-and-the-nightmare-painter/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh Sanderson. How &lt;em>do&lt;/em> you do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three of the four novels in the &amp;ldquo;Year of Sanderson&amp;rdquo;. Tress was amazing and if anything&amp;hellip; Yumi is even better. (Frugal Wizard was fine. 😄)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shadow and Bone</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/</guid><description>&lt;p>Browsing through Netflix last fall, I came upon &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/25/shadow-and-bone-season-1/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a>. Watched it. Quite enjoyed it. Figured I should read the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s not bad, but I enjoyed the show more. For one, it pulls in Kaz and co, which don&amp;rsquo;t appear in this novel at all (they&amp;rsquo;re originally from the related Six of Crows books), which is a bummer. For two, the additional dynamic of Alina as half-Shu in addition to being an orphan added rather a lot to her character.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Book of Zog</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/10/the-book-of-zog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/10/the-book-of-zog/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The man scowled, but Zogrusz sensed a slight softening in his mood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I understand, stranger. I remember my first time in this room, when I felt His presence looming over me. But you cannot so blithely stroke the visage of our dread lord! Such disrespect might summon His wrath, and all of Xochintl would suffer.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“What delightful nonsense!” Zogrusz exclaimed, clapping his hands together. “Did you make it up yourself?”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Zogrusz is an Eldrich Horror, a being from beyond time and space. But&amp;hellip; a nice one? That just wants to do the right thing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book follows Zog and the quasi-Earth (it&amp;rsquo;s never entirely clear) he settles on through thousands of years (mostly with large time jumps) and the rise and fall of various religions up to (and through) and approaching cosmic horror style end of the world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mercy Blade</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/09/mercy-blade/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/09/mercy-blade/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty of chances in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/18/skinwalker/">Skinwalker&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/27/blood-cross/">Blood Cross&lt;/a> to get used to the Vampires, Witches, and &amp;hellip; well Jane and Beast of the world. We&amp;rsquo;ve even barely started to scratch the surface for how Vampires work and how they came to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So of course things have to get &lt;em>complicated&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 9: The Hunter and the Hunted</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/07/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-9-the-hunter-and-the-hunted/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/07/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-9-the-hunter-and-the-hunted/</guid><description>&lt;p>The hand returns…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-9-textbundle-31ffad.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, not that Hand. Logan’s hand. The one with the adamantium claws. I’ve actually enjoyed seeing him with the mismatched claws for a few volumes now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bit of a bummer, other than that. More spinning wheels with nowhere to go for Old Man Logan.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rosewater</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/06/rosewater/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/06/rosewater/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The idea of a singular hero and a manifest destiny just makes us lazy. There is no destiny. There is choice, there is action, and any other narrative perpetuates a myth that someone else out there will fix our problems with a magic sword and a blessing from the gods.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Rosewater has a fascinating premise. Take the world a half century in the future. Most things are the same, but there&amp;rsquo;s a bit more tech floating around, mostly. Introduce a massive alien organism that lands in London and ends up burrowing it&amp;rsquo;s way to Nigeria. From that alien blob, fill the atmosphere with alien microorganisms/cells that create their own xenosphere, enabling (among other things) psychic powers in some very small proportion of the population.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 8: To Kill For</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/05/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-8-to-kill-for/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/05/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-8-to-kill-for/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-8-textbundle-093e2f.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First half: Kingpin has gone all respectable! On the surface. Again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s impressive that keeps working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bullseye is a weird character. Logan’s eye is not healing. And that’s about it&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second half: An Old Geezer and some Z-list X-Men defend the school from… dating site scams?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cute. But also nothing special.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/04/a-wizards-guide-to-defensive-baking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/04/a-wizards-guide-to-defensive-baking/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“It is nearly impossibly to be sad when eating a blueberry muffin. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that&amp;rsquo;s a scientific fact.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I need to read more &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/t.-kingfisher/">T. Kingfisher&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/01/nettle-bone/">Nettle &amp;amp; Bone&lt;/a> was delightful and, if anything, A Wizard&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Defensive Baking is even better!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, we have a world with a specialized sorts of wizards. You might be able to cast lightning bolts&amp;hellip; or you might have the power to animate and converse with dead horses. Or you &lt;em>might&lt;/em> even have magical powers over&amp;hellip; bread!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s such a delightful idea and Kingfisher manages to do all sorts of fun things with it. Some obvious (Mongo eat your gingerbread heart out), some less so (Bob the sourdough starter; so delightful).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 7: Scarlet Samurai</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/31/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-7-scarlet-samurai/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/31/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-7-scarlet-samurai/</guid><description>&lt;p>The hand!

&lt;p>That’s a hot mess of a story—although some of that is probably not really having the background for who a lot of these people are. So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was nice actually (sort of) seeing Logan deal with the slower healing factor. I feel like though most of this we’ve heard of it, but no real problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fun enough read.

&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t often read anthologies, but perhaps I should read more. I do love me some epic fantasy (I&amp;rsquo;ve read the entire &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-wheel-of-time/">The Wheel of Time&lt;/a> half a dozen times now&amp;hellip;), but there&amp;rsquo;s just something about a story that builds up quickly, gets to the point, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t stick around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think of the 8, I only bounced off 1 (which was actually a fine story, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t suspend disbelief enough for the premise) and 1 was a bit meh, just for how short it was. 6 of 8 I absolutely loved though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Absolutely worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VenCo</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/29/venco/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/29/venco/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Hold on a minute,” Lucky said. So far, the stories weren’t making things any clearer. “I don’t get it. Did someone give us the spoons?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Well, yes, in a manner of speaking,” Meena said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“But I found mine. You both found yours.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“In a secret tunnel off your basement?” Lettie replied. “Really? Hanging from a spider web in a graveyard on a specific day?
At the bottom of a box of donated books? Statistically improbable.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Never mind probability, what about the laws of nature? The world cannot be just a series of randoms,” Freya chimed in. “Might as well believe in some beardo in the sky.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a book about spoons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And witches, of course.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“Well, I know there are Wiccans, right? Like a religion?” No one gave her any indication she was on the right path, so she kept talking. “And there are Halloween witches—like vampires and demons and all that. And I know about the bullshit witch trials. Thousands of women burned at the stake for being smart or queer or loud. I guess that’s about it.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>From that day forward she never used my name. Eventually I forgot it. Mrs. H called me something new. She named me cruel and smirking, she named me not for beauty or for cleverness or for sweetness. She named me a thing I could aspire to but never become, the one thing I was not and could never be: Snow White.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It didn’t matter where you were, if you were in a room full of books you were at least halfway home.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/16/the-magicians/">The Magicians&lt;/a>, we had half Harry Potter &lt;em>but cynical&lt;/em> and half Narnia&amp;hellip; &lt;em>but cynical&lt;/em>. In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/20/the-magician-king/">The Magician King&lt;/a>, we mostly stuck around in Fillory (the Narnia analogue). But right at the end&amp;hellip; our well loved (:sarcasm:) main character Quentin pays the ultimate price: he doesn&amp;rsquo;t get to hang out in the magical land anymore and has to go home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Magician&amp;rsquo;s Land picks up from there, with one plot following Quentin as he settles back into a normal life, becomes a teacher, promptly gets fired, and descends to a life of crime. As one does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, we have the (new and improved?) Kings and Queens of Fillory dealingw ith their own sort of armageddon. Turns out saving magic&amp;hellip; wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wednesday</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/25/wednesday/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/25/wednesday/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh that&amp;rsquo;s a delight of a show.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;re creepy and they&amp;rsquo;re kooky&lt;br>
Mysterious and spooky&lt;br>
They&amp;rsquo;re all together ooky&lt;br>
The Addams family&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>An entire show with the dark worldbuilding and humor of the Addams family, focusing around Wednesday (my favorite)? Yes please.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="#casting">casting&lt;/a> is great&amp;ndash;especially Jenna Ortega as the lead and Emma Myers as Enid. A delightful pairing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mystery vibe is on point (and it&amp;rsquo;s right up to the end before you know &lt;em>for sure&lt;/em> who the baddies are).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The setting is fun&amp;ndash;even if the &amp;lsquo;outcasts&amp;rsquo; of Nevermore seem curiously non-magical a lot of the times. And then in the big final numbers, we go full on magic&amp;ndash;which also felt surprisingly weird for the Addams family. ut it works well enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to season 2.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 6: Days of Anger</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/23/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-6-days-of-anger/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/23/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-6-days-of-anger/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hulks!

Back then, I added a &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shortcode&lt;/a> so that I could link to any post by title like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>{{&amp;lt; &lt;span style="color:#f92672">crosslink&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">Title&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">goes&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">here&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>It worked pretty well, but &amp;hellip; it never really felt &amp;lsquo;Markdown&amp;rsquo;y. Which I suppose was the point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But more recently, I came across &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/render-hooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markdown render hooks&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s that you say? I can write code that will take the parameters to any Markdown link (or image/heading/codeblock) and generate the HTML with a custom template?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>That was the thing about the world: it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that things were harder than you thought they were going to be, it was that they were hard in ways that you didn&amp;rsquo;t expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Turns out, if you take &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/16/the-magicians/">The Magicians&lt;/a>, tone down Quentin a bit, and cut the magic school parts to focus mostly on Fillory and adventuring, you get a much better book. It&amp;rsquo;s still a bit much at times and definitely has some &amp;lsquo;middle book syndrome&amp;rsquo; going on, but I quite enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you didn&amp;rsquo;t like the Magicians, you might like this book. If you liked it, particularly the second half, this is probably right up your alley.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 5: Past Lives</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/19/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-5-past-lives/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/19/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-5-past-lives/</guid><description>&lt;p>Memories of the past/future…&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This can’t possibly go well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially when none of his “friends” will help, so he has to turn to darker sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we end up with is Logan bouncing (again) through time, reliving his old adventures for a few pages at a time, unable to change anything that matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s an interesting idea, but once again it doesn’t really have time to breath.

I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for a good new (to me) Urban Fantasy&amp;ndash;and Jane Yellowrock (so far) hits all the right notes. The worldbuilding is neat. The plot is basic enough, but solid. I like the main character(s). And I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing where it goes from here!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the biggest/really only negative with the book is that the writing style starts out fairly rough. It evens out fairly quickly though, so I expect it&amp;rsquo;s more of both the author and the reader finding the voice of the book than anything else.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Underworld: Awakening</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/16/underworld-awakening/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/16/underworld-awakening/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while.

I really like the idea of advancing the world. Bringing the Vampires and the Lycans out into the open. And the humans winning as, with their numbers, makes enough sense in this universe.

&lt;p>I got my heart&amp;rsquo;s desire, and there my troubles began.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well. The majority of comments certainly nailed this one. Two interesting premises in a trenchcoat wrapped in the guise of cynicism and dark humor, underscored by the most depressed to the point of hard to read main character I think I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a long time.&lt;/p>

Another season down and only one more to go (plus some movies?). I&amp;rsquo;m not ready!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This one has a few primarily focuses:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mary and her men&amp;hellip; weird. I kind of liked both of them, but so it goes. Hints at what&amp;rsquo;s to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Isobel and Violet (of all people) getting romantically entangled. That I did not expect, much less with who. It&amp;rsquo;s fun, if sad at times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rose, speedrunning the relationship thing, all with yet another new family for people to disapprove of. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that her dating a black man went so poorly, yet this ends up much better?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course the Bates. Oh the Bates. I truly wish that Season 6 could be quiet and happy for them&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;m not holding up too much hope for that one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, yet another solid season. Like I said, I&amp;rsquo;m not ready for the end! But all good things must.

&lt;p>For better or for worse, The Goblin Emperor has surprisingly low stakes. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a book about the new emperor standing against invasion.

If you didn&amp;rsquo;t care for them, there&amp;rsquo;s a chance!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Orville: New Horizons (Season 3)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/05/the-orville-new-horizons-season-3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/05/the-orville-new-horizons-season-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>3 year time jump!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, there&amp;rsquo;s so much going on in this season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both large (Kaylon! Moclan! Krill! new friends and foes alike!) and small (so many relationships! new crew and old!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see how much this show has grown and changed. I just about bounced off the first few episodes, back when it was leaning hard into the humor and less into the sci-fi. But now&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see both the funny and the serious takes on all sorts of issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A delightful third season. If/when we get a Season 4, I&amp;rsquo;ll most certainly have to check it out.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
