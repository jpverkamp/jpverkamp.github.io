&lt;p>Murderbot has really stirred up some trouble. Now Dr. Mesnah&amp;rsquo;s caught up in it and it&amp;rsquo;s time to come back and perhaps fix some things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like the rest, it&amp;rsquo;s a quick read with a wonderful sense of all too familiar alienness, wonderful hacking and action scenes, and a fascinating look at what it means to be a person&amp;ndash;or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth the read, but at this point, I expect you&amp;rsquo;ll already be blowing through these.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Redwall: The Graphic Novel</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/09/redwall-the-graphic-novel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/09/redwall-the-graphic-novel/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s a great story. I read it long ago and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/06/19/redwall/">listened to it a couple years ago&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s a great story of animals basically doing the human thing in and around an abbey run by mice. It&amp;rsquo;s great fun so long as you don&amp;rsquo;t think too long and hard about which animals are sentient and which aren&amp;rsquo;t and how the vast differences in scale and lack of opposable thumbs could possibly work&amp;hellip; but other than that, it&amp;rsquo;s great fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Formatwise, I&amp;rsquo;ve read a few graphic novel adaptations of novels and usually they feel a little lackluster (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/02/16/white-sand-volume-1/">White Sands&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/08/storm-front/">Storm Front&lt;/a> as two examples), but if anything was going to work, this was it. It&amp;rsquo;s already a lighter fantasy world with lots of light riddles and actions and over the top characters that fit just fine with graphic novels. And it pays off. As an introduction to this world, it&amp;rsquo;s a great alternative. It&amp;rsquo;s just so fun to see pictures of how someone else saw all of the characters from this world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well worth the read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>V for Vendetta</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/09/v-for-vendetta/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/09/v-for-vendetta/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>That’s quite a story; quite a world. I only vaguely remember the film, but I still hear Hugo Weaving’s voice as V and Natalie Portman as Evey. The bones of what I remember match though. A story of a world gone well over the edge and a man determined to bring it back—but at what cost?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fascinating read and worth the time. I need to watch the movie now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pocahontas</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/07/pocahontas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/07/pocahontas/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/movies/pocahontas.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>One of my favorites of the Disney animated classics. It&amp;rsquo;s a straight forward enough story that at least takes some pains to show the terrible way that European settlers treated Native Americans and shows that people are people and will often try to do the right thing, given a chance. The music is wonderful and the animation is really quite something that up even today.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moon Knight</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/moon-knight/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/moon-knight/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/moon-knight.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>That &amp;hellip; was truly bizarre. A main character with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dissociative%20identity%20disorder">dissociative identity disorder&lt;/a> where their powers deal with but &lt;em>are not&lt;/em> caused by their disorder is fascinating (and truly weird to be watching at the same time as &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/01/altered-carbon-season-1/">Altered Carbon&lt;/a>&amp;hellip;), the Egyptian background and characters are great, and there&amp;rsquo;s are some pretty awesome scenes, fight and otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Castingwise, Oscar Isaac is awesome. I&amp;rsquo;m amazed at how he brings both Marc and Steven to life. Ethan Hawke is a great maybe-baddie-but-maybe-just-a-different-point-of-view. And May Calamawy as Layla El-Faouly is a real stand out in just about everyway. I hope that we get to see more of them in the greater MCU, although I have no idea how that&amp;rsquo;s going to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of which, this was so different from other MCU properties. It&amp;rsquo;s got Egyptian gods and powers more or less walking around, which fits, but I do really wander how/if we&amp;rsquo;d see them or their avatars square off against normal MCU level heroes. Tonally, it&amp;rsquo;s rather different too. There&amp;rsquo;s still an end of the world threat, but a lot of it&amp;rsquo;s dealing with the internal struggles of Steven/Marc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s probably my favorite of the MCU TV shows so far&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll have to rewatch it and see if it holds up. It&amp;rsquo;s really quite good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl/</guid><description> Ranked: 2022 Movie Reviews EncantoSpider-Man: No Way HomeStar Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of SkywalkerPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black PearlPocahontasStar Wars: Episode VII - The Force AwakensStar Wars: Episode VIII - The Last JediToy StoryHarry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to HogwartsThe GrinchThe Star</description></item><item><title>Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/stiff-the-curious-lives-of-human-cadavers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/stiff-the-curious-lives-of-human-cadavers/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>Death. It doesn’t have to be boring.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s quite a book. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to try out one of Mary Roach&amp;rsquo;s books for a while and this one came up on the (digital) library, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a try. In a nutshell, it goes into the process of what happens right up to and after you die (including brain death and organ donation) along with the various things that might be done with your body afterwards (such as medical training and testing various products along with alternatives to burial).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“What I do is, I think of them as wax.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Theresa is practicing a time-honored coping method: objectification. For those who must deal with human corpses regularly, it is easier (and, I suppose, more accurate) to think of them as objects, not people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating look into things you just don&amp;rsquo;t often think of. I quite enjoyed it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Altered Carbon: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/01/altered-carbon-season-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/01/altered-carbon-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/altered-carbon.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>That is a spectacular show. In a nutshell, it takes a cyberpunk future world where the technology exists to separate the &amp;lsquo;mind&amp;rsquo;/stack/DHF of a person from their body/sleeve. Really, it&amp;rsquo;s primarily a tool for the wealthy to accumulate even more wealth and a number of the characters mention that we aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to live forever&amp;hellip; And that actually made me think. It&amp;rsquo;s been something I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought would be neat: to be able to repair or move into another body if this is damaged, to send me mind to other worlds, etc. But how in the world would people react to that sort of power and change?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the very least, let&amp;rsquo;s hope it&amp;rsquo;s better than what we see in Altered Carbon. Hoo boy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s part detective show that segues into murder/revenge/revolution plots with more than a dash of questions around identity in a world where bodies are quite literally and easily (if not cheaply) replaceable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of rather graphic violence and nudity, but for the most part it makes sense within the context of the show. Certainly not one for the kids though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The casting, I loved. Joel Kinnaman as Takeshi Kovacs nails the &amp;lsquo;Envoy brought back&amp;rsquo;, Dichen Lachman as Reileen Kawahara is a wonderful &lt;span class="spoiler">example of long lives corrupting people&lt;/span>
. My surprise favorite? Chris Conner as &amp;lsquo;Poe&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;the AI running an Edgar Allen Poe themed hotel that hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen a guest in years/decades. He&amp;rsquo;s such a surprisingly wonderful character.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s quite a spectacular show. Well worth the watch. Now the confusing it&amp;hellip; &lt;span class="spoiler">apparently almost the entire cast was replaced for S2?&lt;/span>
It&amp;rsquo;s something that the concept of the show certainly allows, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know how in the world they&amp;rsquo;re going to pull that one off. I guess we&amp;rsquo;ll see!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eric Carle's Animals Animals</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/29/eric-carles-animals-animals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/29/eric-carles-animals-animals/</guid><description>That&amp;rsquo;s an adorable and longer than expected book of poetry about animals in various ways and forms in prime Eric Carle form.

&lt;p>“Amias Mitchell,’ Kip said. ‘Born aboard the Asteria. Forty Solar days of age as of GC standard day 211/310. He is now, and always, a member of our Fleet. By our laws, he is assured shelter and passage here. If we have food, he will eat. If we have air, he will breathe. If we have fuel, he will fly. He is son to all grown, brother to all still growing. We will care for him, protect him, guide him. We welcome you, Amias, to the decks of the Asteria, and to the journey we take together.’ He spoke the final words now, and the room joined him. ‘From the ground, we stand. From our ships, we live. By the stars, we hope.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s absolutely fascinating what Becky Chambers has done with The Wayfarers books. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/31/the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet/">In one&lt;/a>, we get a slice of life on a long haul spaceship with all sorts of aliens; [in two]({{ref &amp;ldquo;2022-04-10-a-closed-and-common-orbit&amp;rdquo;}}), we get an embodied AI and a former cloned slave learning about being people, and now&amp;hellip; we get the most &amp;lsquo;human&amp;rsquo; centric of the stories thus far. It&amp;rsquo;s all about the Exodus Fleet&amp;ndash;a few dozen generation ships built from the ruins of Earth&amp;rsquo;s cities and launched into deep space what feels like a very long time ago&amp;ndash;certainly before humanity knew for sure there was anyone else out there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Edgeworld: A Little Chaos In Your Life</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/19/edgeworld-a-little-chaos-in-your-life/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/19/edgeworld-a-little-chaos-in-your-life/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/09/23/locke-key-vol.-1-welcome-to-lovecraft/">Locke &amp;amp; Key graphic novels&lt;/a>, so of course I had to give the TV show a try. Turns out: also really good. While they changed a few things with the details of how the keys worked that are probably more efficient to do in TV (not opening the tops of people&amp;rsquo;s heads for instance), it&amp;rsquo;s still got the same wonderfully creepy dark magical vibe. I do love the actors&amp;ndash;Bode in particular does his part very well, as do his siblings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man that&amp;rsquo;s a crazy show. Well worth the show (warning, it is dark, although not overly graphic). On to season 2!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Complete Maus</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/19/the-complete-maus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/19/the-complete-maus/</guid><description>Maus. What&amp;rsquo;s there even to say? It&amp;rsquo;s a story about a son and a father. About growing up Jewish during the rise of the Nazi party and during the Holocaust. About the ways that dramatically changes the lives of even those survive.
All told in a comic book style with different style animals for different races.
It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating way to tell the story (a (Jewish) mouse wearing a (Polish) pig mask to hide from the Nazis&amp;hellip;) even if / perhaps because it raises questions of it&amp;rsquo;s own.</description></item><item><title>Rogue Protocol</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/17/rogue-protocol/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 00:00:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/17/rogue-protocol/</guid><description>(There needs to be an error code that means “I received your request but decided to ignore you.”)
I do love me some Murderbot.
First, we got the origin story and then the one where the mystery deepens.

&lt;p>Suicide Bridge: a single, not bad. Curse of the Constantines: it’s about blood and family and the nephew never mentioned. I like the idea of sometimes blood matters—and sometimes it doesn’t. Death and Cigarettes—a send off, Constantine style. He never really dies. Seems weird to have Epiphany and Finn here. Bad Blood… what was that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, out in Constantine style, could have done without Bad Blood. So it goes.

&lt;p>Man Constantine’s life is a mess. Father in law has some use for him—which goes badly. He’s down a thumb and needs to deal with that—which goes badly. His coat’s gone evil walkabout—which goes badly. Gemma has it out for him (or at least his demonic twin)—which goes badly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>El is a super dramatic senior&amp;ndash;and she&amp;rsquo;s got her reasons, with the whole potential Dark Goddess thing she has going on&amp;ndash;and life is only getting weirder. She&amp;rsquo;s determined to get &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em> out, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the least bit of sense and she&amp;rsquo;s absolutely going to do it in world ending style. Oh, and of course there&amp;rsquo;s Orion. What&amp;rsquo;s up with that relationship, am I right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, if you loved &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/13/a-deadly-education/">A Deadly Education&lt;/a> (as I did), you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to love The Last Graduate. It turns the whole Scholomance craziness up to 11, gives us a dark chosen one that actually kind of works within the world building, and I really do love and care for the characters. And if the cliff hanger at the end of book 1 wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough&amp;hellip; THERE&amp;rsquo;S AN EVEN WORSE ONE AND THE NEXT BOOK ISN&amp;rsquo;T EVEN OUT YET.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When constructs were first developed, they were originally supposed to have a pre-sentient level of intelligence, like the dumber variety of bot. But you can’t put something as dumb as a hauler bot in charge of security for anything without spending even more money for expensive company-employed human supervisors. So they made us smarter. The anxiety and depression were side effects.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is an exercise in fictional science, or science fiction, if you like that better. Not for amusement: science fiction in the service of science. Or just science, if you agree that fiction is part of it, always was, and always will be as long as our brains are only minuscule fragments of the universe, much too small to hold all the facts of the world but not too idle to speculate about them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What am I in for…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it’s an interesting read. In a nutshell, it builds up a model for ‘vehicles’ that start with a single wheel and basic sensor and grows, adding better senses and in particular a more and more complicated brain. I would have liked something a bit more technical and/or practical but there are a lot of interesting ideas here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One downside, the wording is … a bit pretentious at times. Academic is probably a better word. Above is the first paragraph.. and that’s really how it stays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, an interesting enough and surprisingly quick read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Deadly Education</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/13/a-deadly-education/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/13/a-deadly-education/</guid><description>Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s a joy of a book. Saying which I suppose&amp;ndash;after you&amp;rsquo;ve read it&amp;ndash;feels a bit ironic.
It&amp;rsquo;s one part magic school, with your more or less typical teenage protagonists doing more or less typical teenage thing. In my opinion, Novik does this very well. Main character El (short for Galadriel) is so wonderfully snarky and done with it teenage girl that I could practically feel her angst coming off the page&amp;ndash;and it&amp;rsquo;s all the better, because she really does have a good reason for it.</description></item><item><title>Paradise Lost</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/12/paradise-lost/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/12/paradise-lost/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s an odd sort of book. It&amp;rsquo;s basically the story of the Fall of Satan plus Genesis, wrapped up in some crazy flowery poetry, writ long. It&amp;rsquo;s been on my &amp;lsquo;why not&amp;rsquo; list for a long time and hearing more about it in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/07/daemon-voices/">Daemon Voices&lt;/a> bumped it up a fair bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Am I glad to have read it? Yes. Is it a good book? Maybe. The poetry is absolutely beautiful in some places, but the story is one you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard before, if you&amp;rsquo;ve any sort of judeo-christian upbringing, although it does embelish in spots. And oy does it get long. It thought there were 7 books for some reason, so when I finished number 7 and we&amp;rsquo;re barely into Genesis&amp;hellip;, well, I knew I was wrong about that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, the first few books with the fall of Satan are very cool and I&amp;rsquo;d say worth reading.

&lt;p>Life is terrifying. None of us have a rule book. None of us know what we&amp;rsquo;re doing here. So, the easiest way to stare reality in the face and not utterly lose your shit is to believe that you have control over it. If you believe you have control, then you believe you&amp;rsquo;re at the top. And if you&amp;rsquo;re at the top, then people who aren&amp;rsquo;t like you&amp;hellip; well, they&amp;rsquo;ve got to be somewhere lower, right? Every species does this. Does it again and again and again. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if they do it to themselves, or another species, or someone they created.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Turns out&amp;hellip; just like this. This is a very very good sequel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, A Closed and Common Orbit was a bit of a surprise. We only barely get any of the characters we know and love from the first book. There are a few hints of and references to them, but for the most part, we instead focus on Lovey/Sidra* and Pepper, learning once again how two very strange and different sorts of people can grow into a family.

&lt;p>Okay, I get what all the hype is about. Take a heavily armed cyborg/clone, designed entirely as muscle to defend the more squishy &amp;lsquo;traditional&amp;rsquo; humans, have it turn off the software constraining it from killing everyone, add in a wonderfully snarky sense of humor&amp;hellip; and see what happens.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I COULD HAVE BECOME a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Since before I could remember, Mamá had taught me the legends of the criaturas. They were creatures unlike humans, children of the Desert goddess, who the Great Namer created from dust and words. Mama taught me the difference between animal criaturas, who were made to fill the desert, and dark criaturas, who were made to attack the descendants of the Sun god—us. But her advice for dealing with both types was the same.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a delightful book.

It&amp;rsquo;s got a touch of southwest US / Mexican mythology with Coyote myths, El Sombrerón//La Chupacabra/La Llorona and others, brujas, and touch of Pokemon/creature collection with whole loads of hearts and the power of one little girl trying to save her sister and instead&amp;ndash;perhaps&amp;ndash;accidentally changing the world along the way.

&lt;p>On one level, it&amp;rsquo;s about fatherhood. Apollo grew up without a dad and vows he&amp;rsquo;s going to do better by his own son. And right from the beginning&amp;ndash;a surprise delivery no one around was quite ready for&amp;ndash;he does everything he can. As a father, with my youngest about the age of Apollo&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; when things go sideways. But we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On another level, it&amp;rsquo;s about motherhood. Emma had all sorts of issues of her own, but she and Apollo seem absolutely delightful together. So when the first signs of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/postpartum%20depression">postpartum depression&lt;/a> start, it&amp;rsquo;s terrifying and entirely too relatable to many parents out there. New babies are hard, not going to lie, and everyone deals with that completely differently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a third, it&amp;rsquo;s about fairy tales and other stories. The stories we read to our children and the stories we tell ourselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And on a last level, it&amp;rsquo;s about magic. There are hints right from the beginning that there&amp;rsquo;s something strange in this world. From Apollo&amp;rsquo;s dreams of his absent father, to the magic inheriant in old books and libraries, to finding a postcard from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister%20Crowley">Aleister Crowley&lt;/a>&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s little in the way of obviously supernatural for most of the book&amp;hellip; but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t last.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 20: Systems of Control</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/25/hellblazer-vol.-20-systems-of-control/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/25/hellblazer-vol.-20-systems-of-control/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Physics of the Impossible is a really great book. It goes into a wide variety of primarily science fictional topics in decreasingly order of likelihood and gets into how each works (so far as they do work with what we know now) and what it would take to make them possible. There&amp;rsquo;s just enough scientific background that I understood most of it and could stretch for the rest, with pointers for what to search for to learn more, which is always a good way to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read! One interesting point is how many of these seeded ideas for more stories in the future! Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Runelang: The Parser (Part 2: Expressions)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/18/runelang-the-parser-part-2-expressions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/18/runelang-the-parser-part-2-expressions/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/15/runelang-the-parser-part-1/">Earlier this week&lt;/a>, we started parsing, getting through groups, nodes, params, and lists. A pretty good start, but it also leaves out two very powerful things (expressions and defines), one of which we absolutely do need to start actually evaluating things: expressions. Since we use them in every param, we pretty much need to know how to parse them, so let&amp;rsquo;s do it!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Man: No Way Home</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/18/spider-man-no-way-home/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/18/spider-man-no-way-home/</guid><description>Finally got around to watching this. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did, it&amp;rsquo;s hilarious and an aboslute blast of nostalgia. Similar to Avengers: Endgame, I don&amp;rsquo;t know know if this would possibly hold up without the weight of all of the movies that came before it (I doubt it), but with that weight&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s really really good.
It&amp;rsquo;s funny, it&amp;rsquo;s touching, and there are some really crazy action scenes. But the greatest strength of course comes from bringing back a half dozen villains and all three modern live action Spider-Men into one film .</description></item><item><title>Schitt's Creek: Season 6</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/17/schitts-creek-season-6/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/17/schitts-creek-season-6/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/schitts-creek-season-6.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>And so it ends. As expected, David and Patrick&amp;rsquo;s wedding is a big storyline (and man David is neurotic when stressed), but we also have Alexis continuing to grow in relationships and work (which is such an amazing growth from Season 1), the whole hotel starting to grow (rapidly) and Moira doing Moira things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a good way to end the show. We have some ending up moving back to the lives they once had, hopefully a little more self aware (I doubt so in Moira&amp;rsquo;s case&amp;hellip;) from their time in Schitt&amp;rsquo;s Creek.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not a show I normally would have chosen, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have watched it. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 18: The Gift</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/15/hellblazer-vol.-18-the-gift/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/15/hellblazer-vol.-18-the-gift/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

Nate the Great!
They vary a bit in quality, but &amp;lsquo;Stalks Stupidweed&amp;rsquo; is pretty high up there in my opinion. It&amp;rsquo;s cute and has a few laugh out loud moments. Worth a try (especially if you&amp;rsquo;ve read the first 8).</description></item><item><title>Runelang: The Parser (Part 1)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/15/runelang-the-parser-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/15/runelang-the-parser-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m still here! And less sick now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last time(s), we &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/23/runelang-language-specification/">described&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/24/runelang-the-lexer/">lexed&lt;/a> Runelang! This time around, let&amp;rsquo;s take the lexed tokens and go one step further and parse them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, how do we go about this? With a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recursive%20descent%20parser">recursive descent parser&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Start with a list/stream of tokens&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using the first &lt;em>k&lt;/em> (in a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL%28k%29%20parser">LL(k) parser&lt;/a>) elements of the list, identify which sort of object we are parsing (a &lt;code>group&lt;/code> / &lt;code>identifier&lt;/code> / &lt;code>literal&lt;/code> / &lt;code>expression&lt;/code> / etc)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Call a parsing function for that object type (&lt;code>parseGroup&lt;/code> etc) that will:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Recursively parse the given object type (this may in turn call more parse functions)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advance the token stream &amp;lsquo;consuming&amp;rsquo; any tokens used in this group so the new &amp;lsquo;first&amp;rsquo; element is the next object&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>He is interested in the discoveries of science (“intellectual daring and imaginative brilliance without parallel”), the freedoms of democracy (in particular “the great democracy of reading and writing”), the evils of authoritarianism (“always reductive whether it’s in power or not”) and the pitfalls of education (“any education that neglects the experience of delight will be a dry and tasteless diet with no nourishment in it”). He is profoundly interested in religion, while remaining puzzled by aspects of it. “The first thing to say about the Bishop’s arguments in his book,” he writes in “God and Dust,” “is that I agree with every word of them, except the words I don’t understand; and that the words I don’t understand are those such as spirit, spiritual and God.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Philip Pullman is an interesting author, which makes Daemon Voices an interesting sort of book. In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s a selected collection of essays and presentation he&amp;rsquo;s given over the years on a wide range of topics. In particular, he talks a lot about Paradise Lost (makes me want to actually read it), his religious and philosophical views (and a dive into Gnosticism) and how those interact with his writing, and a bit on writing advice and his own particular style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating look and there&amp;rsquo;s a little for everyone, so if you like what Pullman has written, you can certainly do worse than give it a chance!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are a few interesting quotes that I highlighted for just about every essay. It&amp;rsquo;s not really the sort of book where one should worry about spoilers, but just in case that&amp;rsquo;s not a shared option, you have been warned.
