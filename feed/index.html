&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a bonkers plot (aren&amp;rsquo;t they all?), based around the idea of &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola%20Tesla">Nikola Tesla&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s doomsday weapons were REAL&amp;rsquo; (albeit assigned to a made up Hungarian scientist instead), evil anarchists inadvertently teaming up with the very elite they&amp;rsquo;re trying to overthrow, and&amp;hellip; for some reason throwing mysterious cities and living fossils in for good measure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The science is&amp;hellip; messy at best. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of electromagnetism which they handwave as not directly causing a lot of the issues we see, but rather setting things that could otherwise have happened in motion, but&amp;hellip; the sense of scale never quite works. The code work involved in the secret solution to it all is&amp;hellip; just not good (it&amp;rsquo;s barely a code and there&amp;rsquo;s no way to tell they interpreted it correctly at that). The mammoth parts and new entire-field-of-archeology-upsetting discoveries are&amp;hellip; convenient and yet barely make an impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, &amp;lsquo;Uncle Karl&amp;rsquo; here is such a delight. An old soldier trying to do the right thing one last time. He&amp;rsquo;s a fun contrast to the young action heroes in most of these books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The action is, for the most part, fine. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing nearly as spectacular as the castle/island escape scenes from the last book, but there&amp;rsquo;s a nice sense of tension through this book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yet, it&amp;rsquo;s still a surprisingly good book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Underground</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/02/the-underground/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/02/the-underground/</guid><description>&lt;p>A secret weapon against the Yeerks?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Cassie suddenly laughed. It was a cynical laugh. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know she was capable of a cynical laugh. &amp;ldquo;And all the rights and wrongs, and all the lines between good and evil, just go wafting and waving and swirling around, don&amp;rsquo;t they?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Yeah. Of course things couldn&amp;rsquo;t be that easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s another in the series continuing to dig into just how terrible some of the things these kids (and don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong&amp;ndash;they are &lt;em>so&lt;/em> young for &lt;em>any&lt;/em> of this) find themselves doing. For the most part, they&amp;rsquo;ve survived unscathed. And they have a certain amount of plot immunity. But even that, you can&amp;rsquo;t expect to hold out forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s an intense book, somewhat offset (and at times I would even say weakened) by the constant ridiculousness of said &amp;lsquo;secret weapon&amp;rsquo;. One strange bit, so far as I remember&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s never mentioned again. Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m just not remembering it, it has been a while, but it seems a weird thing to drop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But worth the (re-)read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Warning</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/31/the-warning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/31/the-warning/</guid><description>&lt;p>The one with the (mid-90s) Internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much of the technology in this book is weird and dated&amp;ndash;primarily since it comes on the tale end of the AOL-style internet, with chat rooms and email clients baked into your connection itself and before the more free-for-all (glorious) mess of the early 2000s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, bragging about 38400 baud modems. Talking about &amp;lsquo;code words&amp;rsquo; instead of passwords. Associating cookies with your &amp;lsquo;screen name&amp;rsquo;. A search result (even for a weird &amp;lsquo;made up&amp;rsquo; term) returning exactly &lt;em>one&lt;/em> hit. It&amp;rsquo;s such a weird mix of now dated technology of the time&amp;ndash;some done slightly wrong. And it&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also the one (of many) where they start to touch on the moral complexities of (teenagers fighting a) war.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It was the best you could do,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;It was all you could do. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s hard to fight evil without doing some along the way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We saw a bit of this in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/28/the-escape/">The Escape&lt;/a>, but it&amp;rsquo;s really coming home now:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I just want to get back to a life someday where I don&amp;rsquo;t have to make decisions that might get people killed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Do you?&amp;rdquo; Now Marco&amp;rsquo;s smile was definitely of the mocking variety. &amp;ldquo;You really think someday we can all go back to being regular kids? You think after being the leader of the Animorphs you can go back to being Joe Average Student?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, I do.&amp;rdquo; I said it forcefully. I meant it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And&amp;hellip; yeah.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s hard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it&amp;rsquo;s not going to get any easier over the remaining dozens of books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oy for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cave of Bones: A True Story of Discovery, Adventure, and Human Origins</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/29/cave-of-bones-a-true-story-of-discovery-adventure-and-human-origins/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/29/cave-of-bones-a-true-story-of-discovery-adventure-and-human-origins/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently listened to the &lt;a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-stuff-to-blow-your-mind-21123915/episode/cave-of-bones-with-lee-berger-120180187/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;lsquo;Cave of Bones&amp;rsquo; episode of Stuff to Blow Your Mind&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;a chat with paleoanthropologist Lee Berger all about his discoveries in a cave system in South Africa&amp;ndash;and what it might mean to the history of human kind.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>And oh, how crazy things get. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad to see the Truebloods again. Pregnant Molly is fun. Angie Baby is scary and adorable. Evan is going to get himself revealed. And now we can good witch / evil witch with the best of them!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Escape</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/28/the-escape/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/28/the-escape/</guid><description>&lt;p>Marco books have some of the best snippets.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I jumped in, feet first, around the eight-foot marker. I bobbed back up to the surface and said, &amp;ldquo;This is insane, Marco.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To which I answered, &amp;ldquo;So I&amp;rsquo;ll be careful.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To which I countered, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re talking to yourself, do you know that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, shut up,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You know, sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s just a very fine line between us and the Three Stooges,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;What are stooges?&amp;gt; Ax asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A stooge is a guy stupid enough to run around inside a Yeerk stronghold wearing a pair of bike shorts and accompanied by a Deer-man from outer space and a mouse-eating Bird-boy. That&amp;rsquo;s a stooge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Also, SHARKS!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;re the Hork-Bajir of the sea! Apparently literally. It&amp;rsquo;s an odd one to pair right fater &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/25/the-unknown/">The Unknown&lt;/a>. Back to back books talking about non-human/animal Controllers, although with rather different outcomes. And now I want to look up the differences between shark and horse brains&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus, we get an appearance by a new, interesting race (mind reading amphibians!), more Visser One scenes (of course, it&amp;rsquo;s a Marco points of view)/Visser Three politics, and some underwater adventures, which are neat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a decent entry. Up from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/24/the-change/">The Change&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/25/the-unknown/">The Unknown&lt;/a>, I think.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Basically, the entire idea is that you don&amp;rsquo;t need quite so much (explicit) JavaScript everywhere. It should be possible to declaratively design pages that can automatically take actions (including HTTP verbs other than &lt;code>GET&lt;/code> and &lt;code>POST&lt;/code>) and replace (partial) content on pages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s why I read the book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Rhai Book</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/26/the-rhai-book/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/26/the-rhai-book/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://rhai.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhai&lt;/a> is a scripting language written in and generally used by the programming language Rust when you want something a bit more dynamic/don&amp;rsquo;t want to recomile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Rhai book is the &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mdBook&lt;/a> style documentation that describes the language, gets into how to use it (in both straight forward and more complicated scenarios), and acts as a reference when needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an odd one to read straight through, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for exactly this sort of thing (an embeddable scripting language for Rust) so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give it a chance!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Change</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/24/the-change/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/24/the-change/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“And what do you want, Tobias?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>”You know what I want,” I said, almost choking on the words. ”You know.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>”Yes. But do YOU know what you want, Tobias?”, the Ellimist asked. ”And if you get it, will you still know?”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Yes. Spoilers. The Ellimist is around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And since this originally released the same day as &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/23/the-andalite-chronicles/">The Andalite Chronicles&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;and because it&amp;rsquo;s a Tobias book, you had to expect it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short, the Ellimist is (totally not 😉) interfering to free some Hork-Bajir. Tobias gets roped in. We do learn a lot more about Hork-Bajir (more than we will really until somewhat later in The Hork-Bajir Chronicles). It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing to be doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yet, I still totally get Tobias lamenting getting jerked around like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But in the end&amp;ndash;it was all worth it?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Andalite Chronicles</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/23/the-andalite-chronicles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/23/the-andalite-chronicles/</guid><description>&lt;p>Something new! (If you not on a reread :))&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rather than the shared points of view of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/12/the-andalites-gift/">The Andalite&amp;#39;s Gift&lt;/a>, we now have the first [[Animorphs Chronicles|chronicle]] book: a book written from a completely alien (heh) point of view to fill in some other part of the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this case Elfangor-Sirinial-Shamtul. The one who in a lot of ways started this whole mess. And after reading this book&amp;ndash;apparently in more ways than we could believe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the plus side, we get a lot of fascinating world building. Learning more about Andelite culture directly, as opposed to via our normal human filters. Learning about Yeerks. Visser Three (before he was Three!). And Taxxons. And Skrit Na.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Skrit Na ship was round, with tapered sides. It looked like a fat disc. You could hardly even see where the engines were, and the Skrit Na had blinking colored lights all around it. I guess they find that attractive or something.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>(it&amp;rsquo;s a typical saucer shaped UFO)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand (minor spoilers, but it becomes obvious fairly early), time travel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve done that already&amp;ndash;and not that long ago (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/21/the-forgotten/">The Forgotten&lt;/a>). And&amp;hellip; while it&amp;rsquo;s got some interesting points here, it makes things a bit too messy and convenient, at least in my opinion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Reaction</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/22/the-reaction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/22/the-reaction/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of amazing how many different one off plot lines this series introduces and just never (so far as I remember) deals with again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around&amp;hellip; being (somehow) allergic to newly acquired DNA!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat idea and does enough to support the story by itself&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So of course we have to deal with some random made up teenage heartthrob storyline.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I ignored Marco. I almost always do. Instead I made sure Jake was paying attention, and I said, &amp;ldquo;Jake, you&amp;rsquo;re not getting it. About half the girls in our school have a poster of Jeremy Jason McCole in their bedrooms or in their lockers, or both. He is the number one cute guy in the country. He has like twenty Web sites just about him. If he endorses The Sharing, it would be as if . . .&amp;rdquo; I looked to Cassie for help.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; weird. I get it. They&amp;rsquo;re teenagers. But it&amp;rsquo;s still not something I really understood even then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such is life.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The one with a big ball of wibbly wobbly&amp;hellip; time-y wimey&amp;hellip; stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s weird tension (did he finally go crazy?) and a neat resolution (possibly, but at least this time around he&amp;rsquo;s not) that theoretically raises some big interesting world building problems&amp;ndash;that we probably won&amp;rsquo;t ever have to deal with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a good one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dark Heir</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/20/dark-heir/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/20/dark-heir/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My eyes latched onto his black ones, his desiccated lips moving. Shock thrummed through me like the single tone of a large bell, recently struck, vibrating, a pounding pulse of surprise. As the vibrations hit me, I realized that the pulse wasn’t just shock, but was part of the word I’d been hearing. Joses Bar-Judas was speaking that word. That wyrd. A spell of darkness encoded into a single word, the power released when it was spoken.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so we&amp;rsquo;re introduced to a &lt;em>really&lt;/em> old big bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting in books like these when you have relatively &amp;rsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; points of view mixed in with characters that are literally centuries/millennia old.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Black Mirror: Season 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/18/black-mirror-season-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/18/black-mirror-season-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Onward we go!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only barely long than season 2, it still manages to pack quite a bunch. We have the &lt;a href="#1-be-right-back">prescient one (given all the news about LLMs/AIs)&lt;/a>, the &lt;a href="#2-white-bear">one where the world&amp;rsquo;s ended&lt;/a> (or may be a world has ended), the &lt;a href="#3-the-waldo-moment">politics are stupid&amp;ndash;ha ha&amp;ndash;one&lt;/a>, and the &lt;a href="#4-white-christmas">twisted and all connected one&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is quite the show. How did I miss this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to season 2!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Android</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/18/the-android/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/18/the-android/</guid><description>&lt;p>The one where Marco gets a haircut.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we discover yet another random alien species that&amp;rsquo;s been living among us all along.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting book, digging (if less than it could) into ideas like radical pacifism, free will, and the domestication of modern dogs. All with the trademark Marco snark as the point of view.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;English paper?&amp;rdquo; Jake asked as he sat down across from me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yeah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He laughed. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re good for me, Marco. Compared to you, I&amp;rsquo;m so responsible. You have a topic?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I looked up at him and thumped my finger down on the paper. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve already written three pages. What do you mean, do I have a topic?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But Jake knows me. &amp;ldquo;So,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Do you have a topic?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A topic will . . . emerge. I&amp;rsquo;m going to just write until I discover a topic. The topic will rise from these pages. It will reveal itself to me. I just have to keep writing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He nodded and made a face at the Goo of the Day on his tray. &amp;ldquo;This food is blue. Food should not be blue. Hey, here&amp;rsquo;s a topic for you - the use of total bull in the writing of English papers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I grinned. &amp;ldquo;I am the master of bull. Three pages so far and I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually said a single thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t particular remember if/when we see the Chee (spoilers!) again, but if we do, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot left on the floor here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of my favorites so far.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Secret</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/17/the-secret/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/17/the-secret/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s amusing just how much trouble the Animorphs (six kids, remember) cause the Yeerks on Earth (and Visser Three in particular).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much so that they&amp;rsquo;re willing to come up with convoluted schemes to get approval to log an entire forest where they suspect those &amp;lsquo;Andelite bandits&amp;rsquo; are hiding. (Which, to be fair, they&amp;rsquo;re not entirely wrong about).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So of course, Cassie gets the point of view and we have to SAVE THE SKUNKS! (it makes more sense than you might think).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A solid entry.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Dragons of Blueland</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/the-dragons-of-blueland/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/the-dragons-of-blueland/</guid><description>&lt;p>Elmer is finally home! And now Boris can go home as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only to immediately run into trouble (his family has been trapped!) and fly all the way back to pick up the one friend he has (Elmer. Duh. 😄) and get the help he needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a weird premise, but a fun enough book. The mathematical problem solving (and oh so prescient packing) comes to a head here, but it&amp;rsquo;s just as fun as ever to read in the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s the weakest of the bunch, but a decent end to the series.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Elmer and the Dragon</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/elmer-and-the-dragon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/elmer-and-the-dragon/</guid><description>&lt;p>The somewhat sillier (who&amp;rsquo;d have thought it possible) sequel to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/my-fathers-dragon/">My Father&amp;#39;s Dragon&lt;/a>, wherein Elmer and Boris take an entire book to return home (and all sorts of strange things happen along the way).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s really the second half of the book (and if you read it as part of &lt;em>Three Tales of My Father&amp;rsquo;s Dragon&lt;/em> it fits better)&amp;ndash;and slightly weaker, especially without the first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing to love about both the first and this book is the weird obsession with &amp;lsquo;inventory tracking&amp;rsquo;. He picks 38 tangerines. Then eats 15. Then 11 more. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun way for kids who&amp;rsquo;s minds work that way to track things, do math, all the while looking for that &lt;em>mistake&lt;/em> they know must be there!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also a nice touch that we stick around with the new characters we meet a lot better this time. The entire book is about Elmer, Boris, and the canaries, rather than a new animal puzzle each chapter. I like it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>For All Mankind</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/for-all-mankind/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/for-all-mankind/</guid><description>&lt;p>Watched with someone that didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the show was about. A few minutes of &amp;ldquo;okay, so it&amp;rsquo;s about the moon landing.&amp;rdquo; And then the moment when he speaks&amp;hellip; Delightful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about &lt;strong>STOP READING NOW AND GO WATCH THIS SHOW&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m waiting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea of an alternate history where the Soviets made it to the moon is so fascinating. And it&amp;rsquo;s only made all the better by all the character moments and (surprisingly to me) other historical events &lt;em>not on the moon&lt;/em> we see along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s such a good show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to what they do with Season 2. What changes&amp;hellip; and what stays the same?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Father's Dragon</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/my-fathers-dragon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/my-fathers-dragon/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a cute story, good for children.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A story about the narrator&amp;rsquo;s father&amp;rsquo;s adventures, gone fantastic. There are talking animals and a dragon and it&amp;rsquo;s never really clear how much if any of this might have happened&amp;hellip; but in the end, does it matter?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s cute and teaches kids how to solve problems, make new friends, and rescue dragons. All lessons worth learning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Alien</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/the-alien/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/16/the-alien/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need.&amp;rdquo; A famous human named Rolling Stones said that. I thought it was very wise, for a human.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>From the Earth Diary of Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Our first point of view of Ax. Who&amp;rsquo;s an alien (oh so alien).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Here, just take the box,&amp;rdquo; Marco said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He handed me the box of popcorn. I quickly ate the rest of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Not the box,&amp;rdquo; Marco wailed. &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t eat the box!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It tasted of salt and grease,&amp;rdquo; I pointed out.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun look at cultural differences. I generally think that the series badly overdoes how he&amp;rsquo;s constantly reacting to things like speaking/eating/standing on two legs, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun to see it from his point of view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Culturally, we do get a decent bit of interesting story building here. What makes humans interesting in this universe. What Andelite culture is built on. What families are like. Etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m glad that the core conflict doesn&amp;rsquo;t (for the most part) get drug beyond one book. That would get tiring.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Andalite's Gift</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/12/the-andalites-gift/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/12/the-andalites-gift/</guid><description>&lt;p>The first &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/megamorphs/">Megamorphs&lt;/a> book&amp;ndash;with the point of view switching each chapter rather than per book&amp;ndash;and almost twice as long! (apparently it was originally published as two books?) It&amp;rsquo;s a neat concept and a good way to shake up the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than that, it&amp;rsquo;s summer time. The Animorphs are coming off a &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/11/the-stranger/">big win&lt;/a>. So it&amp;rsquo;s time to relax.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until a living tornado from Saturn comes to visit&amp;ndash;seemingly focussed on finding and shredding our friendly neighborhood Animorphs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, an amnesia plot. Which morphing for some reason didn&amp;rsquo;t heal?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; fine? The other &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/megamorphs/">Megamorphs&lt;/a> books are better.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lost City</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/11/lost-city/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/11/lost-city/</guid><description>&lt;p>Given how super formulaic these books are, I was actually really surprised with how &lt;em>good&lt;/em> this one is. You have a (very) old arms family with a flare for the dramatic, the lost city (no, not &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that one&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_City_Hydrothermal_Field" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one&lt;/a>), killer &amp;hellip; algae?, all the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar%20Allen%20Poe">Edgar Allen Poe&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Island%20of%20Dr.%20Moreau">The Island of Dr. Moreau&lt;/a> references you could want (plus some!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man there are some awesome action scenes in this book (which is really a large part about why you read them). Escaping from the castle? Excellent. (Actually the whole castle scene leading up to it was delightfully creepy). Escaping from the island? Even better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I had vaguely considered giving up on this series after the last few, but this one is more than good enough to keep me going for a while longer. Onward and NUMAward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Stranger</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/11/the-stranger/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/11/the-stranger/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Hi, Josep,&amp;gt; I said, using thought-speak.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What the . . . Who? Who said that? I&amp;rsquo;m hearing voices!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Me,&amp;gt; I replied. &amp;lt;I said it. See, Josep, I am from the International Elephant Police. We have had some complaints about you.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This is crazy! This is crazy! What are you? Is this some sort of a joke?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; remember that big weird biomechanical appearance at the end of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/09/the-capture/">The Capture&lt;/a>?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I am an Ellimist,&amp;rdquo; he said, speaking with an actual voice, &amp;ldquo;as your Andalite friend guessed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ax was shaking so badly he looked like he might fall down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Be at peace, Andalite,&amp;rdquo; the Ellimist said. &amp;ldquo;Look at your human friends. They do not fear me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;They don&amp;rsquo;t know what you are,&amp;gt; Ax managed to say.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ellimist smiled. &amp;ldquo;Neither do you. All you know are the fairy stories your people tell to children.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I remember The Ellimist Chronicles being one of my favorite books of the series. I did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> remember that they showed up quite so early. An interesting bit of worldbuilding, if nearing on an almost &lt;em>literal&lt;/em> deus-ex-machina.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a good book, but it&amp;rsquo;s tonally weird compared to any of the books thus far&amp;ndash;quite a jump in scope/scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although I do like Rachel&amp;rsquo;s cover / new combat morph though. Not &lt;em>quite&lt;/em> as many size issues as she had with the elephant.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Capture</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/09/the-capture/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/09/the-capture/</guid><description>&lt;p>A look far deeper than anyone wanted into what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be a Yeerk/controller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And some actual &lt;em>plans&lt;/em> to take over some more high powered individuals than High School kids and Assistant Principals. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an intense book, only slightly weakened by a few &amp;lsquo;unlikely at best&amp;rsquo; moments that are needed to drive the plot forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a good one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Message</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/05/the-message/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/05/the-message/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;How about my dream of living long enough to get a driver&amp;rsquo;s license?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so we have upper bound on their current ages. They&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em>so&lt;/em> young&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On re-reading this, I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten how early Ax was introduced. It&amp;rsquo;s such a neat story. The young alien left behind. Another child, just like them. And then you have the ocean morphs&amp;ndash;dolphins!&amp;ndash;and talking(ish) whales.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot to like about this one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Encounter</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/04/the-encounter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/04/the-encounter/</guid><description>&lt;p>Tobias, this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He&amp;rsquo;s such a fascinating character. In the very first book he broke the number one rule of morphing&amp;ndash;if you stay in morph for more than two hours, you&amp;rsquo;re stuck like that. Forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now Tobias is a red-tailed hawk, with the mind of a boy (and also somewhat a hawk, because that&amp;rsquo;s how morphing works).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which is just such a fascinating way to do it. And leads to some really interesting digging into what it actually even means to be human&amp;hellip; and what it might mean to lose that little bit of yourself&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It worried me a little. It made me wonder. Was he right about other things as well?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How many risks could we take before we lost? How long till the five of us were four? Or two?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or none?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And now we have more than 50 books to find out!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Visitor</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/02/the-visitor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/02/the-visitor/</guid><description>&lt;p>The one where the big bad alien controlled Assistant Principal&amp;hellip; has a touch of humanity after all.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;He wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Controller,&amp;rdquo; I said scornfully. &amp;ldquo;Why would the Yeerks want to make a Controller out of a punk? They want people in positions of power.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t know that for sure,&amp;rdquo; Jake said. &amp;ldquo;Tom isn&amp;rsquo;t in a position of power.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A good question that. Or why Chapman for that matter&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;em>so very&lt;/em> weird what random people the Yeerks chose to take over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a decent story. Making some Yeerks all the more terrifying while at the same time humanizing others. Makes everything all the more complicated&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Invasion</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/01/the-invasion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/01/the-invasion/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so&amp;hellip; the Animorphs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve read the entire series a couple times, but it&amp;rsquo;s also been at &lt;em>least&lt;/em> a decade. I remember that they&amp;rsquo;re very light reads, at times a bit dated (which I expect hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten better), and&amp;hellip; surprisingly good! Let&amp;rsquo;s see if they hold up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We start with &lt;em>The Invasion&lt;/em>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>5 kids walking home from the mall (do kids ever go to malls any more?) and stumble upon an alien. Dying from his wounds, hunted by his enemies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And oh what enemies they are&amp;hellip; the Yeerks. Alien slugs that can slither into your ear and take you over. And for some reason, they&amp;rsquo;re taking over this unspecified (probably West Coast US, we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that) small city, starting with&amp;hellip; high schoolers and Assistant Principals?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Big battle ensues, one alien kills another, but just before, the kids are given the power to fight back&amp;ndash;by turning (morphing) into any animal they can touch (acquire).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initially, they&amp;rsquo;re (rightfully) not willing to fight back, but of course things go sideways.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m sure we could talk them into letting us in for nothing,&amp;rdquo; Marco said. &amp;ldquo;Just tell them we&amp;rsquo;re Animorphs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Tell them we&amp;rsquo;re what?&amp;rdquo; Rachel asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Idiot teenagers with a death wish,&amp;rdquo; Marco said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Animorphs.&amp;rdquo; I tried the word out. It sounded okay.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And… so it begins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed it. And I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to re-reading the series!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2023 Year in Reviews</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/31/2023-year-in-reviews/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 23:59:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/31/2023-year-in-reviews/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so another year passes.

Also, if that weren’t enough, we have Basque independence and frankenfish!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s formulaic as any of these are and the inciting historical events are at once a bit weird&amp;ndash;and not nearly as earth shattering as they often are? This time around, the modern threat is perhaps a bigger one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s really not much more to say about these at this point. If you&amp;rsquo;ve liked the first three (or the whole of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/dirk-pitt/">Dirk Pitt&lt;/a>), you&amp;rsquo;ll probably enjoy this one!

&lt;p>I do enjoy the idea of a Storm Trooper just trying to do the right thing—that doesn’t actually join or even &lt;em>support&lt;/em> the Rebellion. It’s a neat story we haven’t gotten in the movies/TV (that I’ve seen).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s quite the mix and feels a bit disjoined, but I enjoyed it all well enough.

&lt;p>Heidi is just so innocent and fun. Her grandfather is the prototypical gruff old man with a heart of gold.

&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s not much in the way of plot, but that&amp;rsquo;s all right. You&amp;rsquo;re still going to get a chance to live vicariously through Heidi for a few hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s probably a lesson in there touching on ideas of homeschooling, parental rights, and living outdoors and off the land, but really, it&amp;rsquo;s more a matter of the times (written in 1880) than anything. Take it as you will.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this example, if you are at the node &lt;code>px&lt;/code>, if &lt;code>a &amp;lt; 2006&lt;/code>, move to &lt;code>qkq&lt;/code>. Otherwise, if &lt;code>m &amp;gt; 2090&lt;/code> move to &lt;code>A&lt;/code>. If no other case matches, the last defaults to &lt;code>rfg&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>A&lt;/code> and &lt;code>R&lt;/code> are special cases for accept and reject.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Calculate the sum of sum of all four ratings for all nodes that end at &lt;code>Accept&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At first, it&amp;rsquo;s more of the same. Jane dealing with vampire politics and her own love life as things just keep getting a bit crazier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then we learn that the European vampires are coming to visit. And they might just want to poke their noses into various artifacts Jane has picked up through the books&amp;ndash;or that Leo has and Jane hasn&amp;rsquo;t realized yet&amp;hellip; Including another big piece of vampire history.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And &lt;em>then&lt;/em> we get a whole deeper look into the metaphysics of the Jane&amp;rsquo;s universe. Light dragons. More about what the Mercy Blade actually is. More about Soul. And perhaps&amp;ndash;more about how Jane&amp;rsquo;s own history and powers might fit in with all of it. It&amp;rsquo;s going quite a different direction than most Urban Fantasy I&amp;rsquo;ve read and I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated to see where this is going.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus, it&amp;rsquo;s a major upgrade for Jane&amp;rsquo;s powers&amp;ndash;which she may very well need to survive&amp;ndash;even if it comes at quite the cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like I said, it gets crazier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And on top of all &lt;em>that&lt;/em>, we actually get a bit of a straight forward&amp;ndash;well, relative to what&amp;rsquo;s come before&amp;ndash;relationship for Jane!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“For a reason or a season,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;ldquo;For a year or a lifetime. For a poem or a song. For a victorious battle or a bloody death. For honor. I would stand by you for as long as I might live.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s about time&amp;hellip; I hope the best for them, at least for a little while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a crazy book and worth the read if you&amp;rsquo;ve already made it this far. Even if (minor spoilers) &amp;hellip; we don&amp;rsquo;t actually even &lt;em>get&lt;/em> to the European vampires for the most part!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: Almost the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2017/11/25/broken-souls/">second book by that title&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars: The Screaming Citadel</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/19/star-wars-the-screaming-citadel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/12/19/star-wars-the-screaming-citadel/</guid><description>&lt;p>Crossover!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-the-screaming-citadel-3fa8e3.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Doctor Aphra… and Black Krrsantan? (And the droids of course).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That certainly has potential! Force Vampires! (of course that’s a thing) The titular “Screaming Citadel”—delightfully Gothic. Mind control brain crabs. It’s got it all!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a little ridiculous at times and leans &lt;em>far&lt;/em> more into the fantasy side of Star Wars, but I enjoyed it.&lt;/p>

I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve read this one before, but that&amp;rsquo;s sort of the appeal of all of these books&amp;ndash;some quasihistorical inciting incident (that happens on or near the oceans) then jump to the present time to find the resulting shipwreck and deal with the secret organization (for example) that&amp;rsquo;s trying to RULE THE WORLD.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time with more Russia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have the daughters of Nikolai II, last Emperor of Russia&amp;ndash;on the run with all the royal jewels, including one very shiny crown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cut to the modern era, we have a Russian spy who&amp;rsquo;s gone toe to toe with Kurt Austin several times over the years, a manic trying to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/methane%20clathrate">blow up the ocean floor&lt;/a> and cause &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsunamis">tsunamis&lt;/a>, and gangs of modern neo-&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossacks">Cossacks&lt;/a> trying to bring back Mother Russia.&lt;/p>

&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-2015-v5-c45575.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I’m not sure who’s the worse off for it. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s not &lt;em>entirely&lt;/em> clear if Darth Vader recognizes him or not. With as many memory wipes as C-3PO has apparently gone through, it’s worth wondering if he’s still even the same as he was when Anakin first built him…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But really, in an interesting sort of flip, most of this volume is the backstory! And—as might be hinted at by the title—we actually get pre-Prequel era Yoda! And Qui-Gon Jinn. Now I want to read more Qui-Gon Jinn stories. I wonder if that’s a thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, Yoda on a planet of feral—and force sensitive because of course—children. Because of course that’s a story that has to be in the Star Wars canon. It actually gets far more interesting that I expected, but as Star Wars (outside of the movies) seems wont to do… things get &lt;em>weird&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a fascinating story, but again falls a bit into ‘just how much did Luke do outside of the movies’ trap that just feels weird.&lt;/p>
