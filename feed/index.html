&lt;p>No one ever has the right to take the life of another.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But perhaps, sometimes, you do have the responsibility to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that&amp;hellip; was certainly a show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an absolutely fascinating combination of weird anime sci-fi and more than a touch of weird western. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a few memorable characters (some perhaps&amp;hellip; too memorable), some weirdly wonderful worldbuilding and setting moments, and all sorts of gunfights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I can really recommend it. It started out weird, took a while to make any particular sense, and just when I felt it was getting there&amp;hellip; it ended. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly interesting, I&amp;rsquo;ll give it that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few question I still have after the show (spoilers):&lt;/p>
&lt;span class="spoiler">Where in the world did the names Vash and Millions Knives even come from? They're so different.&lt;/span>
&lt;p>And:&lt;/p>
&lt;span class="spoiler">Who (or what) were the Gung-Ho Guns? Literal demons? Natives? Weird humanity?

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so it ends. The second era of one of the more ambitious ideas in fantasy: take a fantasy world with a hard/scientific magic system (or three), tell a crazy story in that world, and then advance a few hundred years so that the first story becomes the myths and religions of the world. Not only that, but (specifically in the Lost Metal), take that same idea and expand it across a shared universe of fantasy worlds, each with their own feel and magic and start really bringing things in from other worlds, mashing them together and seeing just what sort of madness pops out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/12/snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/12/snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs/</guid><description>&lt;p>An almost 100 year old movie, based on a story likely at least a century older, combining aspects of stories who knows how old, animated for the modern (of the time) movie going audience.

While they&amp;rsquo;ve certainly got their problems (the rather traditional gender roles and Disney&amp;rsquo;s ongoing copyright battles to name a pair), they&amp;rsquo;re still something elegant and innocent about them and Snow White is no exception.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 11: Apocalypse</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/12/the-unwritten-vol.-11-apocalypse/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/11/12/the-unwritten-vol.-11-apocalypse/</guid><description>&lt;p>It all comes together in the end.

&lt;p>And of course, for the biggest story: the Grail (and the other stories based on it and based upon it). Or is it a drum? A trumpet? The Trumpet?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/unwritten-11-8fd281.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/unwritten-10-ef6c92.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it only gets weirder from there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/unwritten-10-381f87.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good choice of story though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/unwritten-10-01d658.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yup. That&amp;rsquo;s Aslan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course it&amp;rsquo;s going to take quite a story to get back to the &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; world from Fables&amp;hellip; But in a good way.

&lt;p>The trees were full of crows and the woods were full of madmen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pit was full of bones and her hands were full of wires.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that was a delightful surprise&amp;ndash;in a dark fairytale kind of way. I&amp;rsquo;ve not read any T. Kingfisher before, but I&amp;rsquo;ll have to remedy that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, Nettle &amp;amp; Bone takes the idea of a fairy godmother&amp;rsquo;s blessing at birth and twists it, bringing in the politics of unequal neighboring kingdoms; fae, their bargains, and all the twists that go with that; and a touch of demons and death magic. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun world to build a foundation on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, it&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful cast of characters. I love seeing Marra, third-born princess, sent to a religious order (sort of), and originally on her own to solve the world&amp;rsquo;s problems. Only for her to collect a motley band of strange and wonderful allies, each in their own ways: a witch, a reluctant godmother, a night, a dog made of bones, and a demon made of chicken. (It makes sense). They&amp;rsquo;re all great and I love the found family dynamic as they&amp;rsquo;re off to save the world&amp;ndash;or at least some tiny corner of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As if that weren&amp;rsquo;t enough, I love the prose and wordplay. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>written&lt;/em> like a fairytale writ large. It just fits the story so well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, One of the best books I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year and more than worth giving it a try.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 9: The Unwritten Fables</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/24/the-unwritten-vol.-9-the-unwritten-fables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/24/the-unwritten-vol.-9-the-unwritten-fables/</guid><description>&lt;p>Wait&amp;hellip; &lt;em>that&lt;/em> Fables. Confused for a bit. Those people all sounded familiar&amp;hellip; but not from Unwritten.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/unwritten-9-8c2e37.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not at all what I expected, but most appreciated. It&amp;rsquo;s great to see a number of old faces again, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I read Fables. They fit together about as strangely as you&amp;rsquo;d imagine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s fascinating bit of historical fantasy. Take revolutionary era France, introduce various relatively &amp;lsquo;common&amp;rsquo; classes of magicians (fire, water, weather, mind control, etc), and see what shakes out. It&amp;rsquo;s an era of history I&amp;rsquo;m probably not as familiar with as I should be and, while with the introduction of magic things are slightly different, the events actually shake out more or less the same way (as I looked up later). It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to read about people such as William Pitt and Maximilien Robespierre &amp;hellip; and then read about them again in real history.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Call of the Bone Ships</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/call-of-the-bone-ships/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/call-of-the-bone-ships/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/03/the-bone-ships/">The Bone Ships&lt;/a>&lt;/em> introduced us to the world&amp;ndash;where the bones of gigantic sea dragons once provided the building materials for ships, with hints of something even darker and more interesting going on in the background.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Call of the Bones Ships&lt;/em> takes up that up another level, really digging more into the often twisted politics and future of the world. It manages to give us quite a bit more insight into Joron Twiner, who is forced rather handedly to come into his own&amp;ndash;with whatever that ends up meaning&amp;ndash;and torturing him rather much along the way. We also get a lot of more of the gullaime (and the Gullaime specifically). There&amp;rsquo;s still a lot more to unpack there, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking for the third.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It ends up being rather a darker book, which fits even better as the successor to the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, wonderful worldbuilding, a darker tone, fascinating characters, and worth the re-read. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 8: Orpheus in the Underworld</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/22/the-unwritten-vol.-8-orpheus-in-the-underworld/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/22/the-unwritten-vol.-8-orpheus-in-the-underworld/</guid><description>&lt;p>A journey to Hell&amp;hellip; and a few faces we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in a while.

Let&amp;rsquo;s take what we did last time with &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/04/solving-sudoku-again/">Solving Sudoku (again)&lt;/a> and improve the code structure a bit more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Create a &amp;lsquo;Solver&amp;rsquo; struct that can maintain state (such as how many states we&amp;rsquo;ve visited, how much time we&amp;rsquo;ve spent)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Track the above stats&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Turn the &amp;lsquo;Solver&amp;rsquo; into an iterator which will iterate through given solutions (a single call will give the first solution or you can run through the iterator to get all of them)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;d like to follow along, I&amp;rsquo;ve started uploading the code here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/rust-solvers">https://github.com/jpverkamp/rust-solvers&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>She-Hulk: Attorney at Law</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/14/she-hulk-attorney-at-law/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/14/she-hulk-attorney-at-law/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not easy being green.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a strange one. She&amp;rsquo;s the Hulk&amp;rsquo;s cousin. One things lead to another, and she gets all Hulked out&amp;hellip; but without any of the downsides?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The contrast between being a Hulk and being a lawyer (and being a big green lawyer) is pretty cool, Tatiana Maslany does a wonderful job in the titular role, and it was great fun to see Tim Roth&amp;rsquo;s Abomination again, not to mention Charlie Cox&amp;rsquo;s Daredevil. Fun casting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s a really weird show. And they&amp;rsquo;re rather solidly into the whoe 4th wall breaking thing, which is kind of amusing. Weird. But amusing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I enjoyed the show. Not my favorite of the MCU TV shows, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have watched it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Boys: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/09/the-boys-season-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/09/the-boys-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve previously watched the first season and read the comics, but with season 3 out now (and I haven’t reviewed the show previously), let’s watch it again.

That&amp;rsquo;s one major tear jerker of an intro. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even need words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest of the movie is a pretty fun romp of an adventure as well. The old man, too old for this crap / young boy just trying so very hard to do the right thing is great; the talking collars and how dogs think is hilarious; and the adventurey bits are solid and almost too exciting (depending on the age of the viewers).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds playing a guy named Guy in a game&amp;ndash;but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t realize it. It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a lot of fun. Once you get the basic idea, you&amp;rsquo;ve got pretty much the entire plot, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun and well done.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Far beneath the surface of the earth, hidden from the sun and the moon, upon the shores of the Starless Sea, there is a labyrinthine collection of tunnels and rooms filled with stories. Stories written in books and sealed in jars and painted on walls. Odes inscribed onto skin and pressed into rose petals. Tales laid in tiles upon the floors, bits of plot worn away by passing feet. Legends carved in crystal and hung from chandeliers. Stories catalogued and cared for and revered. Old stories preserved while new stories spring up around them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The Starless Sea&lt;/em> is an unfortunate sort of book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, the prose is beautiful. There are some really wonderful passages and smaller stories that really sing on the pages. On top of that, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of delightful visuals described from the book. Often times, I don&amp;rsquo;t really picture what&amp;rsquo;s going on in a lot of stories, I more&amp;hellip; absorb them. But this, this really needs and thrives on the visuals. Especially leaning on the sights and smells of books and libraries and doors, it&amp;rsquo;s the sort of book a physical book lover (not a lover of stories, one of the actual physical books themselves) could really get into.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand&amp;hellip; even after reading through the entire book, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what in the world was going on / what the point of anything was. A book doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to have a point&amp;ndash;I do love a good slice of life story&amp;ndash;but this felt like it was trying to go for something. But with the absolute pile of characters (major, minor, versions of the same) jumping around all the time, it was hard to figure anything out. The prose and settings almost do enough to overcome that&amp;hellip; but not quite enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s a book that was almost really really good&amp;hellip; but didn&amp;rsquo;t quite stick the landing for me. It&amp;rsquo;s probably worth a try, but if you bounce off the first few chapters, consider that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really change that much before the end.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unwritten, Vol. 6: Tommy Taylor and the War of Words</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-unwritten-vol.-6-tommy-taylor-and-the-war-of-words/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-unwritten-vol.-6-tommy-taylor-and-the-war-of-words/</guid><description>&lt;p>The story is going now.

&lt;p>Saints become martyrs before they get to be heroes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure what to expect. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t actually read the books (although now I really wanted to) and for the first episode or two, I really thought it was some sort of cheesy YA fantasy, a la Hunger Games and the ilk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But a few episodes in&amp;hellip; and it really started to grow on me. The world building is fascinating, primarily the basis on a broad Asian setting, but with an emphasis on Russian roots, with some influences (in other nations) from China and India. The magic system is a bit cheesey and somewhat unexplained (so far), but at the very least it&amp;rsquo;s pretty?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, you have absolutely wonderful characters/actors. Jessie Mei Li nails it as lead Alina Starkov, Ben Barnes as General Kirigan&amp;ndash;plays his character rather well (&lt;span class="spoiler">he actually has the gravitas of old, powerful, and twisted, which not everyone can pull off&lt;/span>
). But the ones that really shine are the Crows (I don&amp;rsquo;t think they&amp;rsquo;re referred to as such in the show?): Freddy Carter as Kaz, Amita Suman as Inej and Kit Young as Jesper. There are rumors that they might get their own show and that would be &lt;strong>awesome&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, worth a watch. And we&amp;rsquo;re getting Season 2, hopefully sometime next year? Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lunar Arithmetic in Rust</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/21/lunar-arithmetic-in-rust/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/21/lunar-arithmetic-in-rust/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with various languages / language design a lot recently (inspired by my Runelang series).

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a very cool root for the story and Barker only takes it from there with unique twists on vocab and word choice, a few other interesting bits of magic, and more naval everything than you can shake some paint at.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do quite enjoy the characters as well. Setting the story around a prison ship? Not that unusual, but I really do love how much Barker makes the reader care for the people on it&amp;ndash;and to see them grow together as a grow. Lucky Maes is of course awesome as well&amp;ndash;and I do love the more alien birdman. Want to see what more is going on there for sure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a great book and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have read it. Onward to the sequels!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Canticle for Leibowitz</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/31/a-canticle-for-leibowitz/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/31/a-canticle-for-leibowitz/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But neither infinite power nor infinite wisdom could bestow godhood upon men. For that there would have to be infinite love as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That was an interesting book. In a nutshell, humanity finally managed to blow ourselves up&amp;ndash;and then the story begins. Years after Armageddon, we pick up with a religious order founded to preserve knowledge (a worthwhile goal).&lt;/p>

This time, let&amp;rsquo;s make &amp;lsquo;summoning circles&amp;rsquo;. Basically, we want to make a circle with stars and other circles inscribed and around the borders with various &amp;lsquo;mystic&amp;rsquo; text in the mix. Something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>generate_summoning_circle&lt;/code>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>random chance of boder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>random chance of one or more inscribed stars&lt;/li>
&lt;li>random chance of recurring on the border (calling &lt;code>generate_summoning_circle&lt;/code> again)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>random chance of recurring in the middle&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I was expecting, but for what they are&amp;hellip; they&amp;rsquo;re cute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth the 15 minutes to watch them all. :D&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fruits Basket: Season 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/27/fruits-basket-season-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/27/fruits-basket-season-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I started the second season&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, we do get a bit of backstory with parent issues (oh so many parent issues), the rest of the zodiac (more or less), and some answers about Akito.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, there are piles of weird age issues (I know this is apparently an anime staple; that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it better) and episode after episode dedicated to &amp;hellip; the student council of all things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We made it through 15 episodes of this season. Fin. Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Runelang: A Bind Rune Generator</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/25/runelang-a-bind-rune-generator/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/25/runelang-a-bind-rune-generator/</guid><description>&lt;p>Continuing with my &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/series/runelang-in-the-browser/">Runelang in the Browser&lt;/a> series, I had the idea to automatically generate runes. So basically reversing the parsing step, rather than to take what I&amp;rsquo;ve written and make it look good, to write something that Runelang can parse&amp;ndash;and still look good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, I want to write a series of functions that can recursively call one another to render runes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>generate_bind_rune&lt;/code>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>n&lt;/em> times &lt;code>generate_bind_rune_arm&lt;/code>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>m&lt;/em> times generate bars, circles, and other decrations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add a fork at the end&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Everything Everywhere All at Once</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/23/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/08/23/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/</guid><description>&lt;p>Laundry and taxes. Hotdog fingers and Raccacoonie. Googly third eyes and sex toy fueled kung fu fights. The truest &lt;em>everything&lt;/em> bagel there ever was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well that was a delightfully &lt;em>weird&lt;/em> movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If anything at all of that sounds interesting (especially the &lt;em>weird&lt;/em> part) and you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen this movie yet, go see it. Don&amp;rsquo;t spoil it.

Between the two, they&amp;rsquo;re either my top or second favorite urban fantasy series out there (the other being the Dresden Files) and I&amp;rsquo;ve reread each a number of times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around though, I decided to hit all of the short stories and novellas as well, primarily collected in &lt;em>Shifting Shadows&lt;/em>. Rather than one post per book, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to put them all in this one post, ordered chronologically within the Mercyverse. Any I haven&amp;rsquo;t read yet, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave as placeholders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good stories all and none seem critical for enjoying the main series if you skip over them. A bit more backstory, particularly for more minor characters though, which is appreciated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll try for minor spoilers at most, but I&amp;rsquo;m not always the most caring about that. :D&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
