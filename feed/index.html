&lt;p>I love it. It’s relatively lower stakes. Gives Peter and MJ some time to breathe. Builds the conflict between Peter in school and as Spider-Man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus, funny foreign accent guy is amusing and we get an X-Men crossover.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good one.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s not hard, but it&amp;rsquo;s something that I really wanted to do and had to look up where it was, so perhaps it will help you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Problem statement:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I run a bunch of local services in my network. They aren&amp;rsquo;t exposed publicly (I use Wireguard to access them when out and about), so I really don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>need&lt;/em> HTTPS. But (rightfully) a number of services behave better when they&amp;rsquo;re behind HTTPS + if there&amp;rsquo;s ever a service that&amp;rsquo;s running amuck (Internet of Things devices?) that&amp;rsquo;s listening, I don&amp;rsquo;t want them to see anything.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/nav>
&lt;h2 id="options">Options&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Option 1: Use Nginx Proxy Manager to request certificates for each subdomain. It works quickly and well. Problem: All certificates are published to Certificate Transparency Logs. I don&amp;rsquo;t immediately mind exposing what I&amp;rsquo;m running&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;d still rather now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Option 2: Set up wildcard certificates. This requires integration with your DNS provider (since wildcards need a DNS challenge, not TCP).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course (based on the title), we&amp;rsquo;re going with option 2. 😄&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automated transcripts from video with Whisper(.cpp)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/27/automated-transcripts-from-video-with-whisper.cpp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2023 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/27/automated-transcripts-from-video-with-whisper.cpp/</guid><description>&lt;p>I tend to be something of a digital packrat.

Far more than &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/consider-phlebas/">Consider Phlebas&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, the story follows Jernau Gurgeh, one of (if not the) best &amp;lsquo;Player of Games&amp;rsquo; in the entire Culture. We had a hint of how important games could be in Consider Phlebas, with the stakes literally being life and death (although not of the player, /of course/), but here we see it can be so much more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Gurgeh is &lt;em>really&lt;/em> into games.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I get that. I appreciate that. Games have this special spot in the universe. A microcosm of all that can be, following very specific and often completely knowable rules. It&amp;rsquo;s a way to compete (or co-operate (or both)) with other game players, to get to know them and the game you&amp;rsquo;re all playing together. Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s all about winning&amp;hellip; but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s so much more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Gurgeh gets that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So when he&amp;rsquo;s offered (when Special Circumstances offers&amp;hellip; you accept) to travel two years, almost out of the galaxy, to visit an alien empire where there is incredibly complicated thousand year old game that essentially dominates their entire society&amp;ndash;choosing their leaders, guiding their religious views.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, I love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the detail there, but the entire idea that a not entirely likeable (especially at first) player of games can be the protagonist. Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s just lovely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Easily my favorite book of the Culture so far (even if I&amp;rsquo;ve only read the two so far 😄). I really will have to check at the end if it stands up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 6: Return of the King</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/26/ultimate-x-men-vol.-6-return-of-the-king/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2023 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/26/ultimate-x-men-vol.-6-return-of-the-king/</guid><description>&lt;p>Wherein we get this universe’s history. How the a Professor and Magneto started out to build a mutant utopia, how some minor* differences in option came between them, and how Xavier ended up in a wheelchair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a nice longer story and I really do dig the conflict between the Professor and Magneto. There are also some really interesting ideas buried within the action. Ends justifying the means. The cost(s) of rehabilitation or even imprisonment of a super powered prisoner. What it means to be human.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A solid story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 5: Ultimate War</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/25/ultimate-x-men-vol.-5-ultimate-war/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/25/ultimate-x-men-vol.-5-ultimate-war/</guid><description>&lt;p>Magneto is back and &lt;strong>mad&lt;/strong>. The Brotherhood vs the Ultimates! The X-Men are nowhere to be found. At least not ent S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Probably for the best, given the various infighting and differences of opinion in each and every one of these groups. They really do their best to constantly shake up teams in comics, don’t they.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I never really had reason to consider before… you know what Captain America’s shield, Thor’s hammer, and Iron Man’s armor have in common?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They’re all made of metal…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately for all the promises, surprisingly little actually happens. It will be interesting to see what’s next… but something more now would have been nice.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If I were reading this book to my children, I imagine I would have liked it quite a bit more. It&amp;rsquo;s got the zany sort of weirdness that really appeals to children&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s in some ways much easier for them to jump from insane to imaginary, while at the same time not needing &lt;em>that&lt;/em> much of a reason for things to be like they are.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The whole land of Skree was green and flat. Except for the Stony Mountains in the north, which weren’t flat at all. Nor were they green. They were rather white from all the snow, though if the snow melted, something green might eventually grow there.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The entire prologue is like that. Prologue&lt;em>s&lt;/em>. There are 3 of them. And they&amp;rsquo;re all like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s amusing&amp;hellip; and then it&amp;rsquo;s too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>That evil was a nameless evil, an evil whose name was Gnag the Nameless.&lt;/p>

A dash of memory on tape: Peter’s father. And… apparently childhood friend Eddie Brock?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course one thing leads to another, they find the venom formula (SCIENCE this time, not alien; at least not that we know), and we very Venom suit Spider-Man. Only for a few moments and he’s already done with that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a bit quick to go from ‘oh hey, childhood friend you forgot’ to fighting Venom in the street, but I expect we’ll see more of him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus, an aside with Fury! And references to the events of the Ultimates!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-spider-man-v5-0468c7.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just can’t catch a break.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s nice to have a relatively low level, human story—even if we still absolutely get changes that are going to ripple through the rest of the storyline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Neuromancer</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/20/neuromancer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/20/neuromancer/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s the Matrix decades before the Matrix. Or at least a Matrix?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts&amp;hellip; A graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s cyberpunk in a nutshell. A gritty dark world where computers and virtual worlds play first class. In this case, there&amp;rsquo;s the Matrix. Basically the internet, but with better visuals. And of course, because this was written in the 80s, the only way to access it is jacking in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The terminology is at once futuristic and dated, but there&amp;rsquo;s only so much you can do when you write about &amp;rsquo;near&amp;rsquo; future worlds. Even the better racial stereotype (that&amp;rsquo;s a way to start a sentence&amp;hellip;) are dated if not outright cringe inducing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s mostly an action story. I didn&amp;rsquo;t care much if our protagonist lived or died&amp;hellip; but that&amp;rsquo;s okay, because he&amp;rsquo;s really just a vehicle for the story. Such is life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps my favorite part of the book is the descriptions and characterizations of the AIs. We live in world where AI is advancing in leaps and bounds, doing things AI creators in the 80s wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have imagined possible, while at the same time proving just how hard a problem it still is. In the case of Neuromancer though, the AIs feel almost Urban Fantasy style Fae. Alien, at a totally different scale, and terrifying. It works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not my favorite entry even into this sub-genre, but it&amp;rsquo;s also not at all a bad book. Worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Keyboard Chords with Hammerspoon</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/19/keyboard-chords-with-hammerspoon/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/19/keyboard-chords-with-hammerspoon/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love keyboard shortcuts.

&lt;p>Lol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He’s so young.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here we have them introductions of Gwen Stacy and Eddie Brock, Doc Oc—back from the dead, Kong being not quite so dumb as everyone thinks—but no one believes him, and… for some reason a guy in a fur cloak wants to hunt Spider-Man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel like these are by far the best paced of the Ultimate Marvel Universe comics so far. Plenty of action, but also time to see Parker being a kid, working a job, and introducing new characters.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s another intense story line and maybe actually shaking up a few things. I really am curious how they’ll continue to deal with Banner and Pym. Slowly I expect. But that works.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>And then finally, we’re on to the World Tour! It’s all about proving that mutants do good for the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What could possibly go wrong…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really do fall on the ‘Professor is being an overly pacifist idiot’ side of times things. It’ll be interesting to see what’s next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, these plots really could use some more time to breath. In the span of a single volume, we&amp;rsquo;re introduced to the idea of &lt;span class="spoiler">Professor X having a wife and child&lt;/span>

&lt;p>Good times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s another crazy action packed volume. I’m amazed at how much they’re fitting into these. Almost as amazed at how any of them are supposed to fit into those outfits…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, Weapon X, S.H.I.E.L.D., what’s left of the Brotherhood, and a few new friends all together. Learning just what lines they’ll each be willing to cross…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2022 Book Bingo Retrospective</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/13/2022-book-bingo-retrospective/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/13/2022-book-bingo-retrospective/</guid><description>BINGO!

Iron Man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole idea that they don’t know that Iron Man is a man in a suit rather than a robot and that for some reason Tony wants to keep it that way—and thinks that he can is a bit crazy to me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not to mention that the healing factor (and thus Tony’s disregard for getting hurt) still feels wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A really weird/rough way to take Iron Man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a bit of a bummer, since I enjoyed Card’s earlier writing (Ender’s game primarily) even if his later stuff got weird and preachy. But I still had hope…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ready to move on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Legends &amp; Lattes</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/12/legends-lattes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 00:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/12/legends-lattes/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>After twenty-two years of adventuring, Viv had reached her limit of blood and mud and bullshit. An ore&amp;rsquo;s life was strength and violence and a sudden, sharp end - but she&amp;rsquo;d be damned if she&amp;rsquo;d let hers finish that way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was time for something new.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A retired orc barbarian and a succubus with artistic flair open a coffee shop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nope, not even a joke. Instead, it’s the heart of one of the best examples of cozy fantasy I’ve read yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I haven’t even mentioned the ratkin with their heavenly cinnamon rolls, the hob carpenter (hm), and a shy bard with a flair for experimental music.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Iron Man, Vol. 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/12/ultimate-iron-man-vol.-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/12/ultimate-iron-man-vol.-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>That is not at all what I expected.

&lt;p>That is an awful lot to fit into a single volume…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The philosophical differences between Professor X and his X-Men versus Magneto and his Brotherhood is quite often at the core of these stories, so it’s no surprise to see it here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only question is… what comes next?!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Letters from a Shipwreck in the Sea of Suns and Moons</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/letters-from-a-shipwreck-in-the-sea-of-suns-and-moons/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 00:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/letters-from-a-shipwreck-in-the-sea-of-suns-and-moons/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We are the interviewers. For a story.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And who am I?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You are the old sailor who remembers being a young sailor on Unicorn, a three masted schooner out of San Francisco plying the Pacific waters.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That sounds familiar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You are Clarence St. Elmo, for a name. You are a bad poet lost in the sea of time, a castaway on an island where the dead gods wander.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That sounds awful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>And beyond a name, on that side of things, past the mirror and the window and the words, you are the Keeper of Shipwreck Light in the Sea of Suns and Moons.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, I knew that.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;hellip; is a truly delightfully weird book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It jumps around in structure and time between letters from a sailor to the girl he left back home&amp;ndash;to said sailor being interviewed by &amp;hellip; someone&amp;ndash;to stories about a most mysterious shipwreck and the island he came to inhabit thereafter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Structurally, it&amp;rsquo;s very strange and at times hard to figure out what in the world is going on&amp;ndash;but that&amp;rsquo;s all intentional. It&amp;rsquo;s really quite worth it in the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s not much more I can say without spoiling the whole thing&amp;ndash;that is, if I really actually understood what and how, if anything, of the story actually happened. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Consider Phlebas</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/consider-phlebas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 00:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/consider-phlebas/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Culture: a &amp;ldquo;a utopian, post-scarcity space society of humanoid aliens, and advanced superintelligent artificial intelligences living in artificial habitats spread across the Milky Way galaxy&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture%20series">Culture series&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Besides, it left the humans in the Culture free to take care of the things that really mattered in life, such as sports, games, romance, studying dead languages, barbarian societies and impossible problems, and climbing high mountains without the aid of a safety harness.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;d think (or at least I did) from that description that we&amp;rsquo;d have everything starting in a state of wonder and harmony&amp;hellip; and only then watch things go to hell (because otherwise, where&amp;rsquo;s the story?).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So imagine my surprise where (in Consider Phlebas), we start in the middle of a war between the Culture and another group (the Idirans) told from the point of a view of a shape shifting secret agent (more or less) who ends up with a crew of mercenaries (no, they&amp;rsquo;re a &amp;lsquo;Free Company&amp;rsquo;), goes through a few disastrous missions with them, almost gets eaten by a disgusting gigantic blob of a religious cult leader, breaks into a card game where the stakes are real human lives, and finally comes back to a graveyard system and then just about everyone dies.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Experience as well as common sense indicated that the most reliable method of avoiding self-extinction was not to equip oneself with the means to accomplish it in the first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I &amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t even know what to say.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Elektra: Devil's Due</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/ultimate-elektra-devils-due/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 00:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/ultimate-elektra-devils-due/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-elektra-70326f.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing bad ever came of a ‘who can you trust?’&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The contrast between Matt Murdock and Elektra is really what sells these stories. Doing what’s right versus what needs to be done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope to see more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if Kingpin is involved…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Daredevil &amp; Elektra</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/ultimate-daredevil-elektra/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/ultimate-daredevil-elektra/</guid><description>&lt;p>Only &lt;strike>one volume&lt;/strike> two volumes. Interesting. Let’s go!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-daredevil-and-elektra-c573e5.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Elektra making new friends at college.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-daredevil-and-elektra-f7b716.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And a younger than I’m used to Matt Murdock, already fighting crime and just starting in on the law stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course things escalate quickly and of course something has to drive them apart. One of the rules of comics it seems. No one can be happy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope we see more of them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 2: Learning Curve</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/10/ultimate-spider-man-volume-2-learning-curve/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/10/ultimate-spider-man-volume-2-learning-curve/</guid><description>&lt;p>Spider-Man starts to settle in to his new life. School, a job, a bit of light vigilantism, perhaps a date with MJ…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and of course decides to set his sights on the big man himself: Mr. Fisk. Kingpin. He’s a personal favorite big (heh) bad of mine. So I’m looking forward to where this goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also I’m enjoying the teenage dynamic. So far as I’m concerned they nailed it. It’s insane, what he’s trying to do… but it feels so right.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But you have to start somewhere right? It’s a solid story, I like the art, and we’re setting up for something big.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are no secrets, there is no mystery. We make that all up. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s all right there in front of us. You have to have enough food to get through winter and spring. That&amp;rsquo;s what it all comes down to. You have to live in a way that will gather enough food each fall to get through winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Take a survival story (a la Gary Paulsen&amp;rsquo;s Hatchet), re-tune it for a world where survival is life rather than a temporary situation (ten thousand or so years ago), sprinkle in an oddly modern feeling narrator, and make it super horny&amp;hellip; voila. Shaman.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I at once rather enjoyed it and was rather annoyed by good parts of it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Runaways, Vol. 11: Homeschooling</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/06/runaways-vol.-11-homeschooling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 00:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/06/runaways-vol.-11-homeschooling/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/runaways-v11-8a6ca4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/runaways-v9-f542e7.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And quite a cosmic plot line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do you even deal with billions dead somewhere out there across the universe?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and I feel like Chase got stupider. In a bad way.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“When Betsy is happy,” her mother said, “she is happier than anyone else in the world.” Then she added, “And she’s almost always happy.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A cute book to read with younger children. In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s the story about Tacy (she&amp;rsquo;s shy) and Betsy (she tells everyone that Tacy is shy). They go on adventures, have a clubhouse, and eventually find another new friend&amp;ndash;just in time to start another book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Runaways, Vol. 8: Dead End Kids</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/04/runaways-vol.-8-dead-end-kids/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/04/runaways-vol.-8-dead-end-kids/</guid><description>&lt;p>When you’re (perpetually) on the run and need a favor, who do you call?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kingpin… apparently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So of course things go all sorts of sideways. And of course time travel gets involved—because comics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Delightful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And so ends the 2005-2008 run.

&lt;p>Marigold took a deep breath. &amp;ldquo;My name is Marigold Ann Nightfield. I use she/her pronouns. I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD
candidate in biomedical science.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Laurel offered her hand across the table, and Marigold took it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Laurel Windflower. She/her as well.&amp;rdquo; She didn’t mention the incomplete MA she&amp;rsquo;d been postponing, for one reason or another, for the past two years. &amp;ldquo;So, is your PhD in monster biology or something?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That was delightful. It&amp;rsquo;s a cozy urban fantasy, light and cute with just enough touches of something bigger and more dangerous out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well worth a read. And at a novella length 100 pages, it&amp;rsquo;s worth trying just to see if you like it. And if you do, there are a handful more to dig deeper!

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m really only familiar with stories like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach. They&amp;rsquo;re certainly fantastical stories with a number of fairly subtle dark twists to them, but still well within the realm of children&amp;rsquo;s stories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well&amp;hellip; it turns out he wrote some more adult, much more tense ones at all. It&amp;rsquo;s somewhere in that border realm between realism, fantasy, and horror, not quite terrifying but certainly creepy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The stories are quick and always have the creepy sort of twist, although I&amp;rsquo;ll admit there were a few I just don&amp;rsquo;t really get. So it goes.

&lt;p>That never does go well. Plus short bits with Molly on her own and Karolina in space! The gang is back (ish)!&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy month with the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/series/genuary-2023/">Genuary&lt;/a> series and life in general, but I&amp;rsquo;m still thinking about Redis in general 😄.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Up this time, let&amp;rsquo;s see what the official &lt;code>redis-cli&lt;/code> app does when talking to our client and actually start handling some commands. Specifically, the very basic commands: &lt;code>SET&lt;/code> and &lt;code>GET&lt;/code>. With that, we would actually have a (very very basic) keystore up and running!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s a cute story, well contained with a bit leading up to what’s coming I’m looking forward to… but Karolina just vanishing into space was… kind of weird. I like her. Hope she’s back soon.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Bit more traditional super hero flare, but still with a Runaways twist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s a big bad in the future and our intrepid heroes(ish) have to find him as a teenager and … deal with him. Because that worked out so well the last two times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus all sorts of b-tier / c-tier hero cameos… I have no idea which of these were made up for this story and which have decades long comics ruins of their own. And some rather higher level villains about. Now that was a surprise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fun ride.&lt;/p>
