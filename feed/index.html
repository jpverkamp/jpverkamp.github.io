&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. That really went quite a fascinating direction. I was wondering where they were going for the last few seasons, but really digging into the aftermath of the season 1 hacks + another big target + dealing with the fallout of the Dark Army + digging deeper into Elliot&amp;rsquo;s troubles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man. Quite a season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had my doubts in the run up to the final few episodes, but I think they really stuck the landing. This was quite a show, through and through. Well worth the watch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know&amp;hellip; I should really re-watch those movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I expect is the case for many in roughly my age bracket, Harry Potter was a huge part of my life growing up. I think I got into it with the release of the 3rd or 4th book (can&amp;rsquo;t quite remember) and absolutely devoured each book after that the night it came out. I watched all of the movies a number of times. It was absolutely fascinating watching the characters in this other world basically growing up with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now&amp;hellip; 20 years later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker</title>

      <description>Given the internet&amp;rsquo;s backlast, I exepcted a lot worse. At least to me, The Rise of Skywalker did a pretty decent job of closing the loop on the saga that began a long time ago with the rise of Palpatine and the fall of Anakin Skywalker. Really, that&amp;rsquo;s the entire story, and you get that here in spades.
There were definitely some weird choices made in pacing (in particular, right at the beginning, they sort of drop the whole &amp;lsquo;Emperor is back&amp;rsquo; thing on us&amp;hellip; apparently the reveal came in &amp;hellip; Fortnite?</description>

      <description>One heck of a crazy longer story (Haunted, one of the best of that length) and a bunch of shorter ones, ranging from not much to really good.
Mini-reviews and pretty pictures (spoilers):
Haunted That’s a story. Enough time to breathe, a cast of new and interesting story, and all sorts of gross and creepy scenes.
Part One Oy. Although you can’t say she’s wrong.
Murder scene description: oy that’s graphic.</description>

      <description>Three multiple parters? No single issues? Sweet. Up the Down Staircase want my favorite, but both How to Play with Fire and Son of Man were excellent.
Mini reviews, pretty (horrifying) pictures and spoilers:
Up the Down Staircase Memes? I feel like I missed something. Interesting character development, but no real pay off.
Part One You are dating the wrong man.
Other than that, we have a fairly standard meet the family type scene.</description>

      <description>More Star Wars! I remember being&amp;hellip; somewhat disappointed. Tonally, they got away from the nostalgia of the Force Awakens. There are still some absolutely beautiful/powerful moments (the final battles over the salt flats or whatever those were were pretty cool), but not quite as strong as it was before. And there are all sorts of things that just feel &amp;lsquo;less magical&amp;rsquo; and more movie driven than anything.
This time around, I liked it a lot more.</description>

      <description>Woo, new Star Wars! I remember the hype when The Force Awakens first came out. It was pretty crazy to see new Star Wars for the first time (second time?) in years. And it&amp;rsquo;s pretty dang cool. It&amp;rsquo;s shinier than the original trilogy, a bit less stuck in the weeds (trade blockades!) than the prequels, and it leans hard on nostalgia. Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s Star Wars! Could they have done something newer and more unique?</description>

      <description>A solid one. Big stories are interesting, little ones are touching_weird_sweet, and Constantine’s got some new people and problems to deal with. Nothing too surreal either, which I appreciate.
Mini-reviews (spoilers):
Days of Wine and Roses A little bit of Constantine, a little bit of regular human terror.
The Wild Hunt Oh my.
Also: Colts!
Last Man Standing Argue and his men as ancient immortals? Merlin as a dragon?</description>

      <description>Not really sure what to say about this one. It&amp;rsquo;s the Nativity story told from the point of view of various animals, voiced by a few famous people (Kris Kristofferson as &amp;lsquo;Old Donkey&amp;rsquo; was pretty awesome&amp;hellip; also Oprah apparently?).
It&amp;rsquo;s a cute enough story and the kids enjoy it. The songs are a nice touch.
I expect this will be fairly low on my list for the year, mostly since I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;hellip; not really the target audience.</description>

      <description>Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s nostalgia speaking, but I really miss the 1966 How the Grinch Stole Christmas! It was basically a reading of the book with a great narrator (Boris Karloff, who amusingly is best known for a bunch of 1930-40s horror films) and a few new songs that really fit the Seuss style. Given that the Grinch is probably in my top 5 Seuss books overall, of course I like it.</description>

      <description>Fortune telling, Constantine’s father, more evil demons and arguably worse angels, and of course dead soldiers who can’t find rest.
Not a standout volume, but still pretty good.
Mini reviews (spoilers):
The Nature of the Beast Sure…
Reading the future is a common enough trope in this genre, but I enjoyed it.
Walking the Dog Another ghost story&amp;hellip;
…ish.
Oops. A neat twist.

      <description>I do a post each year on books, but this year I also started reviewing movies and TV shows! I have absolutely no idea how much value people get out of this (and I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you), but I enjoy doing it, so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to stop any time soon. :D
In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s been a good year for movies and TV!
Overall, I watched:

      <title>2021 Reading Retrospective</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well. That was a year. Covid, take 2. A new job. A new baby. I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite make my 200 books this year (I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite even make it to 1/2 days), but that&amp;rsquo;s okay. I still read a giant pile. :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some stats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;179 books read: 1 every 2.04 days (almost!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;47,236 pages read: roughly 130 pages/day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;29 audiobooks, 96 graphic novels, 18 children&amp;rsquo;s chapter books, 18 non-fiction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;56 unique authors (top were Hajime Isayama, Patricia Briggs, Warren Ellis, and Neil Gaiman)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;19 series (top were Attack on Titan, Mercy Thompson/Alpha &amp;amp; Omega, Sandman, and Runelords)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortest: &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/21/the-shepherds-tale/&#34;&gt;The Shepherd&amp;#39;s Tale&lt;/a&gt; with 56 pages, longest: &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/the-holy-bible-revised-standard-version-catholic-edition/&#34;&gt;The Holy Bible: Revised Standard Version, Catholic Edition&lt;/a&gt; with over 1000. That feels like cheating though, so let&amp;rsquo;s go with &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/21/rhythm-of-war/&#34;&gt;Rhythm of War&lt;/a&gt; at 1270 / &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/12/crafting-interpreters/&#34;&gt;Crafting Interpreters&lt;/a&gt; at 865. 😄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most read book I read this year was &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/23/1984/&#34;&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt; with 5 million others reading it (on Goodreads alone; I was working on my earliest backlog). Least popular: &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/26/tales-of-nezura-book-1-the-zevolra/&#34;&gt;Tales of Nezura: Book 1: The Zevolra&lt;/a&gt; with only 39. It &amp;hellip; wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad. Give it a try?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I gave 119 five-star ratings, 45 four-star, 7 three-star, and less than 10 other ratings. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the realization over the last year that I tend to like just about everything. Books in particular, they&amp;rsquo;re only on my list if I think I&amp;rsquo;d find them interesting, so of course, they&amp;rsquo;ll be rated highly&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Two big stories, a few really trippy dreams, and Constantine managing to push off damnation a bit longer. A neat collection. Critical Mass in particular is worth the read.

      <description>No. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to review the Bible.
I did however, read the entire Bible this year (for the second time, first time with the additional Catholic books). This time around, guided by the excellent Bible in a Year podcast hosted by Fr. Mike Schmitz.
Over the course of the year, it goes through every single book in the Bible in a fairly well thought out order&amp;ndash;which certainly does make you realize just how much more of the Old Testament there is&amp;hellip; (For context, the OT is 3x as long as the NT.</description>

      <description>Whoa.
 Well that&amp;rsquo;s a blast of nostalgia, a bunch of mind-bending meta universe building, some awesome new characters, a few solid action scenes, and overall quite an action movie. I loved it.
It&amp;rsquo;s been more than 20 years. I have seen the original Matrix more times than I can easily remember and loved both sequels (even if they didn&amp;rsquo;t shine quite as bright). When they said they were making another one&amp;hellip; I had no idea how in the world they were going to make that possibly work.</description>

      <description>As much as I loved Spider-Man: Homecoming, Spider-Man: Far From Home takes what made it great and turns it up a few levels even further.
One one level, you have Spider-Man being Spider-Man. He&amp;rsquo;s a good kid, trying to make his way in life, trying to deal with the dual life of being a highschooler and being a superhero&amp;ndash;of saving the world and perhaps getting the girl.
And then you layer all the weight of the greater MCU on top of it.</description>

      <description>That is a truly delightful Spider-Man movie. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird seeing him introduced after the events of Captain America: Civil War and completely skipping how he became Spider-Man in the first place&amp;hellip; but it works. I really like the entire plot, dealing with the fallout of the Avengers / super-hero activity and how normal people try to live their lives around it&amp;ndash;and what happens when the powers that be step in and take that away from them.</description>

      <description>The Wheel of Time turns, and ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of time.</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed Hawkeye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;, which compared to &lt;em&gt;Wandvision&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; and really even &lt;em&gt;What If&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; is a worthwhile goal and really does a lot to show off the more human scale of superheroes. It&amp;rsquo;s never really made much sense that Hawkeye and Black Widow were Avengers&amp;hellip; and it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t. But they do it anyways. Because what Heroes do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see them building up the new &amp;lsquo;Young Avengers&amp;rsquo; and branching out as much as they are. I think Hailee Steinfeld did a great job, especially when acting against &lt;span class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;Florence Pugh&#39;s Yelena&lt;/span&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that&amp;rsquo;s music. I can only imagine hearing that on a theater scale sound system. Although my home sound bar certainly tried it&amp;rsquo;s best&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I know I&amp;rsquo;m behind the times. Better late than never?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a solid movie that tries to make some big points about everyone having value / sticking it to the people that hate you because you&amp;rsquo;re different and&amp;hellip; mostly hitting the mark? It gets even more complicated when you read up on Barnum&amp;rsquo;s actual history. Very much a serial &amp;lsquo;get rich quick&amp;rsquo;er with some questionable ethics, but there&amp;rsquo;s good parts there as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh boy. This one really dug into the darker parts of character growth. Elliot finds new ways to be even crazier, Angela is&amp;hellip; off the rails entirely, Moustache Guy (Bobby Cannavale/Irvin) is awesome, and the entire plot of Darlene, Dominque, and the FBI was fascinating to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep being pleasantly surprised with where this show keeps going. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have expected them to make it past the first season plotwise&amp;hellip; yet here we are. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to where we can go from here!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;You know, that is a really solid movie. I know a lot of people prefer Empire, but for whatever reason, I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked Return of the Jedi more. That holds true even more, although I have to say that there are a few (possibly nostalgia fueled) particulars that I like more before the special editions changed things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Where Sons of the Oak could arguably considered a continuation of the first four books, what with references and plots revolving around the Earth King and his wife and a focus on Borenson, Myrrima, and their children, now in Worldbinder we&amp;rsquo;re really getting into the changes&amp;ndash;and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m okay with that.
For one, the first real &amp;lsquo;binding of worlds&amp;rsquo; happens fairly early in the book. In a nutshell, that means that any character alive in both worlds is now a mix of memories, experiences, et al of both characters, while those only in one are initially weaker for it.</description>

      <description>Cute enough. For the most part, it&amp;rsquo;s more Pippi stories, but they do finally get out of the town and go with Pippi and her father to the South Seas island where her father is king. Which&amp;hellip; is both the best and worst part of the book. It&amp;rsquo;s zany and fun in true Pippi fashion, but it&amp;rsquo;s also horribly imperialistic/racist. It&amp;rsquo;s still a fun book, but definitely a product of the times.</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woo! Big icy battles on land in and the sky/space around Hoth, training with a real (short) Jedi Master (and they&amp;rsquo;re all supposed to be dead), meetings between old friends&amp;ndash;who may not be too thrilled about losing in cards all those years ago&amp;ndash;another confrontation between Luke and Vadar, and the big bad reveal. Which&amp;hellip; seriously. His name is literally &lt;span class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;Dark Father&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that&amp;rsquo;s a truly bizarre adaptation of the Nutcracker. Or I suppose all of the other versions are bizarre, given that this is supposed to be as &amp;lsquo;close as possible&amp;rsquo; to the original Maurice Sendak version.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>There was a lot of potential in this episode, with two longer storylines&amp;ndash;one the continuation of the angels/devil storyline we&amp;rsquo;ve been dealing with for a while. But unfortunately, outside of a few very cool/trippy visuals it was a surprisingly quiet volume. A lot of human trouble, not enough supernatural craziness. Less moping at least, but without a real transition (at least in my opinion). Not terrible, but certainly one of the weaker entries in the series.</description>

      <description>Well that was delightful. One of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;m really glad for the 2021 Book Bingo. I don&amp;rsquo;t know when/if I would have found this book, if not for that, and I really quite enjoyed it. It&amp;rsquo;s got great steampunky worldbuilding (with some hints of body horror I honestly feel steampunk should probably have more of), royal/courtly intrigue, wonderful characters, and some delightful writing (with a French twist to the word choices that I don&amp;rsquo;t see much of).</description>
