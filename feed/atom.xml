<p>Disclaimer: When I first read Promise of Blood, I was reading it one chapter per day (discussing each over email as we went). Given the number of characters and initially disparate plot lines, this was probably not the best way to read this series. After reading the second two straight through in a single sitting or four, I actually went back and upped my rating for the first book. I almost want to go back and re-read it properly, but I doubt I'll do so.</p>
<p>Individual reviews (minor spoilers):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790883-promise-of-blood"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/powder-mage-trilogy/1-promise-of-blood.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure what to think about this book.</p>
<p>On one hand, there are several varied magic systems in this book. You have the Privileged, the Marked, and the Knacked.</p>
<p>The Marked, also known as Powder Mages, are what I would have thought of as the core of the book, with the ability to basically control gun powder in various ways and to snort it as a drug, increasing their physical abilities. Side note though: It's weird that they're interchangeably called Marked and Powder Mages throughout the book. It took me more than a while to realize those two were the same thing.</p>
<p>The Privileged are more traditional fireball, lightning bolt sort of mages and, honestly, are more interesting. Which, for a series named after the Powder Mages, is a bit weird.</p>
<p>The Knacked are a fairly unique idea in that their magic is basically limited use super powers--the ability to go without sleep, for example, or a perfect memory. It's a neat idea, but I think it would be even better if it were the only magic system in the world. On top of the other two, it just seems ... busy.</p>
<p>So far as the actual story goes, you kick off the book with a bloody revolution: overthrowing and killing the king, along with much of the court, and all of the Privileged in the city. That's certainly a powerful start, and the rest of the book deals with the aftermath of such an event. I wish it had been a bit more focused though. The book jumps from scene to scene and viewpoint to viewpoint, sometimes skipping days or more in between. It's jarring and sometimes hard to follow.</p>
<p>Mostly related, I wish that there was a little more depth to the characters. You basically had Tamas the Angry, Taniel the Druggie, Adamat the Investigator, and Ka-poel the Voodoo Sidekick. I do like Adamat at least. Maybe the entire book should have been from his point of view? (Side note: Having Tamas and Taniel, both Powder Mages, be father and son was confusing. Their names are too similar. I kept getting them confused.)</p>
<p>And then the ending. So many things all come to a head all at once... and then it's over. A single shot and then we're in the Epilogue. It was surprising to say the least. I guess the sequels will deal with the fallout of those last few chapters, but honestly I'm not sure if this book caught me enough to convince me to read the sequels.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17608111-the-crimson-campaign"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/powder-mage-trilogy/2-crimson-campaign.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I think the main reason that I had some problems following all of the different storylines in the first Powder Mage book was that I was reading one chapter per day and discussion as I went. Reading straight through the second book helped keep everything together. It also helps that there are few to no new major characters.</p>
<p>Overall, this was very much the second book in a trilogy. It picks up where the first left off and sets up the third. It probably wouldn't stand particularly well alone, but then again it doesn't have to. It's pretty much action all of the way through, tying up various plot lines just to ramp things up even more.</p>
<p>The general world building continues to feel something like a kitchen sink, with at least four different fairly vague magic systems all interacting in odd ways. Ka-poel is even more a singleton that everyone (even the 'gods') underestimates. I'm still not sure exactly what she did to Taniel (if it was in fact her), but I am curious how that particularly bit will end.</p>
<p>I think Taniel had the strongest story of the book, growing and changing the most of any of the characters. He's still insufferable at times, but he's also interesting. Adamat got pushed to the edge and breaks things (and people) to get his family back. It's obvious, but it's still a solid storyline (and I'm glad it ended up as relatively well as it has for him).  Tamas' storyline behind enemy lines was interesting enough, but I want to see him back with the others again.</p>
<p>And ... cliffhangers. I cannot stop now, which is of course the point. But now I'm actually looking forward to what's next.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20883847-the-autumn-republic"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/powder-mage-trilogy/3-autumn-republic.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>A solid conclusion. Basically, The Autumn Republic builds on the world of the first two books, without really needing to introduce much in the way of new characters (with a few relatively minor exceptions) or new world building, instead taking everything to a final conclusion.</p>
<p>So far as the characters go, I really found myself rooting for the good guys and hoping they would save the day, even when they did some not entirely unobjectionable things. In particular, I'm glad that Adamat's story at least didn't get any worse and that he managed to survive (spoilers) all the crap that the Marked and Privileged put him through.</p>
<p>So far as the world building goes, I still think that there were too many different magic systems floating around (especially when you take into account various power levels), but I think we finally got a bit more insight into some of the inner workings at least of the powder mages and Privileged which was nice. I'm vaguely annoyed that we didn't get any more about Ka-Poel or Nila, given that this is the last in the series. So it goes.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, worth the read. McClellan goes on my list of authors to watch.</p>
<p>Next up, I'm going to step away from my <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a> for a moment, since I have a book club meeting coming up and instead read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15819028-the-golem-and-the-jinni">The Golem and the Jinni</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6466778.Helene_Wecker">Helene Wecker</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7163862-zoo-city">Zoo City</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/426034.Lauren_Beukes">Lauren Beukes</a>.</p>
<p>After that, I should be back on track for my final (planned) series of the year: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40853-necroscope">Necroscope</a> (15 books!).</p>

<p>Animated GIFs are an amusing--if arguably useful--way of communicating. But hey, if something is worth doing, it's worth OVERDOING, no<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span>?</p>
<p>So I wrote a script to upload my entire collection of GIFs to a HipChat room<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></span>:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
import random
import re
import requests
import sys
import time

ACCESS_TOKEN = '{redacted}'
ROOM_ID = 8675309
GIF_PATH = '{redacted}'
TIMEOUT = 60

from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.image import MIMEImage
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer {}'.format(ACCESS_TOKEN),
    'Accept-Charset': 'UTF-8',
    'Content-Type': 'multipart/related',
}

url = 'https://api.hipchat.com/v2/room/{}/share/file'.format(ROOM_ID)

paths = [
    os.path.join(path, file)
    for path, dirs, files in os.walk(GIF_PATH)
    for file in files
    if file.endswith('.gif')
]
random.shuffle(paths)

for path in paths:
    print(path)

    raw_body = MIMEMultipart('related')
    with open(path, 'rb') as fin:
        img = MIMEImage(fin.read())
        img.add_header(
            'Content-Disposition',
            'attachment',
            name = 'file',
            filename = path.split('/')[-1]
        )
        raw_body.attach(img)

    raw_headers, body = raw_body.as_string().split('\n\n', 1)
    boundary = re.search('boundary="([^"]*)"', raw_headers).group(1)

    headers['Content-Type'] = 'multipart/related; boundary="{}"'.format(boundary)

    r = requests.post(url, data = body, headers = headers)
    time.sleep(TIMEOUT)</code></pre>
<p>The main reason that this script is at all interesting is that the API excepts (and requires) a <code>multipart/related</code> request, but the <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">Requests</a> won't send one. So instead we have to pull in Python's email libraries in order to generate the request body. It's a bit annoying, but an interesting dive into some of the more esoteric details of web requests.</p>
<p>Also, I've been on a kick of using slightly more complicated list comprehension:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>paths = [
    os.path.join(path, file)
    for path, dirs, files in os.walk(GIF_PATH)
    for file in files
    if file.endswith('.gif')
]</code></pre>
<p>Basically, if you put multiple <code>for</code> loops in a list comprehension body, it will return a single iterable, nested from the first to the last. So this is equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>paths = []
for path, dirs, files in os.walk(GIF_PATH):
    for file in files:
        if file.endswith('.gif'):
            os.path.join(path, file)</code></pre>
<p>It's arguable which is more Pythonic (probably the latter), but I do find it interesting what impact writing piles of functional code (<a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/programming/by-language/racket">Racket</a>) will do to code in other languages.</p>
<p>And, that's it. Short and sweet. Use responsibly.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Iterating the GitHub API (For users sans MFA)</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/01/iterating-the-github-api" /><id>urn:uuid:0bd52a91-eb2f-62af-b7a6-425164f823a7</id><updated>2015-12-01T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I found myself auditing an organization's users to see which have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multifactor_authentication">multifactor authentication</a> enabled<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>.

Since we have a not insignificant number of users, I wanted to write a quick script to automate it. Down the rabbit hole I go... and now I have a clean way of iterating across paginated GitHub API responses.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First, the full script:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import requests
import os

try:
    token = os.environ['GITHUB_TOKEN']
except:
    print('$GITHUB_TOKEN must be set with proper permission')
    sys.exit(0)

headers = {'Authorization': 'token {}'.format(token)}

def api_iterator(endpoint):
    url = 'https://api.github.com' + endpoint

    while True:
        response = requests.get(url, headers = headers)
        yield from response.json()

        if 'next' in response.links:
            url = response.links['next']['url']
        else:
            return</code></pre>
<p>The core of this script once again leans against the excellent <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">Requests</a> library for Python. It makes making simple requests and parsing the <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkHeader">HTTP Link Header</a> trivial. Also, <code>yield from</code> is pretty cool.</p>
<p>Basically, we use these instructions to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/">create a GitHub access token</a>. You'll need at least the organization rights, I don't have an exact list. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like there is a way to do this with a username, password, and MFA token. I tried a few variations but it kept claiming that I wasn't an owner of the organization. So it goes.</p>
<p>Now, if we wanted to use this for my original goal of finding users without MFA, you need the <code>/orgs/:organization/members</code> endpoint, with a specific filter:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>endpoint = '/orgs/{}/members?filter=2fa_disabled'.format(organization)
for user in api_iterator(endpoint):
    print(user['login'])</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can use it just as easily to get all of your repositories (similar to what I did for my post on <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/08/backing-up-github-repositories">backing up GitHub repositories</a>):</p>
<pre class="python"><code>for repo in api_iterator('/user/repos'):
    print(repo['url'])</code></pre>
<p>Cool. Hope it's helpful!</p>

<p>Individual reviews (minor spoilers):</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/910863.Spin"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/29/spin-saga/1-spin.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>(minor spoilers; although nothing more than used to be on the Goodreads summary)</p>
<p>I really enjoy science fiction where they take a really big / weird idea and just run with it. Spin is exactly that sort of book. In a nutshell, one night all of the stars seem to go out. Over the book, the protagonists discover that not the stars didn't actually go out, but rather the Earth was enveloped in a shell that is causing time on Earth to run roughly 100 million times slower, while at the same time preventing any ill effects therefrom.</p>
<p>It's a really cool idea and lets the author really jump through time in a way that not many novels can successfully pull off. On the level of the characters, we follow the main characters from the time the stars go out when they are children through the rest of their lives, jumping sometimes decades at a time (roughly in two different timeslines: one starting at age 10 and jumping forward, the other staying relatively constant towards the end of the timeline). On the scale of the rest of the universe, our sun grows old and warms the rest of the solar system, the stars all move about, and our galaxy even collides with another.</p>
<p>There is an interesting mix of high level science fiction on how the world changes as an impact of the Spin (the name of the shell enclosing the Earth for reasons that I never quite caught) with the low level lives of the characters. I didn't particularly like any of the characters, which is unfortunate, but having them ground the story was I still think a good choice.</p>
<p>Overall, solid big-idea science fiction. Well worth the read.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116410.Axis"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/29/spin-saga/2-axis.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of the other reviewers here are on point. In Spin, we followed the lives of a small groups of characters while <i>big ideas</i> happened around them, spanning either decades or billions of years, depending on your perspective. In Axis, the ideas are not nearly as big, the timespan isn't quite so vast, and the cast of characters has changed to ones I don't find myself caring about as much.</p>
<p>There is a bit of an interesting follow up here to the last chapter of Spin: what's on the other side of the arch and just what <i>are</i> the Hypotheticals. I think the first could make an interesting story all of itself, just following a series of explorers further and further through the worlds, but that's not what Axis is. And so far as the second--we don't really learn anything new. There are hints of something bigger (which is saying something, given something on a scale with the entire galaxy) and a few smaller neat ideas, but nothing quite comes together.</p>
<p>All together, I think one can either read just Spin or read the entire series (since from what I've read, Vortex is more of a sequel to Axis than either was directly to Spin). Looks like we'll give Vortex a chance.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9359796-vortex"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/29/spin-saga/3-vortex.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>After the strong opening in Spin and the someone meh followup with Axis, I wasn't expecting particularly much from Vortex. Consider me pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>Getting back to the huge events and big timespans of Spin, Vortex takes place ten thousand years after Axis, after the Temporal Arch discovered towards the end of that book ends its next cycle. Two of Axis' main characters (Turn and Isaac) are dumped out / recreated and picked up by a island sized ship that has been floating through arch after arch through the Eight Worlds (apparently the arches connecting Earth to Equatoria connect through several other worlds and finally end at Mars, which is a neat concept).</p>
<p>The far future society is interesting, as is the ruined Earth (global warming is bad). In the far future, societies seem to resolve around linked communities, either linking the thoughts of emotions of a community. The island they end up on is one of the latter, which has both its strengths but also a fair number of complexities, both of which I thought Vortex did an interesting job of exploring.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is actually a second story line interwoven into Vortex, revealing the ten thousand year future as a story written by a possible mental health patient. Honestly, I'm not sure why this storyline is here; I thought those parts weren't nearly as interesting (we've already seen that part of the timeline after the Spin) and could have been left out. They did set up an interesting possibility for the very conclusion, but that could have done without as well.</p>
<p>We also do learn more about the Hypotheticals (not so hypothetical any more...), which remains a neat concept, even if one that doesn't always make terribly much sense (how do they communicate?).</p>
<p>Overall, my previous point from Axis remains: If you read Axis, read all three. Vortex is a solid conclusion and an interesting book on its own merits. If you're more pressed for time, you can read only Spin and be well off.</p>

<p>That puts me at 89 for the year, slightly behind where I should be. Trying to read a book every 3.65 days on top of <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/05/nanowrimo-2015">writing a novel</a> is... fun. Onwards though!</p>
<p>Next up, I'm going to finish the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/99602-powder-mage">Powder Mage Trilogy</a>. The first book wasn't the best I've ever read, but it was good enough to give the other two a chance. Plus, I'm hoping for a few more answers. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Peninsula Drive</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/25/peninsula-drive" /><id>urn:uuid:1034e93a-2856-7a4e-d991-07c831d4ed71</id><updated>2015-11-25T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another drive, this time mostly up and down the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>I hit it more days than not, although I had a few days where I wrote little or even (twice) nothing. I had two great days, one of which was today, which pushed me over 50k. I'm also nowhere near the end of this book (I wouldn't be surprised if I cut close to half of what I've written thus far).

<p>Individual reviews (warning: there are spoilers in the latter reviews for the earlier books):</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2429135.The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/10/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/1-with-the-dragon-tattoo.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>It's not that often any more that I finish a book in a day. That should tell you something about what I thought about the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Especially when it isn't fantasy. It isn't science fiction. It isn't horror (at least not the supernatural sort). Really, it's more of a investigation / thriller. Not a genre that I read that often.</p>
<p>Honestly, for the first half of the book, I wasn't sure that I was even going to finish it, let alone read the sequels. There were a few different story lines going on that I didn't really see how they fit together. Nothing overly much seemed to be happening. Then, around halfway through (when the main characters finally started to interact more), things really started moving. I read the rest of the book in one sitting.</p>
<p>It's certainly disturbing at times. It reminds me of Koontz style thrillers  (who's books I like, so that is a good thing) in shining a light into the darker corners of humanity--albeit without the supernatural angle Koontz usually has.</p>
<p>Then there's the rape scenes (Yes, that's probably a spoiler. But given the content, the fact that they're fairly well known, and that they don't end up having <i>that</i> large of an impact on the plot...).</p>
<p>They certainly bring another level of depth and pack a punch, but honestly I think the novel would be just as strong without them. There is plenty of other characterization for the characters involved and as mentioned, they don't seem to advance the plot. Honestly, I felt like they were included for the sake of including them, which is never particularly great writing, let alone for a rape scene.</p>
<p>That being said, it's an intense book. The second half drives to a powerful conclusion and there's a twist or two that I only saw coming in hindsight. I'm honestly surprised, but I'll definitely be moving on to the sequels.</p>
<p>Side note: There are points that you can tell this book was originally written in a different language. Some of the phrasing is odd along with parts of the setting (although that could have been done even in an English language novel). I don't think it detracted from the work, but it's something to keep in mind.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5060378-the-girl-who-played-with-fire"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/10/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/2-played-with-fire.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo took a while to get into. It wasn't until Lisbeth and Blomkvist were finally in the same place perhaps halfway through the book that things really started moving.</p>
<p>The Girl Who Played with Fire is much the same.</p>
<p>Honestly, if I were to rate the first half of the book, I would give it three stars, maybe even two. There are just a lot of details that I just don't particularly care about. It's only halfway through, when Lisbeth stands accused of murder and various investigations are spinning once again out of control that the book starts getting good.</p>
<p>The second half? Five stars. I read it in one sitting. Things just keep getting more and more screwed up, with corruption and terrible people all over this place. I'll say that for Larsson. He can write terrible people.</p>
<p>One weird thing throughout is that there is entirely too much detail about mundane things. On several occasions you get essentially a stream of thought for everything that a character is doing... when they're really not doing anything interesting. Shopping, for example.</p>
<p>All together though, it's a strong book. Lisbeth has been through hell and emerged with a powerful combination of strength and brokenness. There are terrible people in the world, but they can be beaten. It's definitely the second of a trilogy, given that ending, and now I have to finish that. Hopefully, it doesn't take so long to speed up...</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6892870-the-girl-who-kicked-the-hornet-s-nest"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/10/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/3-kicked-the-hornets-nest.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Given that Hornet's Nest kicks off immediately following the events of Played with Fire, I was hoping that it could keep up the momentum of the previous book and avoid the slow first half / crazy second half that the previous two books had suffered from. Unfortunately, no such luck. If anything, it takes even longer to get moving and the conclusion isn't quite as action packed as the previous novels.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I do feel like this was a solid conclusion to the series. It wrapped up a lot of loose ends that I hadn't even realized I was missing and finished character arcs, particularly for Lisbeth. She's still odd, but I'm really starting to understand where she comes from. And in the end, she wins. I would have been rather grumpy with the author (even if he is dead) had she not come out all right in the end.</p>
<p>One bit that I thought was odd was the subplot about Erika Berger changing jobs and being stalked. Just like the rape in the first book (which did turn out to have a much larger impact on the latter two books), I don't feel like it adds particularly much to the story. It does fit the theme about systematic corruption and victimization of women, but I feel like the story would have been just as strong without it.</p>
<p>As I've mentioned before, I don't read particularly much that's this close to the real world, but I did enjoy all three books in this series. Even though I would consider it the weakest of the three; if you've read the first two, you should read this one as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, it's hard to say that I actually 'liked' the books. They're certainly well written, although you can tell at times that they were written in Swedish and translated. But the subject matter is rough to read about, especially given that it's entirely possible for such things to be happening in the here and now. I do recommend at least the first though. It's something that people should read, if just for another perspective on life.</p>
<p>On another note, it's a little strange to know that you are reading a series published posthumously. I'm not sure if it actually would have changed how I read the stories or how I think about them had the author still been alive, but it is still something to think about.</p>
<p>Next up, back to science fiction: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/910863.Spin">Spin</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/27276.Robert_Charles_Wilson">Robert Charles Wilson</a>. The premise is that one night the stars went out and now time on the Earth is running roughly 100 million times slower than the rest of the universe. It's a really neat idea; I hope the execution is as good.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>NaNoWriMo 2015</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/05/nanowrimo-2015" /><id>urn:uuid:1cebb79e-a448-08da-2796-1af10dc2c2cf</id><updated>2015-11-05T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2014/11/04/nanowrimo-2014">Last year</a> I had a two week old; this year, I have a one year old.

<p>And now pictures, because pictures are awesome!</p>
<p>First, you cut up the pumpkins and scoop out the guts:</p>

<p>My daughter is helping. She decorated hers:</p>

<p>Next, you cook them for a while (see above). The nice bit is that once you've cooked them, the skin comes right off. That is glorious, since it's so much easier to peel than with a knife.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/02/mostly-homemade-pumpkin-pie/3-peel.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/11/02/mostly-homemade-pumpkin-pie/3-peel.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>See, the skin just comes right off:</p>

<p>Next, mix everything except the spices into the pumpkin puree:</p>

<p>And now mix in the spices. The spices really make the pie:</p>

<p>Then... bake! It's odd that it's at two different temperatures, but so it goes:</p>

<p>Mmm, top with homemade whipped cream and nom away.</p>
