It worked much better in Volume 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Same team, same smaller stakes. Not going to lose states (again), but plenty of lives are on the line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s interesting seeing the team dynamics (on again, off again, half a dozen times in a single volume…).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The art for this one got weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ultimates name still doesn’t really work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it’s weird that the Kate Bishop story line almost 100% got dropped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward to the end.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lock In</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/lock-in/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/lock-in/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Making people change because you can’t deal with who they are isn’t how it’s supposed to be done. What needs to be done is for people to pull their heads out of their asses. You say ‘cure.’ I hear ‘you’re not human enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Been a bit since I last read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/08/23/old-mans-war/">any Scalzi&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;m glad to get back around to it though. Lock In is very good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, Lock In takes place in a near future Earth where a flu-like pandemic (Haden&amp;rsquo;s Syndrome) has caused &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/locked-in%20syndrome">locked-in syndrome&lt;/a> in some small percent of the world&amp;rsquo;s population (a small percent of billions is still an awful lot of people). Those affected are completely paralyzed, unable to move, while still being fully aware and conscious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily(ish) a massive global effort has figured out how to embed computer hardware in their brains so as to allow them to remotely pilot either robotic bodies (threeps&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>) or (more rarely) other humans who&amp;rsquo;ve allowed them access&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This of course is widely accepted by the rest of humanity and causes no issues whatsoever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>😄&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ink Exchange</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/ink-exchange/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/ink-exchange/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Getting ink felt right, like it would help her put her life in order, to move forwards. It was her body, despite the things that&amp;rsquo;d been done to it, and she wanted to claim it, to own it, to prove that to herself. She knew it wasn&amp;rsquo;t magic, but the idea of writing her own identity felt like the closest she could get to reclaiming her life. Sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s power in the act; sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s strength in words. She wanted to find an image that represented those things she was feeling, to etch it on her skin as tangible proof of her decision to change.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s not what I expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s definitely a sequel to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/wicked-lovely/">Wicked Lovely&lt;/a>. In that it&amp;rsquo;s in the same world with many of the same characters and takes place after the events of the first book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; fine? It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, if a bit jarring, to see more of the world and a broader cast of characters. But the plot is ugly, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to root for anyone really, and I missed the continuity you get from sticking with a united point of view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: trigger warning for rape. Off screen, but it&amp;rsquo;s a major plot point of the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll probably try one more in the series, since it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to go back to Ash. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh that was delightful. How did I not watch this sooner?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell: it&amp;rsquo;s a standard &amp;ldquo;save Christmas&amp;rdquo; plotline gone so &lt;em>very &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> alien. With Mantis and Drax having the main plotline to bring Peter Quill that one perfect gift is so fun. They&amp;rsquo;re just alien enough to bring more than a touch of chaos with them to Earth while at the same time human enough to relate to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, don&amp;rsquo;t expect anything deeper than the above. There really isn&amp;rsquo;t anything here you&amp;rsquo;d miss by not watching&amp;ndash;but on the other other hand it&amp;rsquo;s a quick watch and fun enough to be worth it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>All-New Ultimates, Volume 1: Power for Power</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/22/all-new-ultimates-volume-1-power-for-power/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/22/all-new-ultimates-volume-1-power-for-power/</guid><description>So, a new team. It’s… certainly not the Ultimates, despite the name. More of a Spidey and Friends.
But you know? It works.
It’s a lot more local level, where Spider-Man really shines. It’s fun seeing Bombshell grown up a bit. Cloak and Dagger are great. Yay Jessica Drew.
And yay ish Kitty Pride? She’s been there since just about the beginning. Pretty crazy to think.
Anyways. I enjoyed it.</description></item><item><title>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/21/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/21/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania/</guid><description>&lt;p>Upside: It&amp;rsquo;s visually super colorful and weird and it&amp;rsquo;s got a lot of potential for the new MCU Phase 5!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Downside: It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; weird and chaotic and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really fit with anything else we particularly know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; fine? I enjoyed watching it, but it&amp;rsquo;s in the category of MCU films that I doubt I&amp;rsquo;d watch again unless I&amp;rsquo;m doing a full rewatch (which is getting to be quite the endeavor).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man, Vol. 2: Revelations</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/21/miles-morales-ultimate-spider-man-vol.-2-revelations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/21/miles-morales-ultimate-spider-man-vol.-2-revelations/</guid><description>&lt;p>Resolution of the Parker storyline: check.

&lt;p>Miles’ father back and a bit of backstory? Awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kate Bishop’s secret? Also a nice* twist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>*not actually nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Goblin? Electro? Sabertooth? Hydra? Doom? Defeated!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a jam packed volume, just at the right scale for Spider-Man. A good one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man, Vol. 1: Revival</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/20/miles-morales-ultimate-spider-man-vol.-1-revival/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/20/miles-morales-ultimate-spider-man-vol.-1-revival/</guid><description>&lt;p>So… Peter Parker is back?

&lt;p>Haven’t you ever been in a fairy tale before?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s one of those books that just &lt;em>feels&lt;/em> like a fairy tale. An ageless story. A story passed down from long ago ages of myth and fantasy. Ages with heroes and villains and wizards and&amp;ndash;you guessed it&amp;ndash;unicorns.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate FF: Strangest Ever</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/17/ultimate-ff-strangest-ever/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/17/ultimate-ff-strangest-ever/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fantastic Four?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nah, Future Foundation!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a really weird story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Random incursions from random dimensions. Animal people. Cyclops super heroes. Atlanteans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And oy talk about tonal whiplash. Death and doom to animal people to kidnapping to quippy one liners to rape. All over the place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally, the art. It starts off, a bit unfinished… but I kind of like it. But then it gets even more unfinished and cartoony. Not a fan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a vaguely interesting story wrapped up in a lot of weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not surprised this is all it got.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>StackLang Part VI: Some Examples</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/16/stacklang-part-vi-some-examples/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/16/stacklang-part-vi-some-examples/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve gone through all sorts of things building up the StackLang language so far:

Figured it was probably about time. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, take the modern world and turn a number of interesting trends up to 11. Dissolve family ties. Genetically engineer children as a sort of uber-caste system. Make sex purely recreational. Add to that the perspective of &amp;rsquo;the Savage&amp;rsquo;. One raised on a reservation without this &amp;lsquo;modern&amp;rsquo; world&amp;ndash;giving an outsider&amp;rsquo;s perspective to all the changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the craziest thing is that this book was written in 1932&amp;hellip; Oddly prescient that. It could extrapolate from today&amp;rsquo;s world about as easily as the world of almost a century ago. Probably a bit more influence from the Internet and social media; perhaps more commentary on how the sexual revolution in Brave New World compares to what actually happened in the decades after the book&amp;rsquo;s release. But I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what else I&amp;rsquo;d see changed. A mark of good distopian sci-fi, that. For better or for worse.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/cataclysm-the-ultimates-last-stand/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/cataclysm-the-ultimates-last-stand/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another giant story; the second &amp;lsquo;biggest&amp;rsquo; of the Ultimate Marvel Universe&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/cataclysm-textbundle-bf6180.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Uh oh. Gah Lak Tus? Time to meet GALACTUS!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m sure this will go well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being titled Cataclysm—and the last in the Ultimate Marvel Universe line—after all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The X-Men’s involvement? Meh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spider-Man? Pretty awesome. Touching and personal, even in the face of a giant purple guy with a fancy hat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ultimates: what is with that art style? Everyone getting infected with Galactus is amusing. Purple Hulk!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ultimates Last Stand? The meat of the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reed Richard&amp;rsquo;s redemption arc (of a sort)? What&amp;hellip; he does not deserve that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s kind of a deus ex solution to an impossible problem. But that’s sort of the way with comics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/cataclysm-textbundle-97dfbe.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or … maybe it is?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Age of Ultron: The Complete Event</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/age-of-ultron-the-complete-event/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/age-of-ultron-the-complete-event/</guid><description>&lt;p>So this was on the list of &amp;lsquo;Ultimate Marvel reading order&amp;rsquo;, primarily as a lead in to the events of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/cataclysm-the-ultimates-last-stand/">Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand&lt;/a>. That was not necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel like most of these &amp;lsquo;big events&amp;rsquo; have ended up being overwhelming. They just need more room to breathe than comics can give them. The &amp;lsquo;smaller&amp;rsquo; scale comics (like Spider-Man) do so much better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/age-of-ultron-textbundle-f8d500.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit weird to be suddenly dropped into another universe with no idea what’s going on with all the characters I either know from the MCU or Ultimate line. But here we go!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/age-of-ultron-textbundle-7edd25.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yup. Definitely not in (Ultimate) Kansas any more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Crazy concept. Wonky time travel shenanigans. A decent solution. And yet another something happening after.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward to Cataclysm!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Spider-Man by Brian Michael Bendis, Volume 5</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/ultimate-comics-spider-man-by-brian-michael-bendis-volume-5/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/15/ultimate-comics-spider-man-by-brian-michael-bendis-volume-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>One Year Later.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Jean has never been the most stable personality, at last not in the Ultimate Universe. And… I get it. So much power, so young. And yet… she keeps causing more issues again and again. Oy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It all seems so sudden to escalate. And then in the way of comics—so suddenly over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and apparently the Sentient Seed dies again? Not sure what the point of that was either way.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There are three conditions you must agree to meet before I grant you this opportunity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Firstly, the considerable skill you possess must be used only for good. You will not let bitterness or anger draw you down the darker ways of your craft.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Secondly, if anyone asks for your help, you will give it willingly. I do not mean solely those who come to you for assistance with their ailments, but anyone at all who seeks your aid.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“And thirdly?” It occurred to me that I could be as good a liar as anyone. What was to stop me from agreeing now, and once I was out of here, doing whatever I pleased? I might yet live beyond dawn and see Mathuin brought down before nightfall. My heart began to race.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Thirdly, you will not seek vengeance. You will remain in Dalriada and stay away from Mathuin of Laois.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Take a bit of magic/folklore in an oldentimes Ireland; add in a Fae bargain (with all the complications that ensues); combine with a prince and princess who&amp;rsquo;ve never met outside of letters&amp;ndash;and seem entirely different in person; and finish it all off with fairy tale magic of Dreamer&amp;rsquo;s Pool.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wicked Lovely</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/wicked-lovely/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 17:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/wicked-lovely/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s YA Urban Fantasy.

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not the best Urban Fantasy I&amp;rsquo;ve read, but it&amp;rsquo;s really not bad. The world-alongside-our-world of the Fae is fairly standard, the romance is mostly predictable, and there are few enough action scenes.

&lt;p>Turns out, pretending the Sentient Seed died out lasted… not at all. Now there’s a new Mutant homeland in America…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-x-men-wood-2-textbundle-475838.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s actually really cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course Tian isn’t thrilled by the competition. It’s kind of amazing that after so long, Jean is still around. This has potential… but she’s starting with lies. I’m sure it will go well. Especially if she’s both hiding and going by her original name. Wat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it’s a neat story. If I didn’t know the Ultimate line was nearly over, I’d be intrigued. So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Downton Abbey: Season 4</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/downton-abbey-season-4/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 23:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/downton-abbey-season-4/</guid><description>Oy. After all the death and craziness of Season 3 (especially that finale&amp;hellip;), the family is all off kilter now. It takes a bit to settle, and then of course we&amp;rsquo;re on for all the more trouble.
Highlights:
Rose brings a touch of chaos Sybil never could. I&amp;rsquo;m glad they didn&amp;rsquo;t clone her. Rose is fun.
Man, Anna and Bates just don&amp;rsquo;t get an easy life, do they&amp;hellip;
Tom is in such a weird situation&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m liking his role as a sort of inbetween, of both worlds and neither.</description></item><item><title>House of Suns</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/house-of-suns/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/house-of-suns/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Everything came and went, everything was new and bright with promise once and old and worn out later, and everything left a small, diminishing stain on eternity, a mark that time would eventually erase.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>House of Suns is what really great sci-fi tries to be: it takes some fascinating ideas (generally technological), sprinkles in interesting characters (although some authors seem to find that optional), and goes from there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hercules</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/hercules/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/08/hercules/</guid><description>&lt;p>I somehow managed to never watch Hercules growing up.

&lt;p>Jimmy gets a hidden message in that hidden message with his father.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enough to reveal a tiny bit of Wolverine’s past, how Jimmy came to be (almost graphically), and who his mother/family is…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why does everyone have to be related?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a one off, meh. In the greater storyline, too late.&lt;/p>

Another Volume 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It could have been an interesting story. The Mutant Cure. The last 20 or so mutants (in the US/public). Divisions even among them. A Mutant Seed that can cure world hunger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it’s all moving so fast I barely even have a chance to get to know anyone we didn’t already know. And those left feel different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this has been the start of Ultimate X-Men, opening with Ultimatum? That would have been cool. As it is? Meh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost to the end.

It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;ndash;only sort of an MCU special; focused on the monster/&amp;lsquo;horror&amp;rsquo; side of Marvel comics rather than the super-hero business. They do open with a sillouette of the heroes we know and love&amp;hellip; before all color drains out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What comes next? An introduction to a monster hunting family/society and a competition to win the mysterious &amp;lsquo;Bloodstone&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;which gives you a sort of power over/against monsters. And then&amp;ndash;the HUNT/BATTLE ROYALE!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wakanda Forever</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/wakanda-forever/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/wakanda-forever/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How?&lt;br>
How is never as important as why.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So. How do you fill the giant Chadwick Boseman shaped hole in the MCU?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently&amp;hellip; with funeral services, Atlantis (but not), mer-Hermes (the first self described mutant in the MCU), and&amp;ndash;eventually&amp;ndash;someone new to take up the mantle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; fine?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were certainly some pretty spectacular action scenes. The under water scenes are pretty&amp;ndash;even if they only sort of make sense. The character and costume design continues to impress. And there are giant piles of funeral services and mourning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, the sudden introduction of an entire (large) underwater civilization feels&amp;hellip; weird. And as we&amp;rsquo;ve had before with the Marvel movies, some of the big battle set pieces don&amp;rsquo;t make that much sense. They&amp;rsquo;re going out on a boat to fight water people. All to&amp;hellip; limit how many fighters they have to film? And then all but like ten people die and we&amp;rsquo;re just okay with that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s about the middle of the road so far as Marvel movies go for me. Pretty good, decent action, but there have been better entries. Pretty high up for 2023, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably more because I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen that many movies this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Ultimates by Sam Humphries, Vol. 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/ultimate-comics-ultimates-by-sam-humphries-vol.-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/01/ultimate-comics-ultimates-by-sam-humphries-vol.-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>President Cap. Hydra. Fury doing Fury things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s certainly a jam packed volume… but for all that happens, what has actually changed?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feels like they’re trying to reboot a reboot while holding together entirely too much damage they (the writers) have done to this version of the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall: it’s fine, but I’m not surprised that this line doesn’t last long. Being yet another Volume 1 doesn’t help. Onward!&lt;/p>

Not sure how much else there is to say.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I so remember the old Winnie the Pooh &amp;amp; Christmas Too (from 1991). Man the nostalgia when the bugs (and their Napoleabug leader) sound the charge. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know when I would have watched it, but I remember that part!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s cute. The kids enjoyed it.

&lt;p>Now we have TWO Spider-Men.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s another part of what became Into the Spider-Verse, with another Peter Parker getting shot across dimensions and meeting Miles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s good fun all around. I’m glad to see the two get a chance to meet. And I’m going to have to check out some main universe Spider-Man at some point!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well that escalated again’ly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given the number of sudden super powered threats, it’s not over surprising. But in a world reeling… I’m doubtful we’ll get the gravitas this deserves.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A direct sequel to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/09/lost-souls/">Lost Souls&lt;/a>, we finish up with Victor (etc) and his nanomachine replacements out in Montana.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of cool seeing the rugged, individual, hyper-&amp;ldquo;American&amp;rdquo; characters fight back. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit much at times, but I enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a conclusion to even two books, let alone five&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s fine? It does tie up most of the threats. But on the other hand, it&amp;rsquo;s all build up and &amp;hellip; just ends. I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of that. And barely any of the monsters/big bads from the first three books come back&amp;hellip; Just Erika and Jocko. Of all the things to keep&amp;hellip; why Jocko?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth finishing once I&amp;rsquo;d come that far, but it really is the sort of series you could probably finish at the first book and not miss mutch.&lt;/p>

Norse mythology is &lt;em>absolutely&lt;/em> no exception to that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this story, we have a novelization of the story of Angrboda. Wife of Loki. Mother of monsters. She&amp;rsquo;s been around a while (it&amp;rsquo;s mythology, even she doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how long) and she just wants to be left alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like seeing a slightly more &amp;lsquo;raw&amp;rsquo; Norse mythology, especially than you get from (for example) the Marvel universe(s).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a bonkers story. You never know what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen. Being built on myths, the world is flexible at best. Rules are made to be broken. And that&amp;rsquo;s before you have gods et al with the ability to rewrite reality / see the future / move from world to world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed it. Worth a read.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Old enemies are &lt;strong>thrilled&lt;/strong> to have Spider-Man back. Wisecracks and all.&lt;/p>

So mutants? Not in a great place after Magneto’s wave.
The ones that are left are on the run and there are more than a few factions teeing to hunt them down.
And as if that weren’t enough, add in the new forces in SEAR. And others.

&lt;p>Because there’s a new* villain in town.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I did not realize that he originally came from the Ultimates universe. So this is actually a new origin story!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pretty cool. It’s interesting seeing what made it into Into the Spider-Verse—and what didn’t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do wish we’d had a chance to see Peter and Miles interact more, but I think this will work out. It’s got a lot of potential.&lt;/p>

If you visit a world where another you is still alive, you die.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why have I survived? Because I am a creature more devious than all the other mes put together. Because I saw myself bleeding out and instead of checking for a pulse, I began collecting her things. I survive the desert like a coyote survives, like all tricksters do.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating premise, especially when you dig just a bit deeper: Who are the people most likely able to jump? Who&amp;rsquo;s the most likely to have died on other worlds?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a story about privilege. About a world built for the rich and powerful&amp;ndash;by those who have nothing or less; those that pay everything and get nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Cara is stuck right in the middle of it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Short Return West</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/17/a-short-return-west/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 17:15:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/17/a-short-return-west/</guid><description>&lt;p>Had the chance to return to the Bay Area for a week for work.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Laura: You are dying. You want to die.&lt;br>
Logan: How do you know?&lt;br>
Laura: Charles told me.&lt;br>
Logan: What else did he tell you?&lt;br>
Laura: To not let you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a gritty, brutal sort of R rating that really lets you see the darker side of what a world with superpowers could be&amp;ndash;without the twisted sort of humor that Deadpool has to take the edge off. The action is quick. It&amp;rsquo;s bloody. And they &amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t hold back. It&amp;rsquo;s not the sort of superhero movie that you may always want to see, but I think that it&amp;rsquo;s one worth watching. At least once.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Cartographers</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/16/the-cartographers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/16/the-cartographers/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Cartography, at its heart, was about defining one&amp;rsquo;s place in the world by creating charts and measurements. Nell had lived her life by that idea, that everything could be mapped according to references and thereby understood. But she could see now that she had been paying attention to the wrong references.&lt;br>
It was not a map alone that made a place real.&lt;br>
It was the people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a tricky one to review. It&amp;rsquo;ll take some minor spoilers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell (if you want to completely avoid spoilers), it&amp;rsquo;s a decent book with a fascinating premise that could have done so much more for the actual execution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Return to Alcatraz</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/15/return-to-alcatraz/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2023 17:15:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/06/15/return-to-alcatraz/</guid><description>&lt;p>A &amp;rsquo;team building&amp;rsquo; exercise with a twist.&lt;/p>
