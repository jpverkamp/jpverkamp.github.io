&lt;p>Morpheus: [Morpheus addresses the people of Zion] Zion, hear me! It is true, what many of you have heard. The machines have gathered an army and as I speak, that army is drawing nearer to our home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[the Zion crowd becomes louder]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Morpheus: Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us. But if we are to be prepared for it, we must first shed our fear of it. I stand here, before you now, truthfully unafraid. Why? Because I believe something you do not? No, I stand here without fear because I remember. I remember that I am here not because of the path that lies before me but because of the path that lies behind me. I remember that for 100 years we have fought these machines. I remember that for 100 years they have sent their armies to destroy us, and after a century of war I remember that which matters most&amp;hellip; We are still here! Today, let us send a message to that army. Tonight, let us shake this cave. Tonight, let us tremble these halls of earth, steel, and stone, let us be heard from red core to black sky. Tonight, let us make them remember, THIS IS ZION AND WE ARE NOT AFRAID!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>More Matrix! I love it!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Toy Story 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/11/toy-story-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/11/toy-story-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>For me, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/02/toy-story/">Toy Story&lt;/a> falls at just the right time for a blast of nostalgia. It came out when I was a kid and I watched it over and over again. Somehow, Toy Story 2, despite only coming out 4 years later, just doesn&amp;rsquo;t hit the same mark. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, it&amp;rsquo;s still a good fun movie and worth watching, but&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s just not quite as good.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Buzz Lightyear: Woody, stop this nonsense and let&amp;rsquo;s go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Woody: Nah, Buzz.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sigh]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Woody: I can&amp;rsquo;t go. I can&amp;rsquo;t abandon these guys. They &lt;em>need&lt;/em> me to get into this museum. Without me, they&amp;rsquo;ll go back into storage. Maybe forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buzz Lightyear: Woody, you&amp;rsquo;re not a collector&amp;rsquo;s item, you&amp;rsquo;re a child&amp;rsquo;s plaything. You - are - a &lt;em>toy&lt;/em>!&lt;/p>

This movie came out at just the perfect time for me&amp;ndash;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t into the counter culture as much, but even then I was messing around with computers and hacking&amp;ndash;and I absolutely love every minute of it.

There&amp;rsquo;s not much you need to know between the two, so you can read them in either order and if it were up to me, I&amp;rsquo;d probably swap them (mostly because I want to know what happens next!), but it still works.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ratatouille</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/04/ratatouille/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/04/ratatouille/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s just a delightful movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Start with &amp;ldquo;Anyone can cook&amp;rdquo;, turn that up to 11 by making &amp;lsquo;anyone&amp;rsquo; a rat (because rats don&amp;rsquo;t belong in kitchens, get it?) and end up with a surprisingly touching movie about believing in yourself, doing whatever you set your mind to, and not having to necessarily do what it is that others expect of you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/03/pirates-of-the-caribbean-on-stranger-tides/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/03/pirates-of-the-caribbean-on-stranger-tides/</guid><description>&lt;p>Pirates of the Caribbean&amp;hellip; without Bloom or Knightly?

I read it outloud, part of a chapter a night many nights, and it still took a few months. Glad I did it though, it&amp;rsquo;s a great book, especially for kids, but even more so to read aloud with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a story about a group of children, each lost and/or alone in different ways, each brilliant (as the first section and a series of tests shows both to them and to us) and thus necessary for a &lt;em>SECRET MISSION&lt;/em>. I won&amp;rsquo;t go much more into that, but once they get out on the mission and have to prove that they are more than up to the task&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Blade Itself</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/31/the-blade-itself/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/31/the-blade-itself/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Every man has his excuses, and the more vile the man becomes, the more touching the story has to be. What is my story now, I wonder?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Joe Abercrombie / The Blade Itself have long held a highly recommended spot on my to read lis, so when I caught the audiobook on Libby/the Indiana Digital Library&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> I figured it was about time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quick version: it&amp;rsquo;s wonderful, but also &lt;em>very&lt;/em> dark. One of the main characters is a barbarian who&amp;rsquo;s family was recently killed, another is a soldier crippled in war turned torturer. And somehow, Abercrombie actually really makes you feel for the both of them, but man it takes a bit&amp;hellip; On top of that, there&amp;rsquo;s some fascinating hints of magic&amp;ndash;plus some more overt examples, no less terrible, when we meet Bayaz&amp;ndash;the First of the Magi&amp;hellip; or is he?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Another Turkey Run</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/30/another-turkey-run/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 10:56:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/30/another-turkey-run/</guid><description> View on Flickr</description></item><item><title>Altered Carbon: Season 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/29/altered-carbon-season-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/29/altered-carbon-season-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s a huge bummer.

&lt;p>So that was what had happened before the survey. Now we’re here, ready for the next major disaster. (Spoiler warning.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a full length Murderbot novel! Yay! And it gets far deeper and weirder into corners of the worldbuilding we&amp;rsquo;ve only had hints of before. I love seeing the hints of tension with the corporations and how much control they hvaqe, the weirdness that is alien remnants, and the knowledge that there are super weird problems out there that aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily directly related to Murderbot.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/29/pirates-of-the-caribbean-at-worlds-end/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/29/pirates-of-the-caribbean-at-worlds-end/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is so much to love about this movie.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The games reminded me of something the author Haruki Murakami says in the intro to the English edition of Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman: “I find writing novels a challenge, writing short stories a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure.” In video games, we don’t have corresponding terms for novels and short stories—we simply have large games and small games. These Game Maker games were Murakami’s gardens: vibrant, intimate, and full of charm. Having just planted a large forest with Alec, I was eager to find my own little patch of fertile soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I absolutely love Spelunky. I remember playing the (now) Classic version when that&amp;rsquo;s all there was (even going so far as to decompile and mess with the source code, yay GameMaker Studio), spending hours on the HD remake (beat Olmec, made it to Hell, never did beat Yama)&amp;ndash;mostly on Steam, and more recently put just as many hours into Spelunky 2. It&amp;rsquo;s a great game and what little I knew of the story was already inspirational. So when I saw this book, written by Derek Yu himself, of course I had to give it a try.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spring Mill Camping</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/27/spring-mill-camping/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 17:55:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/27/spring-mill-camping/</guid><description> View on Flickr</description></item><item><title>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/14/pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-mans-chest/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/14/pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-mans-chest/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl/">Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&lt;/a> was surprisingly good. So of course they&amp;rsquo;re going to make a sequel and turn everything up to 11. More Johnny Depp (yay)! More love triangles (boo)! More supernatural beasties (awesome)! More mythology (sweet)!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the plus side, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to like. As mentioned Depp is still great. That&amp;rsquo;s probably the number one reasons these movies are as awesome as they are. He just nails the roll.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exit Strategy</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/09/exit-strategy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/09/exit-strategy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Murderbot has really stirred up some trouble. Now Dr. Mesnah&amp;rsquo;s caught up in it and it&amp;rsquo;s time to come back and perhaps fix some things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like the rest, it&amp;rsquo;s a quick read with a wonderful sense of all too familiar alienness, wonderful hacking and action scenes, and a fascinating look at what it means to be a person&amp;ndash;or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth the read, but at this point, I expect you&amp;rsquo;ll already be blowing through these.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Redwall: The Graphic Novel</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/09/redwall-the-graphic-novel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/09/redwall-the-graphic-novel/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s a great story. I read it long ago and &lt;a href="&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/06/19/redwall/">Redwall&lt;/a>">listened to it a couple years ago&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s a great story of animals basically doing the human thing in and around an abbey run by mice. It&amp;rsquo;s great fun so long as you don&amp;rsquo;t think too long and hard about which animals are sentient and which aren&amp;rsquo;t and how the vast differences in scale and lack of opposable thumbs could possibly work&amp;hellip; but other than that, it&amp;rsquo;s great fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Formatwise, I&amp;rsquo;ve read a few graphic novel adaptations of novels and usually they feel a little lackluster (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/white-sand/">White Sand&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/05/08/storm-front-graphic-novel/">Storm Front (Graphic Novel&lt;/a>) as two examples), but if anything was going to work, this was it. It&amp;rsquo;s already a lighter fantasy world with lots of light riddles and actions and over the top characters that fit just fine with graphic novels. And it pays off. As an introduction to this world, it&amp;rsquo;s a great alternative. It&amp;rsquo;s just so fun to see pictures of how someone else saw all of the characters from this world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well worth the read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>V for Vendetta</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/09/v-for-vendetta/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/09/v-for-vendetta/</guid><description>&lt;p>That’s quite a story; quite a world. I only vaguely remember the film, but I still hear Hugo Weaving’s voice as V and Natalie Portman as Evey. The bones of what I remember match though. A story of a world gone well over the edge and a man determined to bring it back—but at what cost?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fascinating read and worth the time. I need to watch the movie now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pocahontas</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/07/pocahontas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/07/pocahontas/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of my favorites of the Disney animated classics. It&amp;rsquo;s a straight forward enough story that at least takes some pains to show the terrible way that European settlers treated Native Americans and shows that people are people and will often try to do the right thing, given a chance. The music is wonderful and the animation is really quite something that up even today.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moon Knight</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/moon-knight/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/moon-knight/</guid><description>&lt;p>That &amp;hellip; was truly bizarre. A main character with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dissociative%20identity%20disorder">dissociative identity disorder&lt;/a> where their powers deal with but &lt;em>are not&lt;/em> caused by their disorder is fascinating (and truly weird to be watching at the same time as &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/01/altered-carbon-season-1/">Altered Carbon: Season 1&lt;/a>&amp;hellip;), the Egyptian background and characters are great, and there&amp;rsquo;s are some pretty awesome scenes, fight and otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Castingwise, Oscar Isaac is awesome. I&amp;rsquo;m amazed at how he brings both Marc and Steven to life. Ethan Hawke is a great maybe-baddie-but-maybe-just-a-different-point-of-view. And May Calamawy as Layla El-Faouly is a real stand out in just about everyway. I hope that we get to see more of them in the greater MCU, although I have no idea how that&amp;rsquo;s going to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking of which, this was so different from other MCU properties. It&amp;rsquo;s got Egyptian gods and powers more or less walking around, which fits, but I do really wander how/if we&amp;rsquo;d see them or their avatars square off against normal MCU level heroes. Tonally, it&amp;rsquo;s rather different too. There&amp;rsquo;s still an end of the world threat, but a lot of it&amp;rsquo;s dealing with the internal struggles of Steven/Marc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s probably my favorite of the MCU TV shows so far&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll have to rewatch it and see if it holds up. It&amp;rsquo;s really quite good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it began.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is just such a fun movie. Johnny Depp is absolutely the star of the show:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mullroy: What&amp;rsquo;s your purpose in Port Royal, Mr. Smith?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Murtogg: Yeah, and no lies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jack Sparrow: Well, then, I confess, it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Murtogg: I said no lies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mullroy: I think he&amp;rsquo;s telling the truth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Murtogg: If he were telling the truth, he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have told us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jack Sparrow: Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t believe the truth even if he told it to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The sheer number of wonderfully quoteable lines he has:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Norrington: No additional shot nor powder, a compass that doesn&amp;rsquo;t point north,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[looks at Jack&amp;rsquo;s sword]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Norrington: And I half expected it to be made of wood. You are without doubt the worst pirate I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jack Sparrow: But you have heard of me.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s on top of crazy pirate action (with a heart of gold buried somewhere deep in there), Geoffrey Rush&amp;rsquo;s spectacular portrayal of Barbossa, Bloom&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;everyman with a mysterious history&amp;rsquo;, and Keira Knightley&amp;rsquo;s beginning to work against the sexism inherent in the age and region (although that gets better in the sequels).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/stiff-the-curious-lives-of-human-cadavers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/06/stiff-the-curious-lives-of-human-cadavers/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Death. It doesn’t have to be boring.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s quite a book. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to try out one of Mary Roach&amp;rsquo;s books for a while and this one came up on the (digital) library, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a try. In a nutshell, it goes into the process of what happens right up to and after you die (including brain death and organ donation) along with the various things that might be done with your body afterwards (such as medical training and testing various products along with alternatives to burial).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“What I do is, I think of them as wax.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Theresa is practicing a time-honored coping method: objectification. For those who must deal with human corpses regularly, it is easier (and, I suppose, more accurate) to think of them as objects, not people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating look into things you just don&amp;rsquo;t often think of. I quite enjoyed it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Altered Carbon: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/01/altered-carbon-season-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/05/01/altered-carbon-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>That is a spectacular show. In a nutshell, it takes a cyberpunk future world where the technology exists to separate the &amp;lsquo;mind&amp;rsquo;/stack/DHF of a person from their body/sleeve. Really, it&amp;rsquo;s primarily a tool for the wealthy to accumulate even more wealth and a number of the characters mention that we aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to live forever&amp;hellip; And that actually made me think. It&amp;rsquo;s been something I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought would be neat: to be able to repair or move into another body if this is damaged, to send me mind to other worlds, etc. But how in the world would people react to that sort of power and change?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the very least, let&amp;rsquo;s hope it&amp;rsquo;s better than what we see in Altered Carbon. Hoo boy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, it&amp;rsquo;s part detective show that segues into murder/revenge/revolution plots with more than a dash of questions around identity in a world where bodies are quite literally and easily (if not cheaply) replaceable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of rather graphic violence and nudity, but for the most part it makes sense within the context of the show. Certainly not one for the kids though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The casting, I loved. Joel Kinnaman as Takeshi Kovacs nails the &amp;lsquo;Envoy brought back&amp;rsquo;, Dichen Lachman as Reileen Kawahara is a wonderful &lt;span class="spoiler">example of long lives corrupting people&lt;/span>
. My surprise favorite? Chris Conner as &amp;lsquo;Poe&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;the AI running an Edgar Allen Poe themed hotel that hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen a guest in years/decades. He&amp;rsquo;s such a surprisingly wonderful character.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s quite a spectacular show. Well worth the watch. Now the confusing it&amp;hellip; &lt;span class="spoiler">apparently almost the entire cast was replaced for S2?&lt;/span>
It&amp;rsquo;s something that the concept of the show certainly allows, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know how in the world they&amp;rsquo;re going to pull that one off. I guess we&amp;rsquo;ll see!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eric Carle's Animals Animals</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/29/eric-carles-animals-animals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/29/eric-carles-animals-animals/</guid><description>That&amp;rsquo;s an adorable and longer than expected book of poetry about animals in various ways and forms in prime Eric Carle form.

&lt;p>“Amias Mitchell,’ Kip said. ‘Born aboard the Asteria. Forty Solar days of age as of GC standard day 211/310. He is now, and always, a member of our Fleet. By our laws, he is assured shelter and passage here. If we have food, he will eat. If we have air, he will breathe. If we have fuel, he will fly. He is son to all grown, brother to all still growing. We will care for him, protect him, guide him. We welcome you, Amias, to the decks of the Asteria, and to the journey we take together.’ He spoke the final words now, and the room joined him. ‘From the ground, we stand. From our ships, we live.

Turns out: also really good. While they changed a few things with the details of how the keys worked that are probably more efficient to do in TV (not opening the tops of people&amp;rsquo;s heads for instance), it&amp;rsquo;s still got the same wonderfully creepy dark magical vibe. I do love the actors&amp;ndash;Bode in particular does his part very well, as do his siblings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man that&amp;rsquo;s a crazy show. Well worth the show (warning, it is dark, although not overly graphic).

What&amp;rsquo;s there even to say? It&amp;rsquo;s a story about a son and a father. About growing up Jewish during the rise of the Nazi party and during the Holocaust. About the ways that dramatically changes the lives of even those survive.
All told in a comic book style with different style animals for different races.
It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating way to tell the story (a (Jewish) mouse wearing a (Polish) pig mask to hide from the Nazis&amp;hellip;) even if / perhaps because it raises questions of it&amp;rsquo;s own.</description></item><item><title>Rogue Protocol</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/17/rogue-protocol/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 00:00:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/17/rogue-protocol/</guid><description>(There needs to be an error code that means “I received your request but decided to ignore you.”)

Curse of the Constantines: it’s about blood and family and the nephew never mentioned. I like the idea of sometimes blood matters—and sometimes it doesn’t. Death and Cigarettes—a send off, Constantine style. He never really dies. Seems weird to have Epiphany and Finn here. Bad Blood… what was that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, out in Constantine style, could have done without Bad Blood. So it goes.

&lt;p>El is a super dramatic senior&amp;ndash;and she&amp;rsquo;s got her reasons, with the whole potential Dark Goddess thing she has going on&amp;ndash;and life is only getting weirder. She&amp;rsquo;s determined to get &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em> out, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the least bit of sense and she&amp;rsquo;s absolutely going to do it in world ending style. Oh, and of course there&amp;rsquo;s Orion. What&amp;rsquo;s up with that relationship, am I right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, if you loved &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/13/a-deadly-education/">A Deadly Education&lt;/a> (as I did), you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to love The Last Graduate. It turns the whole Scholomance craziness up to 11, gives us a dark chosen one that actually kind of works within the world building, and I really do love and care for the characters. And if the cliff hanger at the end of book 1 wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough&amp;hellip; THERE&amp;rsquo;S AN EVEN WORSE ONE AND THE NEXT BOOK ISN&amp;rsquo;T EVEN OUT YET.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When constructs were first developed, they were originally supposed to have a pre-sentient level of intelligence, like the dumber variety of bot. But you can’t put something as dumb as a hauler bot in charge of security for anything without spending even more money for expensive company-employed human supervisors. So they made us smarter. The anxiety and depression were side effects.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Murderbot is out on their own!

&lt;p>This is an exercise in fictional science, or science fiction, if you like that better. Not for amusement: science fiction in the service of science. Or just science, if you agree that fiction is part of it, always was, and always will be as long as our brains are only minuscule fragments of the universe, much too small to hold all the facts of the world but not too idle to speculate about them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What am I in for…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it’s an interesting read. In a nutshell, it builds up a model for ‘vehicles’ that start with a single wheel and basic sensor and grows, adding better senses and in particular a more and more complicated brain. I would have liked something a bit more technical and/or practical but there are a lot of interesting ideas here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One downside, the wording is … a bit pretentious at times. Academic is probably a better word. Above is the first paragraph.. and that’s really how it stays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, an interesting enough and surprisingly quick read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Deadly Education</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/13/a-deadly-education/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/13/a-deadly-education/</guid><description>Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s a joy of a book. Saying which I suppose&amp;ndash;after you&amp;rsquo;ve read it&amp;ndash;feels a bit ironic.
It&amp;rsquo;s one part magic school, with your more or less typical teenage protagonists doing more or less typical teenage thing. In my opinion, Novik does this very well. Main character El (short for Galadriel) is so wonderfully snarky and done with it teenage girl that I could practically feel her angst coming off the page&amp;ndash;and it&amp;rsquo;s all the better, because she really does have a good reason for it.</description></item><item><title>Paradise Lost</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/12/paradise-lost/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/12/paradise-lost/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s an odd sort of book. It&amp;rsquo;s basically the story of the Fall of Satan plus Genesis, wrapped up in some crazy flowery poetry, writ long. It&amp;rsquo;s been on my &amp;lsquo;why not&amp;rsquo; list for a long time and hearing more about it in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/07/daemon-voices/">Daemon Voices&lt;/a> bumped it up a fair bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Am I glad to have read it? Yes. Is it a good book? Maybe. The poetry is absolutely beautiful in some places, but the story is one you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard before, if you&amp;rsquo;ve any sort of judeo-christian upbringing, although it does embelish in spots. And oy does it get long. It thought there were 7 books for some reason, so when I finished number 7 and we&amp;rsquo;re barely into Genesis&amp;hellip;, well, I knew I was wrong about that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, the first few books with the fall of Satan are very cool and I&amp;rsquo;d say worth reading. The rest, hit or miss.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 23: No Future</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/11/hellblazer-vol.-23-no-future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/11/hellblazer-vol.-23-no-future/</guid><description>&lt;p>An interesting collection.

&lt;p>Life is terrifying. None of us have a rule book. None of us know what we&amp;rsquo;re doing here. So, the easiest way to stare reality in the face and not utterly lose your shit is to believe that you have control over it. If you believe you have control, then you believe you&amp;rsquo;re at the top. And if you&amp;rsquo;re at the top, then people who aren&amp;rsquo;t like you&amp;hellip; well, they&amp;rsquo;ve got to be somewhere lower, right? Every species does this. Does it again and again and again. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if they do it to themselves, or another species, or someone they created.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh. Wow. &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/31/the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet/">The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet&lt;/a> felt like lightning in a bottle. Something amazing&amp;ndash;a look at the life in a long haul spaceship full of strange and wonderful characters&amp;ndash;that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how it could possibly be continued.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out&amp;hellip; just like this. This is a very very good sequel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, A Closed and Common Orbit was a bit of a surprise. We only barely get any of the characters we know and love from the first book. There are a few hints of and references to them, but for the most part, we instead focus on Lovey/Sidra* and Pepper, learning once again how two very strange and different sorts of people can grow into a family. The same general idea, approached a totally different way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>All Systems Red</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/08/all-systems-red/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/08/all-systems-red/</guid><description>&lt;p>Okay, I get what all the hype is about.

&lt;p>I COULD HAVE BECOME a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.

There&amp;rsquo;s not particularly a huge over-arching plot. Instead, our intrepid band of oddballs is off on a long mission (it&amp;rsquo;s a Long Way after all) to the edge (center?) of &amp;lsquo;known&amp;rsquo; space. Really, we&amp;rsquo;re just on a trip with them, through all the ups and downs, the drama and relationships. It&amp;rsquo;s exactly the sort of story I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know I was looking for. Well worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
