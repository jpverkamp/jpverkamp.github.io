<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13642710-nexus"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/05/07/nexus/1-nexus.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>It's been a while since I've read near future science fiction that wasn't overly apocalyptic. This was a good re-introduction thereto.</p>
<p>Basically, we're a few decades in the future. Genemods and other biotechnology are known and not entirely uncommon. I'm not sure such technology will actually be available in only 25 years, but it would be interesting to live in a world where such things have come to be.</p>
<p>The technology at the core of the story is Nexus: a nanotech drug that allows brain to brain communication. Even further, the main character has figured out how to run an OS on it. You're basically installing a new OS and code directly on your brain. That sounds at once really cool and terrifying to me. Especially since I do believe that this is in our future, whether or not it comes about via something like Nexus. It's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I found the characters in general interesting. Seeing Kaden Lane's thought process as he came up against radically different government philosophies and ended up in situations well out of his depth was interesting. <spoiler>Su-Yong Shu as an early posthuman seemed at once just human and alien enough to be believable.</spoiler></p>
<p>As both a positive and negative, there are a lot of frantic action scenes, particularly in the latter half of the book. They're well written and driving but got right on the edge of action fatigue by the end.</p>
<p>Overall, great book. Among the best cyberpunkish / near future sci fi I've ever read. Big world building cliff hanger right at the end. Definitely going to read the sequel(s).</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15997527-crux"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/05/07/nexus/2-crux.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Crux basically picks up where Nexus let off.</p>
<p>Nexus is a force in the world, with more than a million people using it, growing every day. One particularly interesting use is giving Nexus to children with autism to allow them to communicate directly mind to mind. Another is the children that were born to parents using Nexus. Interesting in both cases.</p>
<p>On the negative side, there have already been cases of people using Nexus for more nefarious purposes. Rape. Blackmail. Assassination. Like any new technology, there is the potential for much to go wrong. Something this big? Of course it does.</p>
<p>But where it really starts getting terrifying is when you consider the parallels with what Snowden revealed a few years ago and the current election cycle. The United States government (among others) in the world of Nexus has made such transhuman technology a crime. They are detaining those same children born with Nexus. One of the main storylines of Crux is just how deep such a hidden agenda might go. It's well written.</p>
<p>One note from a structural standpoint is that there is quite a lot of action in this book. It gets to the point where the action itself starts to drag. It could really use a few more breathers. It's certainly not a dealbreaker, but I think Nexus did it better.</p>
<p>All together, an excellent book. I look forward to the conclusion.</p>
<p>Final note: Feng is my favorite. He's hilarious.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20424928-apex"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/05/07/nexus/3-apex.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>A solid conclusion to the Nexus trilogy. Some things go exactly as I expected them to, but there are still a fair few surprises thrown in for good measure. For the most part, a lot of loose ends are tied up, making it a good way to end a series.</p>
<p>The stakes go up with most of the world in turmoil, the US and China in particular. The Chinese part was interesting (particularly since I've spent some time studying how the Chinese censorship systems work in the modern day), but felt tonally rather different from the previous books. It vaguely fits, but it felt almost like half a sequel and half something entirely new.</p>
<p>Speaking of a different focus, this book does turn a bit of the focus away from Nexus towards the post-human thoughts. Shu in particular. That particular storyline had already come about in the second book, but it really comes to the fore here. Again, it feels like the general story was drifting a bit, even if the drifting was interesting.</p>
<p>Overall, I think this Apex is weaker than Nexus and about as strong as the middle book. Apex is crazy huge and drags at time, but by this point I've invested enough time that I really want to see it through. I'm glad I did.</p>
<p>Random side note: The blurb says "<i>They call them the Apex - humanity's replacement.</i>". Did they actually mention this term at all in this book? I don't remember that overmuch.</p>
<hr />
<p>Solid sci fi. Next up I have a nice standalone novel<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson">Brandon Sanderson's</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1268479.Warbreaker">Warbreaker</a>. It'll be interesting reading this intermixed with listening to Sanderson's Mistborn. So far, I think they're different enough that it shouldn't be a problem. We'll see.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Dresden Files</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files" /><id>urn:uuid:ce4ed653-cd1f-0850-d9af-8a6143fa7b7f</id><updated>2016-04-22T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47212.Storm_Front"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/1-storm-front.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91477.Fool_Moon"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/2-fool-moon.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91476.Grave_Peril"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/3-grave-peril.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91478.Summer_Knight"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/4-summer-knight.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91479.Death_Masks"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/5-death-masks.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99383.Blood_Rites"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/6-blood-rites.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17683.Dead_Beat"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/7-dead-beat.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91474.Proven_Guilty"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/8-proven-guilty.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91475.White_Night"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/9-white-night.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/927979.Small_Favor"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/10-small-favor.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3475161-turn-coat"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/11-turn-coat.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6585201-changes"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/12-changes.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8058301-ghost-story"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/13-ghost-story.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12216302-cold-days"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/14-cold-days.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19486421-skin-game"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/15-skin-game.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Well. That's a lot of books.</p>
<p>I've read the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40346-the-dresden-files">Dresden Files</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10746.Jim_Butcher">Jim Butcher</a> a half dozen times already. Always room for once more!</p>
<p>More specifically this time around, I've been looking for audio books I can listen to while either commuting to and from work or during the slower times of work itself. The Dresden Files has the advantage there in that I've already read them so many times I can miss small sections without actually losing much in terms of overall plot. It also has the advantage of being narrated by the excellent <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/169487.James_Marsters">James Marsters</a>. Well worth it.</p>
<p>My thoughts on my n+1'th time through the series? Just as good as before. The first books are rough, but they just keep getting better. It's by a fair margin my favorite urban fantasy series. I'd probably go so far as to say my favorite series, full stop.</p>
<p>Individual reviews follow. There are a few spoilers for individual books and even more in later books for the earlier ones. You have been warned. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47212.Storm_Front"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/1-storm-front.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>And so it begins.</p>
<p>I've probably read this series roughly half a dozen times. This time I'm listening to them on audiobook. It certainly goes by quick.</p>
<p>Storm Front has a direct and mostly guessable plot, mixed in with hints at a much larger world to come. Although the story is straight forward, that doesn't mean it's boring. In fact, it helps to keep driving the story on page after page (minute after minute)?</p>
<p>The magic system isn't particularly well defined yet, which I'm not sure what I think about. I like magic systems with rules, even if I don't know them and I'm not sure that this world fits that. There are hints of a much much larger world to come though, so that's cool.</p>
<p>Characterwise, Dresden is a 'good guy' to a fault. Despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that he seems himself as an old-fashioned kind of chivalrous, he tends towards the sexist. I'd forgotten how blatant that is, especially in the early books. Part of it, I think is that we're entirely in Dresden's headspace and he still has a lot of growing up to do.</p>
<p>I know a fair few people that won't read the Dresden Files because of this. To each their own.</p>
<p>Other than that, Muphy has potential as a tough cop, but she isn't quite there yet. Macrone has the core of a 'mob boss who cares'. The bad guy(s) are fairly one dimensional, although there are hints of something more beyond them even this early.</p>
<p>Overall, Storm Front is the first book in a series and not nearly as strong as some of the later entries in the series, but it's a good start.</p>
<p>Onwards!</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91477.Fool_Moon"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/2-fool-moon.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Two down.</p>
<p>This time around, we're dealing with werewolves. And not just stereotypical werewolves, but a small pile of different forms. People that turn into wolves, people turned into wolves against their will, magic item based wolves... It's a lot. It's getting close (if not outright blowing past) the 'kitchen sink' world building that's rather common in urban fantasy. On the other hand, it's neat to see a few different takes on werewolves.</p>
<p>Another neat beat of world building comes in the form of Chauncy, a civilized (seeming) demon with a British accent who apparently knows far more about the larger world and Dresden's part in it than anyone else we've seen. It'll be interesting to see how/if that comes back in the future.</p>
<p>After that, we get a bit of growth for Dresden. Although he certainly respects some women's abilities (Murphy for example), he'll turn right on and go on about wanting to protect them. There's also the sexual descriptions of just about every single female character we meet (with several of them ending up naked at various times, because werewolf).</p>
<p>As a counterpart, the only male character that we get described is Marcone, who always has eyes like dollar bills. This is mentioned oddly often. He's still one of my favorite characters in the series. We know that he's not a 'good' man by just about anyone's definition, but at the same time, he does have his own code that he will stick to. He could be a very powerful enemy--or ally.</p>
<p>Plotwise, there are a few more twists this time, partially coming from the number of different parties involved and partially because we're tied to Dresden's (flawed) point of view. It's a nice change from Storm Front.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a stronger story than Storm Front and an excellent sequel.</p>
<p>Onwards!</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91476.Grave_Peril"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/3-grave-peril.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>First there was a sorcerer. Then werewolves. Next up, ghosts and vampires. The Dresden Files certainly get around.</p>
<p>I already said it last time, but it applies again: Grave Peril is a much better book (in my opinion) than Fool Moon, which in turn is much better than Storm Front. I'm sure this won't be the same pattern forever, but it's impressive enough to carry through three books.</p>
<p>Next thought: Michael. Dresden is what many boys / young men want to be. He's a powerful loner who's out to save the day (more or less). Slightly older and wiser though (for some definitions there of), I really admire Michael. He has a rock solid faith in God (granted, it's a different sort of faith when God is quite obviously a force in the world)--even when doubting himself. He <b>will</b> protect those that need protecting and he <b>will</b> do the right thing.</p>
<p>There are a few other very cool scenes in this book: A showdown in a cemetery (it was a dark and stormy night). A vampire-hosted masquerade. A trip through the Fae realm. Dresden's mind. Dresden really letting loose and blowing things up. I enjoy both the worldbuilding that underlies each of these scenes combined with the descriptions to make them come to life in my head.</p>
<p>Here, we also see the world expanding. There are at least three different kinds of vampires with all of the politics that entails. Dresden has dealings with a powerful Fae. There's a very cool scene with a dragon (with the oomph to casually smack Dresden across the room). This is part of what makes me keep reading these books. It's a huge world that somehow manages to avoid (for the most part) feeling 'kitchen sink'y' (although I'm still not sure how).</p>
<p>There's also more of the same when it comes to a surprising number of characters ending up naked or at least mostly so. Less than Fool Moon (I think), but still. Add to that the seductive powers of the White Court...</p>
<p>On the weirder end, this is the first introduction we get to Dresden's subconscious. I'm not really sure what to think about it. It feels like there's more to it than just a hallucination, but it's hard to tell for certain.</p>
<p>Overall, as I said, a great read.</p>
<p>Onward!</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91478.Summer_Knight"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/4-summer-knight.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Sorcerers, werewolves, vampires... And now the Fae. We already had hints of it from the previous books, particularly in the guise of Lea--Harry's literal Fairy Godmother.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a very cool bit of worldbuilding. The Fae aren't particularly uncommon in Urban Fantasy and I really like the Dresden Files version thereof. They've even gotten to the point where they act as background knowledge when reading other series. If something isn't mentioned, I'll fall back to the Dresden Files as ground truth. It's just that solid.</p>
<p>Another nice bit is to finally see the White Council that we've heard about for several books. They're more or less what I imagined they would be in this world. A whole pile of different people and cultures brought together by a shared magic. And just like any other large group of people, there is politics.</p>
<p>Of course Dresden ends up smack dab between the two.</p>
<p>The plot is neat, with a few twists and a good number of players muddying the waters. It's interesting to see how even beings as elemental and unchanging as Fae can be twisted against themselves.</p>
<p>Cool scenes:</p>
<p>Dresden and Murphy fighting a giant plant monster at a Home Depot equivalent.</p>
<p>Meeting the crazy powerful (crazy and powerful) Fairy Mothers, the eldest of the queens.</p>
<p>That final battle in the sky.</p>
<p>The scope of the world keeps growing, revealing more and more of the things that go bump in the night (and that could tear Dresden limb from limb without breaking a sweat).</p>
<p>Also, Dresden finally told Murphy just about everything. About freaking time.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91479.Death_Masks"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/5-death-masks.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Dang. New favorite Dresden File. More of Michael and the introduction of my favorite baddies in the Dresdenverse.</p>
<p>What really makes Death Masks shine is the the characters:</p>
<p>First: The Archive. That's just a very cool (yet sad) idea all at the same time. The idea that there could be a being with the sum total of all human knowledge ... and that it's a little girl? Dang. I want to know more. How did the first Archive come to be? What exactly capabilities does she have?</p>
<p>Next, two more Knights: an atheist and an accidental Baptist. Both are interesting characters, especially in contrast to the much more stereotypical Knight of God Michael. I like both how Butcher gave them different voices and how Marsters (in the audiobooks) brought those voices to life. There's also an interesting contrast near the end of the book between Dresden and the Knights. It turns out that Dresden is not a 'good' person, at least not in terms of how the Knights see good. After all, payphones cost more than a quarter now.  ..</p>
<p>Then there's the Denarians. Fallen angels bound to the thirty silver given to Judas Iscariot? Dang. They have literal millennia of experience to bring to bear along with a human host, making them yet another upping on the danger scale. We only really get personality from their leader Nicodemus, but man is he an excellent villain. I do wonder if he's supposed to be the same member of the Jewish ruling council mentioned in the Gospel of John. I don't think that's been confirmed either way...</p>
<p>Finally we learn a fair bit more about Marcone. He remains the epitome of Lawful Evil: He has a strong code of ethics for what he will and will not do, but at the same time that code doesn't always (often?) align with what is legally or generally considered moral. He's a fascinating individual that way and honestly a lot more similar to Dresden than I think either of them would care to admit.</p>
<p>One thing that we haven't seen before in this book is a relatively explicit sex scene between Dresden and Susan. It's a definite step away from the fade to black and hints of the previous books, but I don't think it was over done. The most amusing part about it: the original idea for how to do it safely came from Michael's 14 year old daughter. I'd missed that the first few times reading this book.</p>
<p>My favorite scene in the books though? Dresden creates a tracking spell using a plastic duck that walks towards whatever it is tracking. He then later uses said duck as a fake gun to threaten someone. I love it.</p>
<p>Finally: random quotes of awesomeness:</p>
<p>"Better safe than exsanguinated"</p>
<p>"Sod works in mysterious ways."</p>
<p>"My faith protects me. Kevlar helps."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99383.Blood_Rites"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/6-blood-rites.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I still like Death Masks better, but Blood Rites is still quite good. We're back to big magical rituals (a five book cycle?) but also a bit of goodly hint of vampiric mayhem (the Black and White Courts this time around).</p>
<p>Of course, since it's the White Court, the entire plot this time has to revolve around a ritual curse targetting an adult film director. All righty then.</p>
<p>As I'd mentioned before, the best part of Death Masks was the characters. This time around, it had to be have been just random scenes.</p>
<p>Awesome scenes:</p>
<p>A fight with monkey demons whose primary weapon is... flaming monkey poo. Dresden has a quite literal fight with a literal monkey on his back.</p>
<p>An entropy curse that kills via whatever bizarre means it can access. Including... death via frozen turkey.</p>
<p>A big basement showdown with Mavra (she's back!)... And that wasn't even the climax of the book.</p>
<p>A big fight in a cave system while a bad ass demon summoning is going on.</p>
<p>That's not to say that there weren't a few neat character moments. We learn a lot more about Thomas, Murphy, and Kincaid. Oh, and Dresden has a magic dog now.</p>
<p>One interesting thing that we really haven't seen <em>that</em> much of prior to this is lasting consequences, other than the war with the Red Court. Things are changing in the Dresdenverse. The big example: Dresden's hand. Smaller examples that I'm sure will mean more later: Dresden learns a lot more about his mother/family and about some of the more troublesome parts of the White Council (the Blackstaff). Slightly terrifying example: He Who Walks Behind.</p>
<p>My other favorite part of the Dresden Files in general and this book in particular:</p>
<p>"I put the ick in magic."</p>
<p>"I the hell am Harry."</p>
<p>"Proof is something you use with rational people. Right now you aren't."</p>
<p>Love it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17683.Dead_Beat"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/7-dead-beat.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Ooh fun. A big bad necromancer (in this world, the driving force behind World War I) got taken out by the White Council decades ago. Unfortunately, he left behind a small pile of minions, who of course came calling on Dresden's home turf.</p>
<p>This is right in the running with Death Masks for my favorite thus far. There's a reason it has the highest Goodreads ranking among the first ten Dresden books...</p>
<p>There are a whole pile of awesome baddies, united in their necromantic powers but each with their own twists. Butters gets a serious boost and a lot more importance. We see a bit more of Thomas and Dresden's growing relationship as brothers.</p>
<p>Another awesome part is the whole new twist to come about from Lasciel's coin from the ending of Death Masks. We saw it building a bit in the last book, but things are coming to a head hear. I'll just say that I missed the twist the first time around and it blew me away. On re-reads, I can see just how carefully the hints are planted. It's lovely.</p>
<p>But really? The thing that puts this book right up there with the best of them? The final battle scene. A one-man polka band powered Tyrannosaurus rex brought back on a stormy Halloween night for one last hunt through the streets of Chicago. So cool.</p>
<p>One interesting note that I hadn't noticed before, but there's a part around the middle of this book where Dresden talks with Morty. He drops a line about how Murphy's dad was good people... And then corrects that to <i>is</i> good people. Coming from an ectomancer, that's an interesting line. Each re-read is fascinating to see how Butcher weaves his world together, both planting seeds well in advance or re-using minor plot points in major ways. We'll just leave it at that.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91474.Proven_Guilty"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/8-proven-guilty.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Another very solid entry.</p>
<p>Basically, there's black magic afoot. Fear monsters from the Nevernever are attacking a horror movie convention and it's up to Dresden to find out why. Add to that complications with Michael's now almost adult daughter Molly. The interactions between Molly and Dresden are weird and uncomfortable at times, but on the other hand they seem for the most part disturbingly realistic.</p>
<p>I like a lot of the characterization here. We get more on the Carpenters, in particular Molly and Charity. I really love that entire family. Charity shines in this book in particular. We learn a bit more about why she dislikes Dresden so much and how much of a badass she is when the need is right. Molly is in and out of the spotlight quite a bit, but it's obvious she'll be central to future books.</p>
<p>We also get a bit of a hint about how other wizards bend the rules. It's heavily implied that the Gatekeeper has a warning from the future that he passed on to Dresden. It's not time travel strictly speaking... but still.</p>
<p>Then, there's the ending. While there is still a monster-of-the-book thing going on, we're really seeing more of the larger implication of the Dresdenverse. There are a few questions raised here (who is the person behind the person behind the curtain) which we don't even get an answer to... Yet. It's annoying in the first book or two of a series, but this many along, it's something that can really make a series.</p>
<p>Amusing aside: Thus far there are baddies with the same name as my wife and my daughter in this series. It's a bit jarring each time I come across them.</p>
<p>Fun quote of the day: "It is far easier to avoid inappropriate amorous desires if one runs screaming from the room every time a pretty girl comes in."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91475.White_Night"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/9-white-night.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I think this is one of the first of the Dresden Files books that really feels like a more traditional mystery. (Or at least my idea thereof; I don't read much traditional mystery).  Mysterious shadowy figures and murders abound and throughout it's unclear exactly who/what is responsible. There are a few clues for the reader that Dresden otherwise misses, but for the most part, we learn about happenings as they happen.</p>
<p>One really cool scene: Dresden takes advantage of the fact that you can draw energy from the surrounding environment in order to power a spell. He proceed to shoot off a pillar of fire 2-3 feet wide and 20 stories high into the night sky. Can you imagine being a mortal living in Chicago and seeing that? The best part: He didn't even need the fire. He just needed to freeze a chunk of Lake Michigan. Love it.</p>
<p>Another great part about this book in the continued characterization. We learn more about Mouse's magical nature (A real temple dog!). We get another cool scene of Marcone saving the day (he's really starting to make a habit about that). And we get a much better look at House Raith in general and Thomas in specific. For the most 'human' of the vampires, they're still kind of terrifying when they want to be.</p>
<p>So far as larger world building, the stage doesn't change overly much. There are more details about what exactly happened in Dresden's past with He Who Walks Behind.</p>
<p>Oh and that scene at the end with Lash. I really liked her. I liked seeing how Dresden dealt with the power he had and the power he could stand to gain. It was neat to see how just as she changed him, he changed her in turn. It will be interesting to see what fall out there will be from that (if any) in future books.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/927979.Small_Favor"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/10-small-favor.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Small Favor combines my favorite parts of the Dresden Files: the Denarians and Knights of the Cross, Marcone, and the Fae in varying degrees. On top of that, where White Night tended towards mystery, Small Favor is straight up actions. The story hits the ground running and never really stops, right through several big set piece battles and one of the bigger finales we've seen (albeit not quite up to the level of Sue...).</p>
<p>On top of that, we get another of Butcher's lovely twists which just drop the bottom out of a story. You think you know what's going on... turns out you've missed the same huge clue that Dresden has. I'm always impressed with those.</p>
<p>There was one particular interesting thought that stuck with me even after I finished the book. Neither the Knights nor the Denarians believed that it was possible Dresden could be rid of Lash without taking up the coin. Everyone has their blind spots. It makes you think about where your own blind spots might be. And back in the Dresdenverse, given how tightly tied the Dresden Files are to Dresden's point of view, what is <i>he</i> missing?</p>
<p>We're also starting to see more and more power creep. Dresden may have lost the ability to sling Hellfire with Lash's demise, but he's got a new trick up his sleeve curtesy of a new heavy hitter on the supernatural scene. If all of the big guns show up in the promised finale to the Dresden Files another ten books down the line... It's going to be an interesting day.</p>
<p>Fun quotes:</p>
<p>"We're ostriches and the whole world is sand."</p>
<p>"That's the problem with you immortal types. You wouldn't get a pop culture reference if it skittered up your neck and implanted an embryo down your esophagus."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3475161-turn-coat"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/11-turn-coat.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Morgan shows up on Dresden's doorstep and asks for his help. Things degrade pretty much exactly as you might expect from there.</p>
<p>We do get a third part in the trifeta of styles from the previous two books: mystery to action to political thriller. There is still plenty of the first two, but now we're dealing primarily with the fallout of a politically motivated murder.</p>
<p>Two things that we learn quite a bit more about in this book are the home of the White Council in (under) Edinburgh and more about that island in the middle of Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>For the former, it's interesting to get a bit more of an insight into just how powerful the senior council can be--while at the same time showing how they're all still human.</p>
<p>In the case of the latter, we get just about as many new questions as we get answers, with a number of characters surprised at just how crazy Dresden is and with hints coming from all over the place about how that island is more interesting/important than we know even now.</p>
<p>We also finally get the start of answers about the Black Council. We're still nowhere near to finding out who is in the core of that particular conspiracy, but it's starting to come to the fore. I do hope that it doesn't take until the planned series finales in a dozen books for more large parts to come out into the open...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6585201-changes"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/12-changes.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>In the first chapter of Changes, Dresden learns he has a daughter. Throughout the book, he loses everything (his car, his office, his home...). He makes deals he promised he would never make.</p>
<p>He takes on archangel-tier baddies--and wins. He takes on the Red Court and kills them all.</p>
<p>And in the last chapter, he's shot. Presumably fatally. (Although given that this is book 12 out of a planned more than 20...</p>
<p>I remember the first time I read this book. Ghost Story wasn't out yet. That was a long wait. Time time around, I can start immediately (and know what actually happened). That's doesn't make this stories impact and less.</p>
<p>Another thing that has changed since I last read Ghost Story? I have a daughter now. Younger than Maggie, but still. If I were in the same situation; if I had to make the choices Dresden made?</p>
<p>The best Dresden Files thus far, by a decent margin. Where can it even go from here?</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8058301-ghost-story"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/13-ghost-story.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>And then he was dead. Ish..</p>
<p>Of course the ending of Changes couldn't be the end of Dresden. And after Ghost Story, I think I can forgive Butcher for that cliff hanger. Mostly. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>
<p>Thematically, it's a different sort of story, with Dresden mostly without any of his usual tools of the trade and having to learn a whole new set of rules for how the rules work. After the crazy power spike he got throughout Changes, it's something that needed to happen and I think it was done well.</p>
<p>On top of that, we get all of the fall out. Turns out, when you operate on Dresden's scale and when you take out an entire race of bad guys, you create something of a massive void. And now his friends have to deal with it.</p>
<p>Among the developments of Ghost Story is bringing Mortimer Lindquist (it's funny because 'mort' or something similar means death in many Romance languages) to the forefront. Just trying to stay alive makes sense in the darkness that is the Dresdenverse and yet in the end, he still comes through for the good guys. He had a nice character arc, particularly for what was previously a minor, annoying character.</p>
<p>We also get a previous bad guy back again. No spoilers, but given the subject matter (dead things), it's guessable. It was nice to see the fallout of previous problems like that come up again. I have a feeling we'll be feeling that throughout the rest of the series.</p>
<p>All together, it wasn't my favorite book in the series--it's just too different. On the other hand, it's a good way to hit the reset button on a fair bit of power creep and shift the Dresden Files to a new normal. It'll be interesting to see where it goes next...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12216302-cold-days"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/14-cold-days.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Dresden is remarkably good at weaseling his way out of deals he should never have gotten himself into in the first place. This time around though? His number is up. He has to work for Mab.</p>
<p>Mab first job for her new Knight? Kill Maeve.</p>
<p>All righty then.</p>
<p>Crazy scene: Mab throws Dresden a birthday party. In a huge scale model of his old apartment, made of ice. One thing you can say for the Fae, when they go all in, they really go all in.</p>
<p>Crazy scene: Dresden floats a boat off the bottom of Lake Chicago by freezing a large chunk of ice. He comes out of it coated with frost. He's got some serious new oomph going on and it's kind of terrifying.</p>
<p>Crazy scene: Dresden learns about the 'gate' part of the Gatekeeper's job. He learns more about the outsiders than he ever wanted to know. He learns more about Winter's role in all this (and thus his own). He learns exactly what it means to have claimed Demonreach. He starts to learn about how it's all related. He starts to learn who the real enemy is... The Dresdenverse is getting bigger.</p>
<p>And then the ending. Well that was intense. We have new Summer and Winter Ladies. The latter of which is Molly...</p>
<p>The next few books are going to be even more interesting.</p>
<p>(I feel like I say that a lot with Dresden...)</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19486421-skin-game"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/15-skin-game.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>And then there was a heist.</p>
<p>Book 15, so the Denarians are due. In they came, and not in a way that anyone would have expected. Turns out, Mab owes Nicodemus a favor. She wants Dresden to carry it out.</p>
<p>What's the job? Oh, not that complicated. Steal the Holy Grail from Hades. Yes, that Hades.</p>
<p>Dresden is voluntold that he'll be working with Binder--who Dresden threatened to kill the next time he saw him; Hanna Ascher--a warlock with a serious gift for fire magic; Anna Valmont--who's team was previously killed by the people she's now working for; and Goodman Gray--a seriously creepy shapeshifter with a fascinating background and work ethic.</p>
<p>It's kind of awesome to get the handful of new characters along with fleshing out some old favorites. Combined with the twist in genre and we have a story that manages to at once grow the Dresdenverse yet more while at the same time pulling back the scope as a bit of a breather. Based on the ending, it's going to get interesting again.</p>
<p>On another cool side, we learn a bit more about Uriel and his archangelic powers and get a small chance to see Michael back in the action. Michael remains among my favorite characters in the books, so it's good that he yet has a part to play. Oh, and he has the power to destroy a galaxy. Just so you know that.</p>
<p>Random note: There's a kind of crazy explicit sex scene roughly half way through the book. It's a bit of a surprise, especially when you're listening to the book on a car ride with someone who's never listened to any of the other Dresden books before. So it goes.</p>
<p>Awesome scene: Butters goes full Jedi Knight. And then there was a Jewish Knight of the Cross. It's actually getting kind of ridiculous how only 1 of the 4 we've seen (2 of 5 if you count Murphy) has been particularly devout.</p>
<hr />
<p>So... that's a thing. I cannot wait for Peace Talks... But I guess I'll have to. Hey, if it takes long enough to come out, I might just read the entire series yet again before then. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>
<p>Up next on my audiobook lineup I'll be re-listening to the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40910-mistborn">Mistborn series</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson">Brandon Sanderson</a> in preparation for the two new ones that have just come out. I previously listened to The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10803121-the-alloy-of-law">Alloy of Law</a> (see my <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/31/2015-reading-list-retrospective">2015 Reading List Retrospective</a>), so I already know that they translate well to audio. I'm looking forward to it.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Ensuring docker-machine is running</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/19/ensuring-docker-machine-is-running" /><id>urn:uuid:0e62eb30-f56c-7441-a014-2f509ef5d9d5</id><updated>2016-04-19T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When developing using <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> on OS X, you'll currently<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span> have to use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/machine/">docker-machine</a> to spin up a virtual machine that is actually running the docker containers.

The above <code>eval</code> command took long enough to hit this limit.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So how do we fix it? Essentially (using <a href="http://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a>, my current shell of choice, although others should be similar):</p>
<pre class="zsh"><code>assert-docker() {
    command docker ps 2&gt; /dev/null &gt; /dev/null
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Starting docker..."
        docker-machine start default
        eval $(docker-machine env default)
        echo
    fi
}

docker () { assert-docker && command docker $@ }
docker-compose () { assert-docker && command docker-compose $@ }</code></pre>
<p>The basic idea is that <code>assert-docker</code> first checks if <code>docker</code> is running by trying to run <code>docker ps</code>. <code>$?</code> contains the status code, which will be non-zero if <code>docker ps</code> failed, so check that. If that's the case, assume <code>docker ps</code> failed because <code>docker-machine</code> wasn't running, so start it up. This will run <code>docker-machine start default</code> more often than needed, but it turns out it's a <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP">NOP</a></code> if it's already running.</p>
<p>The only interesting part here is the use of the keyword <code>command</code> that prefixes <code>docker</code> or <code>docker-machine</code> within the functions. Basically, this tells ZSH to use the system version of <code>docker</code> or <code>docker-compose</code> rather than the one that I defined, thus preventing an infinite loop. Whee!</p>
<p>How's it work?</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ docker ps

Starting docker...

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186074.The_Name_of_the_Wind"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/03/10/kingkiller-chronicle/1-name-of-the-wind.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I've heard rather good things about this book, so figured I had to read it.</p>
<p>On the good end, it's an interesting fantasy world with something of its own take on worldbuilding, magic, and critters (near enough to various sources, but it still fresh to me). I particularly like how magic works. There are parts of it which are well understood by those who study such things and work more or less like technology. Then there are the truly fantastical bits, used by few and understood by fewer--but still with a hint of structure under it. I like it.</p>
<p>Another positive was how the story kept pulling you along. I wanted to know more about how the world worked and how Kvothe would get himself out of whatever trouble he had gotten into next. I wanted to know how a particular story actually happened, before it changed hands a thousand times or more.</p>
<p>The negative half of that though? Cliffhangers. I swear half the chapters in this book ended in the middle of a thought, only to either be resolved at the very beginning of the next chapter or put off until after an interlude. So far as I'm concerned, it's a way to keep me reading, but an annoying one.</p>
<p>And then there's Kvothe. Sigh. He's too good at just about everything that he puts his mind to. Youngest to do this, best at that, perfect this, etc. Even if it gets him into trouble more often than not, it's still annoying to try to read about.</p>
<p>After that, there wasn't much depth to any of the other characters. I can only really tell apart two of the masters (Elodin and the one in charge of the Archives) and of his friends and acquaintances? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ D*nn* is supposed to be the best ever, but we never learn enough about her to care. Fela had hints of personality, but of course Kvothe doesn't care about that. Heck, Ambrose has the most personality of most of them and that's just to say he's anti-Kvothe.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the plot.</p>
<p>There wasn't one.</p>
<p>When things that could tangentially be described as plot finally started happening, I was surprised to find myself already 3/4 of the way through the book. And they never really went anywhere. I'm sure we'll eventually get some answers in a sequel... But if even a thousand page story cannot stand by itself...</p>
<p>All that said, I enjoyed it. I'll even read the sequel.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to get some answers... but I wouldn't bet on it.</p>

<p>And here I thought The Name of the Wind was a long book.</p>
<p>For the most part, everything that I wrote in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1411402558">my review of Name of the Wind</a> still holds true here. The worldbuilding is really cool (sygaldry in particular) and the writing itself just keeps pulling you along. I always wanted to know more.</p>
<p>On the other hand, The Wise Man's Fear is even worse about feeling like Rothfuss basically wrote several novels and basically stuck them together. You have Kvothe at the University, Kvothe and the Maer, Kvothe Hunts Bandits, Kvothe and the Fae, and Kvothe with the Adem. Each would have been a solid book by itself, and each actually has something of a traditional plot to it (with more solid conclusions than book as a whole had). But put them together and it just starts to feel like something of a slog.</p>
<p>I still don't overly care for Kvothe as a character. He's just too good at absolutely everything to be overly believable while at the same time being remarkably stupid a good part of the time. Each time he does something like that, I have to remind myself that he's only supposed to be a teenager and that actually makes sense... Which would be better if he acted like it the rest of the time. For a while there, I was hopeful that D*n* would realize she could do so much better... Alas.</p>
<p>So it goes.</p>
<p>I still enjoyed it and I'm still glad I read it. I've already started The Slow Regard of Silent Things and I'll certainly read Kingkiller #3 whenever it comes out.</p>

<p><strong>Author's Foreward</strong>:</p>
<p><em>You might not want to buy this book.</em> ...</p>
<p>Yeah... I thought we were going to get a little more insight into the world of the Kingkiller Chronicles. A little more about the University. A little more about Auri.</p>
<p>I guess one out of three ain't bad?</p>
<p>Basically, it's Auri being strange and re-arranging junk. Also there's a riveting scene of Auri making soap.</p>
<p>On the more positive side, there is some rather beautiful wordplay here. That's one thing that Rothfuss can do particularly well: wrote evocative descriptions.</p>
<p>Honestly, I found the Endnote the most interesting. A star just for that. It's always interesting to see into the mind of a writer. I didn't find the story itself <em>"disconcerting, off-putting, or confusing"</em> but rather odd and boring. So it goes. It <em>probably just wasn't for [me]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Author's Endnote</strong>:</p>
<p>... <em>If you're one of the peopel who found this story disconcerting, off-putting, or confusing, I apologize. The truth is, it probably just wasn't for you. The good news is that there are many other stories out there that are written for you. Stories that you will enjoy much more.</em></p>
<p><em>This story is for all the slightly broken people out there.</em></p>
<p><em>I am one of you. You are not alone. You are all beautiful to me.</em></p>

<p>Next up, I'm going to be reading the unpublished novel White Sands by Brandon Sanderson (if you want to read it, it never hurts to ask...<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>).

<p>On the downside, Staked has pretty much the same issues I've had with each of the previous novels. I don't really care for the shifting points of view, either the style or the additional viewpoint characters themselves. I think the talking dogs are vastly overdone. The worldbuilding (although neat in a lot of places) is badly kitchen sinky, with literally everything thrown into the same world. And Atticus is just too strong. He's always been too strong from the first book and never felt like he had/has to work at anything.</p>
<p>On the upside, Staked has a lot of the same strengths as the previous Iron Druid novels. There's a heck of a lot of world building, taking on a lot of mythology I'm otherwise not that familiar with (Irish and Slavic mythology in particular). There's also a lot of really fun lines in these books. I've highlighted more sections from a Iron Druid novel than most other series all together... And that's enough to bring this right back up to four stars by itself. Here:</p>
<p><em>I had to suppress a shudder, because semi-sentient facial hair is viscerally disturbing.</em> (As an aside, those guys are among the coolest characters I've seen in urban fantasy.)</p>
<p><em>I had to skedaddle, which I think is the best possible word for getting the hell out when a poltergeist thinks you’ve jilted her.</em></p>
<p><em>"Defend the honor of your arse-munching couch.”</em></p>
<p><em>Normally I wouldn’t bother punching a stone. Your fingers would break long before the stone would, and rock doesn’t make any noises to let you know it’s hurt.</em></p>
<p><em>Purposefully seeking out a poltergeist might be one of the dumbest things I’ve ever done. Well, that and growing muttonchops.</em></p>
<p><em>The truth is, your smarts are better hidden than a pair of snake nuts.”</em></p>
<p><em>My skin stung all over with the raw thrill of exfoliation.</em></p>
<p><em>... and a shepherd with a small flock of sheep. ‹Fluffy meat,› Orlaith comments.</em></p>
<p><em>“Fecking stew me bollocks in the queen’s own cup o’ tea,</em></p>
<p><em>I had no problem disassembling vampires in plain view but didn’t want to truly terrify anyone with my full frontal nudity.</em></p>
<p><em>‹Hey, did that guy just call me gross?› Oberon asked. Yes, but that means big in French, as it does in German.</em></p>
<p><em>The saucier got saucy with me and demanded that I leave.</em></p>
<p><em>“Of course not. As the famous Vulcan said on more than one occasion, I wish for you to enjoy extreme old age and economic bounty.”</em></p>
<p><em>There’s harmony there to be found, and I’ll fight for it, and damn the paradox of fighting for peace.</em></p>
<p><em>“Yeah, I just asked where the weird was happening in the world, and she pointed me here. And look! You’re right next to it!”</em></p>
<p><em>Or, to be more specific, an unholy horde of Guilt Ferrets. They’re bastards.</em></p>
<p><em>“Since I’ve become a Druid, I’ve seen some pretty weird shit, Atticus,” Granuaile said, “but Beardy Baggins there squaring off against Squid Head McGee in the snow might be the weirdest.”</em></p>
<p><em>‹Yeah, finally! I’ve been wanting to tell you that I think you’re an amazing hound. I knew from the moment I first sniffed your ass that we would get along!›</em></p>
<p>So yeah. I'll keep on reading them if only for that. :)</p>
<p>Plus, I think there's only supposed to be one more? I want to see how it all ends. A lot of the plot lines were tied up rather happily by the end of Staked, but that only leaves the proverbial shit to really hit the fan when armageddon rolls around...</p>

<!--more-->
<p>My basic set up is one that I've used before. I'll use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">docker-compose</a> to run a web server running <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">flask</a> behind an <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/">nginx reverse proxy</a> (for performance reasons and to serve static files).</p>
<p>Basically, I want a server that when I hit it will give a list of all books in a folder. If I click any of those, it will generate an RSS feed that I can then give to my podcasting application. That in turn can make requests for any of the MP3 files that make up the book, which should be served back to the app. Simple as pie, no? Well, mostly.</p>
<p>Creating a list of books is easy:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>@app.route('/')
def index():
    result = '&lt;ul&gt;'

    for path in sorted(os.listdir('books')):
        config_path = os.path.join('books', path, 'book.yml')
        print(config_path)

        if not os.path.exists(config_path):
            continue

        with open(config_path, 'r') as fin:
            config = yaml.load(fin)

        result += '&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="feed/{path}.xml"&gt;{title} by {author}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;'.format(
            path = path,
            title = config['title'],
            author = config['author']
        )

    result += '&lt;/ul&gt;'
    return result</code></pre>
<p>Note: Each book is a subdirectory of the folder <code>books</code>. Each book must also contain at least one file named <code>book.yml</code> which defines the <code>title</code> and <code>author</code> of the book, along with any number of MP3 files (we'll see that in a moment).</p>
<p>All this script does is generate an HTML unordered list (<code>ul</code>) of links to individual RSS feeds. We generate those in turn with:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>@app.route('/feed/&lt;feed&gt;.xml')
def get_feed(feed):
    config_path = os.path.join('books', feed, 'book.yml')

    with open(config_path, 'r') as fin:
        config = yaml.load(fin)

    fg = feedgen.feed.FeedGenerator()
    fg.load_extension('podcast')

    host_url = flask.request.scheme + '://' + flask.request.host

    feed_link = host_url + '/feed/{feed}.xml'.format(feed = feed)

    fg.id = feed_link
    fg.title(config['title'])
    fg.description('{title} by {author}'.format(title = config['title'], author = config['author']))
    fg.author(name = config['author'])
    fg.link(href = feed_link, rel = 'alternate')

    fg.podcast.itunes_category('Arts')

    for file in sorted(os.listdir(os.path.join('books', feed))):
        if not file.endswith('.mp3'):
            continue

        name = file.rsplit('.', 1)[0]

        feed_entry_link = host_url + '/feed/{feed}/{file}'.format(feed = feed, file = file)

        fe = fg.add_entry()

        fe.id(feed_entry_link)
        fe.title(name)
        fe.description('{title} by {author} - {chapter}'.format(
            title = config['title'],
            author = config['author'],
            chapter = name,
        ))
        fe.enclosure(feed_entry_link, 0, 'audio/mpeg')

    return fg.rss_str(pretty = True)</code></pre>
<p>Here, I basically just read in the <code>book.yml</code> file and any MP3s in the directory and generate a feed. As I did previously in my post on <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/05/11/generating-youtube-user-rss-feeds">Generating YouTube user RSS feeds</a>, I'm using the <a href="https://lkiesow.github.io/python-feedgen/">feedgen</a> package to generate the RSS feeds. This time I'm using their built in <code>podcast</code> extension. Nice.</p>
<p>After that, we just need to serve the MP3s. Originally I was going to serve this with flask as well, but since I'm already going to use nginx as a performance / caching layer, we can use that to serve static files. Something like this for an nginx configuration:</p>
<pre class="nginx"><code>server {
    root /var/www/;

    location / {
        try_files $uri @server;
    }

    location @server {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_pass http://server:5000;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Essentially, it will <code>try_files</code> to see if there's a static file at the path requested first. If that fails, it will fall back to the <code>@server</code> reverse proxy, which just feeds traffic to the flask server.</p>
<p>To get everything working together, we'll use docker-compose:</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>server:
    build: server
    # environment: {DEBUG: True}
    ports:
        - 5000
    volumes:
        - ./books:/app/books

nginx:
    image: nginx
    links:
        - server
    ports:
        - 80:80
    volumes:
        - ./books:/var/www/feed/
        - ./nginx:/etc/nginx/conf.d/</code></pre>
<p>Since I'm mounting the <code>./books</code> directory as a volume into both containers, the <code>nginx</code> container can use it to server static files while the <code>server</code> container can use it to list files.</p>
<p>And that's about it. I have mine running with <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_basic_module.html">nginx HTTP authentication </a>, which means that I have to use <a href="http://www.downcastapp.com/">Downcast</a> (it's the only one I've used that seems to support it), but other than that it works great. It does require that you have your own server running to initially get the files onto the podcast app, but if you download them, almost all of the apps will let you turn off the server.</p>
<p>The combination of flask and docker is nice. Flask let's you quickly and easily write simple web applications. Docker makes deployment and dependency management a snap.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see the entire codebase, it's on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/podbook">podbook</a>. There are a few bits that I didn't include in the writeup above.</p>

<p>I'm a bit conflicted on this one. As you'll see in the individual reviews below, I enjoyed Revelation Space (the first book in the trilogy) and Chasm City (the same universe but only a tangentially related storyline), but I just couldn't get into the second of the trilogy: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89190.Redemption_Ark">Redemption Ark</a>. After reading about half of it over the course of a month (which is <em>far</em> longer than it normally takes me to read a book), I'm about ready to try something else. Perhaps I'll give it another try one day.</p>

<p>Nice bit of science fiction to kick off the new year.</p>
<p>Where Revelation Space really shines is showing a future that humanity might just see if we take several of the trends in current technology and thoughts that futurists hold about how the world might entail and dial them up even further.</p>
<p>We don't have a way to go faster than that the speed of light... But that's okay, since we've figured out a combination of long periods asleep and genetic/cybornetic alterations so that spacefarers don't seem to mind. This leads to some interesting thoughts on how two worlds might only get snippets of history between one another and then only when the few relativistic starships pass through, with crews that may not even count as human any more. The AIs are especially interesting, even if they're only tangential to the story, bringing up the problems that having a person-turned-copyable-computer-program might just cause.</p>
<p>There's also an interesting (spoiler laden) solution to the Fermi Paradox in there, although it took a while for everything to come together. Of everything that most makes me want to read the sequels to see if Reynolds builds on that any.</p>
<p>The plot was decent enough, although there were a few 'gotcha' moments towards the end that I wasn't entirely sure the story deserved. I like a mystery as much as the next person, but I like it best when the reader has a chance ahead of time to figure out what is going on.</p>
<p>The characters didn't feel entirely complete at times--although some of that might come from the unhuman nature of a good number of them.</p>
<p>All together, I liked it. It took far longer to read than most books I've read over the past year, but I think a large part of that wasn't due to the book. We'll give the sequel a try and see if it goes a bit quicker.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89185.Chasm_City"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/02/26/revelation-space/2-chasm-city.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Chasm City takes a bit of a step sideways from Revelation Space, which on more reading makes perfect sense. It's not a sequel but rather a novel set in the same universe, a bit earlier in the timeline.</p>
<p>From the worldbuilding perspective, this extends and deepens what came earlier in Revelation Space, in particularly giving us a few insights into how early colonies could have been created in a universe without faster than light travel, the origins of the Melding Plague, and more backstory about Chasm City. All around, a very interesting world. It's a relatively grim possible future, but a well imagined one.</p>
<p>So far as plot goes, the story is relatively complicated, with at least timelines mixing together: a fleet of generation ships from Earth crossing between the stars, a hunting party on the war torn world they eventually settled on, and a quarry chased into the strange, plague ravaged world of Chasm City. Especially towards the end, it starts to get a little blurry exactly what is going on, but that's part of the draw of the story's climax. It's an <i>unreliable narrator</i> taken to an interesting extreme.</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed it. I'm not sure if I should have read Redemption Ark next or if it's not particularly relevant, but either way I liked the extra depth that Chasm City brings to its universe.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, I haven't actually finished this book yet.</p>
<p>What we have thus far is interesting, getting more into the encroaching threat that first came about through the latter half of Revelation Space. We also get tiebacks to the starship <em>Nostalgia for Infinity</em> and finally get to learn exactly why they have such a terrifying array of weapons... or at least where they came from.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of this story talks about a war spanning large swatches of humanity--which is fascinating when you take into account how long it takes to do anything on an interstellar scale without faster than light travel. One side of the conflict--the Conjoiners, or spiders as they are colloquially known--are particularly interesting. With cybernetic implants and early hints of a hive mind... There is a lot of interesting space to explore there.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure what's preventing me from finishing the book. It could be pacing; it could be characters; but nothing in particular is jumping to mind. It could just not be the book I'm looking for right now. As I mentioned before, perhaps I'll come back to it some day.</p>

<p>Next up on the physical book front, I'm reading book 8 of the <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/02/20/the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25337294-staked">Staked</a>. This will be a first for me, reading a new book in a series I've already reviewed. I'm not sure if I'll put up a new post or just update what I've done before. I guess we'll see when I've finished it. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>]]></content></entry></feed>
