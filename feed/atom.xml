&lt;p>Moira gets a chance to do what she loves&amp;ndash;and is as Moira about it the entire season as possible. So much David and Patrick, which is great. Alexis is really growing, which is awesome&amp;ndash;she has a ways to go yet though. Also Stevie gets a few moments to shine, she&amp;rsquo;s really the surprise soul of this series in a lot of ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only one more season!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Last Uncharted Sky</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/28/the-last-uncharted-sky/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/28/the-last-uncharted-sky/</guid><description>Where An Alchemy of Masques and Mirrors was mystery and religious fiddling and A Labyrinth of Scions and Sorcery was a political story, culminating in a fall of power (or at least a shift), The Last Uncharted Sky shifts yet again. This time we have a (aero)nautical adventure with skyships, pirates, lost treasures, and found families.

&lt;p>Well that was quite a continuation. Out of one apocalypse and right into another. This time in the 1960s!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat concept and gives the characters a bit more time to grow&amp;ndash;while at the same time the viewers know there&amp;rsquo;s quite the timeline. And with time travel&amp;hellip; you can kill people off and still have to deal with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also instead of Hazel and Cha-Chat, you have three Swedish brothers (less amusing, far more terrifying).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I quite enjoyed it. And there&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;em>plenty&lt;/em> of room left for Season 3. A quick search shows February 2022&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m going to go with a probably not on that. But still soon!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Runelang: The Lexer</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/24/runelang-the-lexer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/24/runelang-the-lexer/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis">LEX&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this is actually one of the easier parts of a programming language. In this case, we need to turn the raw text of a program into a sequence of tokens / lexemes that will be easier to parse. In this case, we want to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Remove all whitespace and comments&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Death and pregnancy; the Rose children growing up, Johnny finally has something to do, and Moira is&amp;hellip; Moira. Oy&amp;ndash;ra.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a bit amused that we got the pregnancy storyline &lt;span class="spoiler">without Jocelyn's actress even being pregnant IRL; I feel like that's the more common reason to work in something like this. It works though!&lt;/span>

&lt;p>On the 12th hour of the first day of October 1989, 43 women around the world gave birth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was unusual only in the fact that none of these women had been pregnant when the day first began.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sir Reginald Hargreeves, eccentric billionaire and adventurer, resolved to locate and adopt as many of the children as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh that&amp;rsquo;s quite a show. After &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/23/the-umbrella-academy-vol.-1-the-apocalypse-suite/">reading through the graphic novels&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s a rather different experience.

It&amp;rsquo;s got great songs, fun characters, beautiful animation, and a lovely story. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to see a story based on yet another culture&amp;ndash;Columbia this time&amp;ndash;Disney is really doing that well.

Onward! Maybe to something new?
Individual thoughts (spoilers):
Lapdogs and Englishmen That’s what I was looking for. Great art style, interesting story. Bit of magic (ish), bits of fate.
Oh Constantine. It fits though. 5

On the good side, we have the logs stored as JSON objects (archived from Datadog which collects them). On the down side&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a huge amount of data. Not as much as I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with at previous jobs/in some academic problems, but we&amp;rsquo;re still talking on the order of terabytes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, write up a quick Python script, fire and forget. It takes maybe ten minutes to write the code and (for this specific example) half an hour to run it on the specific cloud instance the logs lived on. So we&amp;rsquo;ll start with that. But then I got thinking&amp;hellip; Python is supposed to be super slow right? Can I do better?&lt;/p>

So Python actually for the most part does just fine.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 14: Good Intentions</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/11/hellblazer-vol.-14-good-intentions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/11/hellblazer-vol.-14-good-intentions/</guid><description>That’s a few hard hitting stories. Hard Times is about Constantine in prison. Weird art style and hard to read. Good Intentions is the aftermath… people are terrible. Freezes Over it’s a pretty good locked room mystery with just the possibility of something more.

Overal though, it seems&amp;hellip; rather lackluster.

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s really picking up now! I&amp;rsquo;m actually starting to really enjoy the relationships between the characters. David is still my favorite, but Alexis ia really growing on me. And I still don&amp;rsquo;t care much for Moira.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The entire idea of David not having a (valid) driver&amp;rsquo;s license or Alexis never having graduated High School because rich/reasons&amp;hellip; actually makes a lot of sense. But Alexis actually &lt;em>going&lt;/em> to High School? In what universe would that happen&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s what GEDs are for. Really pulled me out of the plotline.&lt;/p>

When it comes to letting you know that there are critical issues in your dependencies that can be fixed simply by upgrading the package (they did all the work for you*). The biggest problem is that it can just be &lt;em>insanely&lt;/em> noisy. In a busy repo with multiple Node.JS codebases (especially), you can get dozens to even hundreds of reports a week. And for each one, you optimally would update the code&amp;hellip; but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s just not practical. So you have to decide which updates you actually apply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So. How do we do it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well the traditional rest based Github APIs don&amp;rsquo;t expose the dependabot data, &lt;em>but&lt;/em> the newer GraphQL one does! I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, I haven&amp;rsquo;t used as much GraphQL as I probably should, it&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a bit more complicated than REST.

&lt;p>It will take in any GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE HTTP request with any path/params/data (optionally JSON), pack that data into a JSON object, and both log that to a file (with a UUID1 based name) plus return this object to the request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Warning: Off hand, there is already a potential security problem in this regarding DoS. It will happily try to log anything you throw at it, no matter how big and will store those in memory first.

&lt;p>Much better than season 1! It&amp;rsquo;s still cringe, but at least David is trying, Alexis is failing, and their parents are&amp;hellip; surviving?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I appreciate about this season is how the rest of the cast is getting slightly less caricaturish. Roland is still full on Roland, but Jocelyn is really growing into a good person who&amp;rsquo;s still perfectly fine at snarking at the Rose&amp;rsquo;s. Even Bob is starting to fire back. Makes the town council &amp;lsquo;main plot&amp;rsquo; amusing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still a very quick watch. Onward to season 3.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pulling more than 5000 logs from datadog</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/25/pulling-more-than-5000-logs-from-datadog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/25/pulling-more-than-5000-logs-from-datadog/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog&lt;/a> is pretty awesome. I wish I had it at my previous job, but better late than never. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;ve used it a lot for digging through recent logs to try to construct various events for various (security related) reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the problems I&amp;rsquo;ve come into though is that eventually you&amp;rsquo;re going to hit the limits of what datadog can do. In particular, I was trying to reconstruct user&amp;rsquo;s sessions and then check if they made one specific sequence of calls or another one. So far as I know, that isn&amp;rsquo;t directly possible, so instead, I wanted to download a subset of the datadog logs and process them locally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Easy enough, yes? Well: &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67281698/datadog-export-logs-more-than-5-000">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67281698/datadog-export-logs-more-than-5-000&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Tonally&amp;hellip; &lt;em>very&lt;/em> different from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/18/mr.-robot-season-4/">Mr. Robot&lt;/a>. Bit of whiplash from that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, a rich family loses everything&amp;hellip; but the town they bought for a joke (see? rich). Now they have to go live there, with the overblown locals. A whole new way of life to learn and all the hilarious complications that come from that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not the kind of show that I usually like, since it&amp;rsquo;s just so &amp;hellip; cringey/awkward. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to watch people lose everything and just seem so &amp;hellip; bad at being human. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know anyone in that income bracket or especially anyone that&amp;rsquo;s lost so much. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it any easier to believe. They&amp;rsquo;re each quick watches at around 20 minutes though. That&amp;rsquo;s something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, there are a number of really funny moments in there. David is great, Stevie is great. Johnny&amp;ndash;I can&amp;rsquo;t get American Pie out of my head. Alexis and especially Moira aren&amp;rsquo;t great, but so it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth giving a few episodes a try. It gets better throughout the season.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Arcane</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/23/arcane/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/23/arcane/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/arcane.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>That is an absolutely beautiful delight of a show. I love the asthetic/worldbuilding, with a mix of steampunk/magic plus a major cyberpunk visual style. It&amp;rsquo;s something that I really could do with some more of and the animated style &lt;em>really&lt;/em> lends itself nicely to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, there&amp;rsquo;s a mix of a few different plots (family troubles, class war, magic versus tech, corruption in politics / power corrupts) that each work by themselves, but are particularly good when you get crossovers. Class war and politics complicated by magic versus tech. (Found and blood) family troubles through it all. Good times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the worst part of it all? It ended! And now I have to wait for Season 2!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well worth a watch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mr. Robot: Season 4</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/18/mr.-robot-season-4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/18/mr.-robot-season-4/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/mr.robot-season-4.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Wow. That really went quite a fascinating direction. I was wondering where they were going for the last few seasons, but really digging into the aftermath of the season 1 hacks + another big target + dealing with the fallout of the Dark Army + digging deeper into Elliot&amp;rsquo;s troubles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man. Quite a season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had my doubts in the run up to the final few episodes, but I think they really stuck the landing. This was quite a show, through and through. Well worth the watch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/17/harry-potter-20th-anniversary-return-to-hogwarts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/17/harry-potter-20th-anniversary-return-to-hogwarts/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/movies/harry-potter-20th-anniversary-return-to-hogwarts.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>You know&amp;hellip; I should really re-watch those movies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I expect is the case for many in roughly my age bracket, Harry Potter was a huge part of my life growing up. I think I got into it with the release of the 3rd or 4th book (can&amp;rsquo;t quite remember) and absolutely devoured each book after that the night it came out. I watched all of the movies a number of times. It was absolutely fascinating watching the characters in this other world basically growing up with me.&lt;/p>

At least to me, The Rise of Skywalker did a pretty decent job of closing the loop on the saga that began a long time ago with the rise of Palpatine and the fall of Anakin Skywalker. Really, that&amp;rsquo;s the entire story, and you get that here in spades.

I remember being&amp;hellip; somewhat disappointed. Tonally, they got away from the nostalgia of the Force Awakens. There are still some absolutely beautiful/powerful moments (the final battles over the salt flats or whatever those were were pretty cool), but not quite as strong as it was before. And there are all sorts of things that just feel &amp;lsquo;less magical&amp;rsquo; and more movie driven than anything.
This time around, I liked it a lot more.</description></item><item><title>Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/04/star-wars-episode-vii-the-force-awakens/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/04/star-wars-episode-vii-the-force-awakens/</guid><description>Woo, new Star Wars! I remember the hype when The Force Awakens first came out. It was pretty crazy to see new Star Wars for the first time (second time?) in years. And it&amp;rsquo;s pretty dang cool.

That was a year. Covid, take 2. A new job. A new baby. I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite make my 200 books this year (I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite even make it to 1/2 days), but that&amp;rsquo;s okay. I still read a giant pile. :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some stats:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>179 books read: 1 every 2.04 days (almost!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>47,236 pages read: roughly 130 pages/day&lt;/li>
&lt;li>29 audiobooks, 96 graphic novels, 18 children&amp;rsquo;s chapter books, 18 non-fiction&lt;/li>
&lt;li>56 unique authors (top were Hajime Isayama, Patricia Briggs, Warren Ellis, and Neil Gaiman)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>19 series (top were Attack on Titan, Mercy Thompson/Alpha &amp;amp; Omega, Sandman, and Runelords)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Shortest: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/21/the-shepherds-tale/">The Shepherd&amp;#39;s Tale&lt;/a> with 56 pages, longest: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/31/the-holy-bible-revised-standard-version-catholic-edition/">The Holy Bible: Revised Standard Version, Catholic Edition&lt;/a> with over 1000. That feels like cheating though, so let&amp;rsquo;s go with &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/21/rhythm-of-war/">Rhythm of War&lt;/a> at 1270 / &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/06/12/crafting-interpreters/">Crafting Interpreters&lt;/a> at 865. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most read book I read this year was &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/01/23/1984/">1984&lt;/a> with 5 million others reading it (on Goodreads alone; I was working on my earliest backlog). Least popular: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/26/tales-of-nezura-book-1-the-zevolra/">Tales of Nezura: Book 1: The Zevolra&lt;/a> with only 39. It &amp;hellip; wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad. Give it a try?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I gave 119 five-star ratings, 45 four-star, 7 three-star, and less than 10 other ratings. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the realization over the last year that I tend to like just about everything. Books in particular, they&amp;rsquo;re only on my list if I think I&amp;rsquo;d find them interesting, so of course, they&amp;rsquo;ll be rated highly&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of time.</description></item><item><title>AoC 2021 Day 22: Cubinator</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/22/aoc-2021-day-22-cubinator/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/12/22/aoc-2021-day-22-cubinator/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="source-reactor-reboothttpsadventofcodecom2021day22">Source: &lt;a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/22">Reactor Reboot&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>I really enjoyed Hawkeye.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;em>fun&lt;/em>, which compared to &lt;em>Wandvision&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Loki&lt;/em> and really even &lt;em>What If&amp;hellip;&lt;/em> is a worthwhile goal and really does a lot to show off the more human scale of superheroes. It&amp;rsquo;s never really made much sense that Hawkeye and Black Widow were Avengers&amp;hellip; and it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t. But they do it anyways. Because what Heroes do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see them building up the new &amp;lsquo;Young Avengers&amp;rsquo; and branching out as much as they are. I think Hailee Steinfeld did a great job, especially when acting against &lt;span class="spoiler">Florence Pugh's Yelena&lt;/span>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
