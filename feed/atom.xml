I barely made it, but there were so many books that I absolutely ended up loving that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I otherwise would have read. So this year, better!

It&amp;rsquo;s island life&amp;ndash;a small town, far out on the water that lives and dies by the one big event a year. Just in this case, that one event is a race involving murderous meat eating horses that come from the sea and would like eating the racers just as much as carrying them.</description></item><item><title>The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/31/the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2022 00:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/31/the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>Ashby eyed the readouts on his control screen. “I swear, our engines have never been running this smooth.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sissix spoke without looking up from her navigation controls. “That’s what happens when you take two easily-bored techs on a long haul.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Hmm. Maybe we should do this more often.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That made Sissix’s head turn. She gave him a look that could melt the hull. “Let’s not.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a great book. It&amp;rsquo;s a slice of life story, set on small starship travelling the galaxy chock full of some of the most fascinating and delightful characters I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a scifi novel in a long time. There&amp;rsquo;s not particularly a huge over-arching plot. Instead, our intrepid band of oddballs is off on a long mission (it&amp;rsquo;s a Long Way after all) to the edge (center?) of &amp;lsquo;known&amp;rsquo; space. Really, we&amp;rsquo;re just on a trip with them, through all the ups and downs, the drama and relationships. It&amp;rsquo;s exactly the sort of story I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know I was looking for. Well worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cece Rios and the Desert of Souls</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/31/cece-rios-and-the-desert-of-souls/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2022 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/31/cece-rios-and-the-desert-of-souls/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>Since before I could remember, Mamá had taught me the legends of the criaturas. They were creatures unlike humans, children of the Desert goddess, who the Great Namer created from dust and words. Mama taught me the difference between animal criaturas, who were made to fill the desert, and dark criaturas, who were made to attack the descendants of the Sun god—us. But her advice for dealing with both types was the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a delightful book. It&amp;rsquo;s a quick read (middle grade) with lovely worldbuilding (albeit a bit of whiplash reading it back to back with &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/29/black-sun/">Black Sun&lt;/a>). It&amp;rsquo;s got a touch of southwest US / Mexican mythology with Coyote myths, El Sombrerón//La Chupacabra/La Llorona and others, brujas, and touch of Pokemon/creature collection with whole loads of hearts and the power of one little girl trying to save her sister and instead&amp;ndash;perhaps&amp;ndash;accidentally changing the world along the way. It&amp;rsquo;s a great read and something that I&amp;rsquo;m definitely going to put onto the list to read to my children.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 21: The Laughing Magician</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/29/hellblazer-vol.-21-the-laughing-magician/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/29/hellblazer-vol.-21-the-laughing-magician/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>More lore around the Constantine line, hints of destiny thwarted before birth, a magic stick, and a mage hunting shark man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good times. Good times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also: Tell me there’s a series about Johanna Constantine. That’s quite the story of hers at the end of the volume.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Black Sun</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/29/black-sun/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/29/black-sun/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>“Your father thought he could forbid me to wear this,” she said calmly enough, but the boy could hear the thread of pain in her voice, the places where deprivation and sorrow had left their cracks. “But your father doesn’t understand that this is the way of my ancestors, and their ancestors before them. He cannot stop a Carrion Crow woman from dressing to honor the crow god, particularly on a day as sacred as today.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a magical book. It&amp;rsquo;s got dark and beautiful worldbuilding, some absolutely bizarre and still somehow eminently relatable characters, and quite the cliffhanger of an ending (spoilers I suppose). Well worth reading.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Changeling</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/26/the-changeling/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/26/the-changeling/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>On one level, it&amp;rsquo;s about fatherhood. Apollo grew up without a dad and vows he&amp;rsquo;s going to do better by his own son. And right from the beginning&amp;ndash;a surprise delivery no one around was quite ready for&amp;ndash;he does everything he can. As a father, with my youngest about the age of Apollo&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; when things go sideways. But we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On another level, it&amp;rsquo;s about motherhood. Emma had all sorts of issues of her own, but she and Apollo seem absolutely delightful together. So when the first signs of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/postpartum%20depression">postpartum depression&lt;/a> start, it&amp;rsquo;s terrifying and entirely too relatable to many parents out there. New babies are hard, not going to lie, and everyone deals with that completely differently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a third, it&amp;rsquo;s about fairy tales and other stories. The stories we read to our children and the stories we tell ourselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And on a last level, it&amp;rsquo;s about magic. There are hints right from the beginning that there&amp;rsquo;s something strange in this world. From Apollo&amp;rsquo;s dreams of his absent father, to the magic inheriant in old books and libraries, to finding a postcard from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister%20Crowley">Aleister Crowley&lt;/a>&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s little in the way of obviously supernatural for most of the book&amp;hellip; but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t last.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 20: Systems of Control</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/25/hellblazer-vol.-20-systems-of-control/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/25/hellblazer-vol.-20-systems-of-control/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>Constantine gets his Mojo back.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Physics of the Impossible is a really great book. It goes into a wide variety of primarily science fictional topics in decreasingly order of likelihood and gets into how each works (so far as they do work with what we know now) and what it would take to make them possible. There&amp;rsquo;s just enough scientific background that I understood most of it and could stretch for the rest, with pointers for what to search for to learn more, which is always a good way to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read! One interesting point is how many of these seeded ideas for more stories in the future! Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Runelang: The Parser (Part 2: Expressions)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/18/runelang-the-parser-part-2-expressions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/18/runelang-the-parser-part-2-expressions/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/15/runelang-the-parser-part-1/">Earlier this week&lt;/a>, we started parsing, getting through groups, nodes, params, and lists. A pretty good start, but it also leaves out two very powerful things (expressions and defines), one of which we absolutely do need to start actually evaluating things: expressions. Since we use them in every param, we pretty much need to know how to parse them, so let&amp;rsquo;s do it!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider-Man: No Way Home</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/18/spider-man-no-way-home/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/18/spider-man-no-way-home/</guid><description>Finally got around to watching this. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did, it&amp;rsquo;s hilarious and an aboslute blast of nostalgia. Similar to Avengers: Endgame, I don&amp;rsquo;t know know if this would possibly hold up without the weight of all of the movies that came before it (I doubt it), but with that weight&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s really really good.
It&amp;rsquo;s funny, it&amp;rsquo;s touching, and there are some really crazy action scenes. But the greatest strength of course comes from bringing back a half dozen villains and all three modern live action Spider-Men into one film .</description></item><item><title>Schitt's Creek: Season 6</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/17/schitts-creek-season-6/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/17/schitts-creek-season-6/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/schitts-creek-season-6.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>And so it ends. As expected, David and Patrick&amp;rsquo;s wedding is a big storyline (and man David is neurotic when stressed), but we also have Alexis continuing to grow in relationships and work (which is such an amazing growth from Season 1), the whole hotel starting to grow (rapidly) and Moira doing Moira things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a good way to end the show. We have some ending up moving back to the lives they once had, hopefully a little more self aware (I doubt so in Moira&amp;rsquo;s case&amp;hellip;) from their time in Schitt&amp;rsquo;s Creek.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not a show I normally would have chosen, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have watched it. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 18: The Gift</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/15/hellblazer-vol.-18-the-gift/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/15/hellblazer-vol.-18-the-gift/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

Nate the Great!
They vary a bit in quality, but &amp;lsquo;Stalks Stupidweed&amp;rsquo; is pretty high up there in my opinion. It&amp;rsquo;s cute and has a few laugh out loud moments.

And less sick now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last time(s), we &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/23/runelang-language-specification/">described&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/24/runelang-the-lexer/">lexed&lt;/a> Runelang! This time around, let&amp;rsquo;s take the lexed tokens and go one step further and parse them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, how do we go about this? With a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recursive%20descent%20parser">recursive descent parser&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Start with a list/stream of tokens&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using the first &lt;em>k&lt;/em> (in a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL%28k%29%20parser">LL(k) parser&lt;/a>) elements of the list, identify which sort of object we are parsing (a &lt;code>group&lt;/code> / &lt;code>identifier&lt;/code> / &lt;code>literal&lt;/code> / &lt;code>expression&lt;/code> / etc)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Call a parsing function for that object type (&lt;code>parseGroup&lt;/code> etc) that will:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Recursively parse the given object type (this may in turn call more parse functions)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advance the token stream &amp;lsquo;consuming&amp;rsquo; any tokens used in this group so the new &amp;lsquo;first&amp;rsquo; element is the next object&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>He is interested in the discoveries of science (“intellectual daring and imaginative brilliance without parallel”), the freedoms of democracy (in particular “the great democracy of reading and writing”), the evils of authoritarianism (“always reductive whether it’s in power or not”) and the pitfalls of education (“any education that neglects the experience of delight will be a dry and tasteless diet with no nourishment in it”). He is profoundly interested in religion, while remaining puzzled by aspects of it. “The first thing to say about the Bishop’s arguments in his book,” he writes in “God and Dust,” “is that I agree with every word of them, except the words I don’t understand; and that the words I don’t understand are those such as spirit, spiritual and God.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Philip Pullman is an interesting author, which makes Daemon Voices an interesting sort of book. In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s a selected collection of essays and presentation he&amp;rsquo;s given over the years on a wide range of topics. In particular, he talks a lot about Paradise Lost (makes me want to actually read it), his religious and philosophical views (and a dive into Gnosticism) and how those interact with his writing, and a bit on writing advice and his own particular style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating look and there&amp;rsquo;s a little for everyone, so if you like what Pullman has written, you can certainly do worse than give it a chance!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are a few interesting quotes that I highlighted for just about every essay. It&amp;rsquo;s not really the sort of book where one should worry about spoilers, but just in case that&amp;rsquo;s not a shared option, you have been warned. (Also: &lt;em>long&lt;/em>)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hellblazer, Vol. 16: The Wild Card</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/05/hellblazer-vol.-16-the-wild-card/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/05/hellblazer-vol.-16-the-wild-card/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">

&lt;p>Moira gets a chance to do what she loves&amp;ndash;and is as Moira about it the entire season as possible. So much David and Patrick, which is great. Alexis is really growing, which is awesome&amp;ndash;she has a ways to go yet though. Also Stevie gets a few moments to shine, she&amp;rsquo;s really the surprise soul of this series in a lot of ways.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well that was quite a continuation. Out of one apocalypse and right into another. This time in the 1960s!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat concept and gives the characters a bit more time to grow&amp;ndash;while at the same time the viewers know there&amp;rsquo;s quite the timeline. And with time travel&amp;hellip; you can kill people off and still have to deal with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also instead of Hazel and Cha-Chat, you have three Swedish brothers (less amusing, far more terrifying).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I quite enjoyed it. And there&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;em>plenty&lt;/em> of room left for Season 3.

&lt;p>On the 12th hour of the first day of October 1989, 43 women around the world gave birth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was unusual only in the fact that none of these women had been pregnant when the day first began.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sir Reginald Hargreeves, eccentric billionaire and adventurer, resolved to locate and adopt as many of the children as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh that&amp;rsquo;s quite a show. After &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2020/11/23/the-umbrella-academy-vol.-1-the-apocalypse-suite/">reading through the graphic novels&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s a rather different experience.

It&amp;rsquo;s got great songs, fun characters, beautiful animation, and a lovely story. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to see a story based on yet another culture&amp;ndash;Columbia this time&amp;ndash;Disney is really doing that well.

On the good side, we have the logs stored as JSON objects (archived from Datadog which collects them). On the down side&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a huge amount of data. Not as much as I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with at previous jobs/in some academic problems, but we&amp;rsquo;re still talking on the order of terabytes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, write up a quick Python script, fire and forget. It takes maybe ten minutes to write the code and (for this specific example) half an hour to run it on the specific cloud instance the logs lived on. So we&amp;rsquo;ll start with that. But then I got thinking&amp;hellip; Python is supposed to be super slow right? Can I do better?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>That’s a few hard hitting stories. Hard Times is about Constantine in prison. Weird art style and hard to read. Good Intentions is the aftermath… people are terrible. Freezes Over it’s a pretty good locked room mystery with just the possibility of something more.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s really picking up now! I&amp;rsquo;m actually starting to really enjoy the relationships between the characters. David is still my favorite, but Alexis ia really growing on me. And I still don&amp;rsquo;t care much for Moira.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The entire idea of David not having a (valid) driver&amp;rsquo;s license or Alexis never having graduated High School because rich/reasons&amp;hellip; actually makes a lot of sense.

When it comes to letting you know that there are critical issues in your dependencies that can be fixed simply by upgrading the package (they did all the work for you*). The biggest problem is that it can just be &lt;em>insanely&lt;/em> noisy. In a busy repo with multiple Node.JS codebases (especially), you can get dozens to even hundreds of reports a week. And for each one, you optimally would update the code&amp;hellip; but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s just not practical. So you have to decide which updates you actually apply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So. How do we do it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well the traditional rest based Github APIs don&amp;rsquo;t expose the dependabot data, &lt;em>but&lt;/em> the newer GraphQL one does! I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, I haven&amp;rsquo;t used as much GraphQL as I probably should, it&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a bit more complicated than REST. But it does expose what I need.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Brothers of War The Iron Brigade at Gettysburg</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/03/brothers-of-war-the-iron-brigade-at-gettysburg/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/02/03/brothers-of-war-the-iron-brigade-at-gettysburg/</guid><description>“But at a great cost,” Williams continued, looking at the men and pointing in the direction where the Nineteenth suffered so horrendously. “The cost will be felt in hundreds of homes, factories, and farms back in Indiana…not only now, but for generations.

I needed it to test what a webhook actually returned to me, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that there are a number of other things it could be dropped in for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will take in any GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE HTTP request with any path/params/data (optionally JSON), pack that data into a JSON object, and both log that to a file (with a UUID1 based name) plus return this object to the request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Warning: Off hand, there is already a potential security problem in this regarding DoS. It will happily try to log anything you throw at it, no matter how big and will store those in memory first. So long running requests / large requests / many requests will quickly eat up your RAM/disk. So&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t leave this running unattended? At least not without additional configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it!

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Much better than season 1! It&amp;rsquo;s still cringe, but at least David is trying, Alexis is failing, and their parents are&amp;hellip; surviving?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I appreciate about this season is how the rest of the cast is getting slightly less caricaturish. Roland is still full on Roland, but Jocelyn is really growing into a good person who&amp;rsquo;s still perfectly fine at snarking at the Rose&amp;rsquo;s. Even Bob is starting to fire back. Makes the town council &amp;lsquo;main plot&amp;rsquo; amusing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still a very quick watch. Onward to season 3.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pulling more than 5000 logs from datadog</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/25/pulling-more-than-5000-logs-from-datadog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/25/pulling-more-than-5000-logs-from-datadog/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog&lt;/a> is pretty awesome. I wish I had it at my previous job, but better late than never. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;ve used it a lot for digging through recent logs to try to construct various events for various (security related) reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the problems I&amp;rsquo;ve come into though is that eventually you&amp;rsquo;re going to hit the limits of what datadog can do. In particular, I was trying to reconstruct user&amp;rsquo;s sessions and then check if they made one specific sequence of calls or another one. So far as I know, that isn&amp;rsquo;t directly possible, so instead, I wanted to download a subset of the datadog logs and process them locally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Easy enough, yes? Well: &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67281698/datadog-export-logs-more-than-5-000">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67281698/datadog-export-logs-more-than-5-000&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out, you just can&amp;rsquo;t export more than 5000 logs directly. &lt;em>But&lt;/em>&amp;hellip; they have an API with pagination!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Schitt's Creek: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/24/schitts-creek-season-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/24/schitts-creek-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/schitts-creek-season-1.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Tonally&amp;hellip; &lt;em>very&lt;/em> different from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/18/mr.-robot-season-4/">Mr. Robot&lt;/a>. Bit of whiplash from that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, a rich family loses everything&amp;hellip; but the town they bought for a joke (see? rich). Now they have to go live there, with the overblown locals. A whole new way of life to learn and all the hilarious complications that come from that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not the kind of show that I usually like, since it&amp;rsquo;s just so &amp;hellip; cringey/awkward. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to watch people lose everything and just seem so &amp;hellip; bad at being human. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know anyone in that income bracket or especially anyone that&amp;rsquo;s lost so much. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it any easier to believe. They&amp;rsquo;re each quick watches at around 20 minutes though. That&amp;rsquo;s something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, there are a number of really funny moments in there. David is great, Stevie is great. Johnny&amp;ndash;I can&amp;rsquo;t get American Pie out of my head. Alexis and especially Moira aren&amp;rsquo;t great, but so it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth giving a few episodes a try. It gets better throughout the season.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Arcane</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/23/arcane/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/23/arcane/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/arcane.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>That is an absolutely beautiful delight of a show. I love the asthetic/worldbuilding, with a mix of steampunk/magic plus a major cyberpunk visual style. It&amp;rsquo;s something that I really could do with some more of and the animated style &lt;em>really&lt;/em> lends itself nicely to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, there&amp;rsquo;s a mix of a few different plots (family troubles, class war, magic versus tech, corruption in politics / power corrupts) that each work by themselves, but are particularly good when you get crossovers. Class war and politics complicated by magic versus tech. (Found and blood) family troubles through it all. Good times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the worst part of it all? It ended! And now I have to wait for Season 2!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well worth a watch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mr. Robot: Season 4</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/18/mr.-robot-season-4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/18/mr.-robot-season-4/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/tv/mr.robot-season-4.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Wow. That really went quite a fascinating direction. I was wondering where they were going for the last few seasons, but really digging into the aftermath of the season 1 hacks + another big target + dealing with the fallout of the Dark Army + digging deeper into Elliot&amp;rsquo;s troubles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man. Quite a season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had my doubts in the run up to the final few episodes, but I think they really stuck the landing. This was quite a show, through and through. Well worth the watch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/17/harry-potter-20th-anniversary-return-to-hogwarts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/17/harry-potter-20th-anniversary-return-to-hogwarts/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/movies/harry-potter-20th-anniversary-return-to-hogwarts.jpg"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>You know&amp;hellip; I should really re-watch those movies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I expect is the case for many in roughly my age bracket, Harry Potter was a huge part of my life growing up. I think I got into it with the release of the 3rd or 4th book (can&amp;rsquo;t quite remember) and absolutely devoured each book after that the night it came out. I watched all of the movies a number of times. It was absolutely fascinating watching the characters in this other world basically growing up with me.&lt;/p>

At least to me, The Rise of Skywalker did a pretty decent job of closing the loop on the saga that began a long time ago with the rise of Palpatine and the fall of Anakin Skywalker. Really, that&amp;rsquo;s the entire story, and you get that here in spades.
There were definitely some weird choices made in pacing (in particular, right at the beginning, they sort of drop the whole &amp;lsquo;Emperor is back&amp;rsquo; thing on us&amp;hellip; apparently the reveal came in &amp;hellip; Fortnite?</description></item><item><title>Two Counties</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/11/two-counties/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/01/11/two-counties/</guid><description>Travel for a funeral, take advantage of the beauty of cold nature and a camping trip to Brown County.

Mini-reviews and pretty pictures (spoilers):
Haunted That’s a story. Enough time to breathe, a cast of new and interesting story, and all sorts of gross and creepy scenes.
Part One Oy. Although you can’t say she’s wrong.
Murder scene description: oy that’s graphic.</description></item></channel></rss>
