<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/49121-rama">Rama</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7779.Arthur_C_Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/65129.Gentry_Lee">Gentry Lee</a>.</p>
<p>I'm going to try something a little different this time. On previous series, I found it hard to write a blog post after reading several books back to back, I've been reviewing each book individual <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8261480-jp">on Goodreads</a> as I've read it. I have a short summary for the entire series, followed by the individual books. We'll see how it goes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Overall, I like the first book (the only by only <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7779.Arthur_C_Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, the rest were all co-authored by<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/65129.Gentry_Lee">Gentry Lee</a>). It's the kind of science fiction driven not particularly by plot or character, but rather by discovery and exploration. It's not always done well, but in this case I particularly enjoyed it. Conversely though, the other three in the series have much more focus on character conflict and to a lesser extent (but more than Rama) a central plot.</p>
<p>That change in style really turned me off the second book in the series, to the extent that I almost didn't finish the series. I'm glad I did though. Each of the sequels (in particularly the first part of #2 and most of #4) has some interesting ideas and solid extensions of Clarke's original world.</p>
<p>If you're into more interested in the science part of science fiction, you could do far worse than Rama. If, on the other hand, you want a story with more depth to the characters and plots, give Rama II a chance (although just keep in mind that Rama and Rama II are fairly different). If you are a completionist, the last book is actually pretty good and does a reasonably good job of tying up a lot of loose ends from the previous books.</p>
<p>Now, the individual reviews. Warning, there will be (usually minor) spoilers!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112537.Rendezvous_with_Rama"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/06/21/rama/1-rendezvous-with-rama.jpg" /></a></p>
<h3>Rama</h3>
<p>It's been a little while since I've read much science fiction, particularly any of the sort that Clarke is known for. Forget strong plot or characters and focus entirely around the big idea: In this case, the starship Rama is plenty large.</p>
<p>It starts off quickly, only a few chapters before you're on the ship. From there, you have situation after situation, describing how interesting the world that Clarke has built is and how the explorers react to it. The lack of a more specific antagonist becomes more of a problem towards then end, in that the book just sort of ends. There are various problems throughout the book, but no sense of building. I'm still not entirely sure how much I like this style.</p>
<p>Overall though, I think it's a cool world and I want to know more. Given that the sequels were written many years later and co-written by an author with a somewhat different style (based on the forward in Rama II), it will be interesting to see how different they are.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112520.Rama_II"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/06/21/rama/2-rama-ii.jpg" /></a></p>
<h3>Rama II</h3>
<p>This book feels rather different from Rendezvous with Rama.</p>
<p>For the first half, I wasn't sure that I actually liked the difference. Rather than the almost sterile science fiction that Clarke is better known for, the sequel deals a lot more with characters, drama, and to some extent matters of faith. It's especially interesting in how long it takes them to even get to Rama, especially compared to the first book.</p>
<p>Through the next quarter though, it really started picking up. I started to actually care about the characters and couldn't put it down. The feel of the ship, especially with some of the new findings, is just different enough that I wanted to know more.</p>
<p>At first, I wasn't sure that I was going to read the other two sequels. After this, I'm not sure how I couldn't.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112518.The_Garden_of_Rama"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/06/21/rama/3-the-garden-of-rama.jpg" /></a></p>
<h3>The Garden of Rama</h3>
<p>Like Rama #2, I went back and forth while reading this one on if I was actually enjoying it or if I would finish it at all. In the end, I did finish it and I think I'll even start the last one mostly out of a sense of completionism.</p>
<p>Essentially, there are five sections:</p>
<p>In the first, the three explorers from Rama II are leaving the solar system at high speeds. The parts where they are exploring the ship and learning how to live with the local 3D printer and interacting with other alien species is neat. The part where they decide that two men and a woman are enough to start a colony... That's just a little weird. I missed the first book, where the science and sense of exploration was the core of the story.</p>
<p>In the second, they get to a sort of routing section and finally meet an alien intelligence (even if it's still a robot). They (and by extension, we) get some neat answers. I liked this section for precisely the same reason I didn't like the first section: it's about exploring the world of Rama.</p>
<p>In the third, they go back to Earth, both in the context of the story and for a few scenes. They are all new characters and I cannot figure out why I care about any of them. Then they're sent off to a colony on Mars, except... surprise, they're actually going to make a new colony on the rebuilt Rama II. This is fine, but I feel like it could have been shortened.</p>
<p>In the fourth, the colony grows and thrives. Or not. Turns out people are people and people are terrible. Really, this whole section was depressing and not really what I was hoping to see in this book. I liked the smaller scales of the first 2.5 books. This not so much. Especially since it all ends up with exactly the sort of power struggle and corruption that I both see as entirely too plausible and hope isn't actually inevitable in such situations.</p>
<p>Finally, there's a big jump in the last ten percent or so where Robert goes to meet with the avian colony from the previous books. Suffice it to say, they have a strange lifecycle that we'd previously , which would have been much more interesting had Orson Scott Card not done it ~4 years earlier in Speaker for the Dead. It is exactly the sort of thing I wanted though, I just wish it had more relation to the rest of the story and had more than 10% of the pages. This is why I'm reading the 4th book, hoping there will be more of this.</p>

<h3>Rama Revealed</h3>
<p>In my opinion, this was by far the best of the sequels.</p>
<p>They start by doing exactly what I wanted out of the middle two books: getting away from the human settlement and into a situation where they are learning and experiencing something strange. In this case, they go to live among the octospiders, an intelligent civilization highly skilled in genetics and biological science who are completely deaf and only speak in color. It's a fascinating and nicely thought out situation and I did like it.</p>
<p>Even when, halfway through the book, the focus shifts back partially to the rest of the human colony in Rama, it still maintains a tight focus, with the bigger scale events going on behind the scenes. There was still a particular feel of exploring how different societies deal with issues (such as war: the octospiders view all war as terrible, not just certain kinds).</p>
<p>The final section, when the return to another Node felt a little strange. Either because it was rushed or because it felt sort of artificial. I didn't particularly mind though, since it still was working out echoes of events from all of the previous books and acted as a sufficient capstone to the series. I did think it was nice that Michael and Simone make another appearance, even if the latter replied her mother's odd fixation with a two person continuation of the species.</p>
<p>At the very end, the book veers somewhat towards a philosophical / religions tangent, which felt a little odd (the Ramas are essentially God) but still thought provoking.</p>
<p>Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this book. If you made it through the middle two books, you should probably read this one as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>Side note: I didn't finish Whitechapel Gods (which was actually next on my original <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a>) since, after 20%, I just really wasn't getting into it. There are some really interesting ideas (a steampunkification disease for example), but it was hard to get a grasp on exactly what was going on. So it goes.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>It's a bummer, because it's such a fascinating world. I like the idea (shared by <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/02/20/the-iron-druid-chronicles">The Iron Druid Chronicles</a>) that not only are the gods still walking among us, but also that a god can have more than one form, depending on how and when it was worshipped. I like the idea that the old gods are pissed at the new gods (Media / The Internet) for encroaching on their territory. I like how the old gods feel more 'human', only somehow <em>more</em> yet also somehow <em>less</em>.</p>
<p>But the story itself drags at points, with several sections (the dreams in particular) which I thought were interesting, but I wasn't entirely sure why they were there. I've heard it said that Gaiman cut half of American Gods even before it was released, but at ~650 pages, it's still a hefty tome. I think it could have lost a little more.</p>
<p>Conversely, I did think that most of the characters were pretty solid. I thought Shadow was a solid enough protagonist, going along with a world gone mad until he'd had enough... and then a step or two more. I felt for Mr. Wednesday, trying to take back pieces of a world gone wrong. I liked the little hints and pieces of how the gods' lives had changed on coming to the new world.</p>
<p>All in all, it's the sort of book that I'm glad that I've read... but I doubt I will ever reread. There are a few interesting ideas buried in there that I'm sure will surface years from now, long after I've forgotten where they came from.</p>
<p>Since it took me so long (Two weeks? Was it really that long?) to read American Gods, I'm now at only 42 of 100 for my <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a>, fallen from 7 ahead to 3.

As thrilling as that channel is, it's not what I'm looking for.</p>
<p>Let's fix it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First step, we need a YouTube Data API (v3) key. Unfortunately it doesn't look like they provide un-authenticated use of the API as before. That's easy enough though, just <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application">go through the steps to register an application</a>. Next, dig through the APIs. It doesn't look like there is a way to directly get a user's videos, but you can get a list of a users 'uploads' playlist, which functions much the same way.</p>
<p>Using Python's <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests</a> library, we just have to hit the correct endpoint:</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Use the channel to get the 'uploads' playlist id
response = requests.get(
    'https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/channels',
    params = {
        'part': 'contentDetails',
        'forUsername': user,
        'key': API_KEY,
    }
)</code></pre>
<p>One example response:</p>
<pre class="json"><code>{"etag": "\"tbWC5XrSXxe1WOAx6MK9z4hHSU8/6wRGj4eVz7tGNiDQjCMuhP6B4vQ\"",
 "items": [{"contentDetails": {"googlePlusUserId": "112244684143881021368",
                               "relatedPlaylists": {"likes": "LL6nSFpj9HTCZ5t-N3Rm3-HA",
                                                    "uploads": "UU6nSFpj9HTCZ5t-N3Rm3-HA"}},
            "etag": "\"tbWC5XrSXxe1WOAx6MK9z4hHSU8/yMieoczWtu9QiK_MEdJrC0hqmdU\"",
            "id": "UC6nSFpj9HTCZ5t-N3Rm3-HA",
            "kind": "youtube#channel"}],
 "kind": "youtube#channelListResponse",
 "pageInfo": {"resultsPerPage": 5, "totalResults": 1}}</code></pre>
<p>That's some progress. Specifically, you can get the playlist ID for the user uploads:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>playlistId = response.json()['items'][0]['contentDetails']['relatedPlaylists']['uploads']</code></pre>
<p>From there, we can query the API again in order to get the most recent 20 items from that specific playlist:</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Get the most recent 20 videos on the 'uploads' playlist
response = requests.get(
    'https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems',
    params = {
        'part': 'snippet',
        'maxResults': 20,
        'playlistId': playlistId,
        'key': API_KEY
    }
)</code></pre>
<p>Some snippets from that output (it's rather large):</p>
<pre class="json"><code>{"etag": "\"tbWC5XrSXxe1WOAx6MK9z4hHSU8/PH2ohKtd9aLBba_d7dVtVUfFle0\"",

<p>In that snippets blob, we have everything we need. Specifically, the <code>title</code>, <code>thumbnails</code>, and <code>link</code> (by way of <code>resourceID.videoId</code>). Specifically, we can start to construct an RSS feed using the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedgen/">feedgen</a> library<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>:</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Generate a list of results that can be used as feed items
feed = feedgen.feed.FeedGenerator()
feed.title(user + ' (YRSS)')
feed.author({'name': user + ' (YRSS)'})
feed.id('YRSS:' + user)

for item in response.json()['items']:
    title = item['snippet']['title']
    video_id = item['snippet']['resourceId']['videoId']
    published = item['snippet']['publishedAt']
    thumbnail = item['snippet']['thumbnails']['high']['url']
    video_url = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=' + video_id

    item = feed.add_entry()
    item.title(title)
    item.link(href = video_url)
    item.published(dateutil.parser.parse(published))
    item.updated(dateutil.parser.parse(published))
    item.id(video_id)
    item.content('''
&lt;a href="{url}"&gt;&lt;img src="{img}" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="{url}"&gt;{title}&lt;/a&gt;
'''.format(
        url = video_url,
        img = thumbnail,
        title = title,
    ))</code></pre>
<p>And generate the feed:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>feed.atom_str()</code></pre>
<p>I love how (relatively) elegant that was. You don't have to worry about or even know anything about how the underlying XML will be structured.</p>
<p>Since eventually I want this to be a web service, I used Flask to generate a simple API:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>app = flask.Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/&lt;user&gt;.xml')
@app.route('/&lt;user&gt;/atom.xml')
def generatefeed(user):
    ...

<p>Therein lies the problem with the world though. It never quite gelled for me. There is quite a lot of world there, just waiting to be tapped, but it seemed too busy. It seemed to be a steampunk London torn from our world some time in the past, sent into a world where magic still holds sway--which is particularly odd. How do you have Science grow to the point it has in this story in a world where there are literal living fairies and sphinxes hanging around?</p>
<p>Also, it was never entirely clear what the rules were in the world. I don't strictly speaking have to know what the worlds are for magic systems, but I do prefer that there are rules. I never get the impression that is the case here. We have the last Witch in the world; Architects which can do... something; Tinkers with the ability to commune with Elemantals (essentially animstic spirits); and all manner of magical beasties. Don't get me wrong, there were some particularly cool visuals, it just didn't quite get beyond that.</p>
<p>Beyond the world building, the writing style was odd. There were two story lines: a rich girl rebelling against Victorian gender roles and a Tinker boy from the outskirts with the only remaining Tinker magic among his people. The former was written in first person present tense<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span>, the latter in third person. I can see where the two characters tie together, but for the most part, there seem to almost be two stories going on in parallel.</p>
<p>Finally, the love story just felt strange. Pedant Lumin/Hal/Bayne/The Architect is referred to four different ways at different points in the book; it took me a while to figure out they were all the same person. As a result, I couldn't figure out who he was and what in the world Vespa saw in him. It felt like the author was trying to make him adequately interesting, but it felt forced.</p>
<p>Overall, it took me a while to get finish this book. It never quite got to the point where I just wanted to put it down, but at the same point, it didn't keep me turning pages. So it goes. I'm sure there are many people who would enjoy this style of book. I'm just not one of them. So it goes.</p>
<p>So far, I've finished 41 of 100 books for the year, keeping me at a solid 6 books ahead of schedule<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></span>.

<p>The basic idea behind the formula is that it can encode any arbitrary bitmap (so long as it's black and white and only 106x17 pixels). Essentially under the hood everything is in base 17. First, let's fairly directly translate the original formula into Racket:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>; Tupper's "self-referential" formula
; Encodes a bitmap as an integer
(define (tupper k)
  (flomap-&gt;bitmap
   (build-flomap*
    1 106 17
    (λ (x y)
      (set! y (+ y k))
      (set! x (- 105 x))
      (cond
        [(&lt; 1/2 (floor (mod (* (floor (/ y 17)) (expt 2 (- (* -17 (floor x)) (mod (floor y) 17)))) 2)))
         (vector 0)]
        [else
         (vector 1)])))))</code></pre>
<p>One amusing caveat that we have to deal with here is that <code>modulus</code> doesn't work on numbers this large. So instead, we're going to have to do it manually:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>; Modulus that will work with really large numbers
(define (mod a b)
  (define q (floor (/ a b)))
  (define r (- a (* b q)))
  r)</code></pre>
<p>Whee!</p>
<p>Another neat trick I was playing with is "rendering" the image by adding one digit at a time (in base 10, so it's mostly noise):</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>(define (render-to target)
  (define str-target (number-&gt;string target))
  (define str-buffer (make-string (string-length str-target) #\0))

  (for/list ([i (in-range (sub1 (string-length str-target)) -1)])
    (string-set! str-buffer i (string-ref str-target i))
    (tupper (string-&gt;number str-buffer))))

&gt; (write-animated-gif
   (render-to 960939379918958884971672962127852754715004339660129306651505519271702802395266424689642842174350718121267153782770623355993237280874144307891325963941337723487857735749823926629715517173716995165232890538221612403238855866184013235585136048828693337902491454229288667081096184496091705183454067827731551705405381627380967602565625016981482083418783163849115590225610003652351370343874461848378737238198224849863465033159410054974700593138339226497249461751545728366702369745461014655997933798537483143786841806593422227898388722980000748404719)

<p>If you look carefully, you'll occasionally see flashes of the final image being rendered. This happens whenever the base-10 numbers that we're adding line up with the base-17 encoding.</p>
<p>I'm not sure it's particularly useful for anything, but I found it amusing.</p>

<p>Specifically, Year Zero starts with an interesting premise: Since the 1970s, aliens have been listening to our music--and they love it. But alien society at large also has a problem: art created by a 'primitive' species is bound by the laws of that species. In this particular case, copyright law. The end result: humanity is now due all of the universe's wealth (for better and for worse). Neat concept, yes?</p>
<p>The problem is that it starts to fall apart almost immediately. The basic conceit is that art is at the core of universal culture. That part seems fine. But in all the millions of species, we are the best at music--by a large margin. A step forward and our music seems universally loved. How that's possible in such a large universe? It's hard to swallow.</p>
<p>On the other hand I did like is the idea that in such a huge universe, just about every sort of alien life is possible. Life that looks like parrots... vacuum cleaners... and life that looks <em>almost</em> exactly like us. That's not a problem though, with that many species, chances are pretty good that one or more would end up just like us.</p>
<p>An interesting note is that the author of the book--<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6423803.Rob_Reid?ref=ru_lihp_nsup_as.6423803_0_mclk">Rob Reid</a> founded the company that developed Rhapsody. So a novel heavily invested with copyright law works well with the idea to 'write what you know'. It shows, with more details about copyright law and musical pop culture references than I personally cared for. I'm not convinced that this is a novel that is going to age well--although I guess that isn't the end of the world.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the characters are a little rough, closer to caricatures at times<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>. The plot is a little uneven, taking a while to get moving, then each conclusion in turn--including the finale--comes too suddenly.  When I first started Year Zero, I wasn't sure that I was even going to finish it. Around 20% in, something clicked and suddenly it was a few hours later and I'd finished it. If you liked the Hitchhiker's Guide, you'll probably like this book.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>My first thought in re-reading these books? Wow, those got weird. I'd forgotten how philosophical they get. There are hints of the same in most of Card's works, especially as you get to some of his more recent writings. The first of the three--Speaker for the Dead--is relatively straight forward through most of it. The pequeninos are a neat concept for an alien race (give Card credit for that, each of the species in the Enderverse actually manages to feel alien) and the story is relatively straight forward. It actually makes some sort of sense that--after having skipped through three thousand years of history--Ender would be drawn right to the next aliens. A chance for forgiveness for his sins of all those years ago.</p>
<p>Once you get past that into the other two books though--that's when things get weird. Don't get me wrong. I actually like the discussions about aiúa. It's in the interesting category of fiction which makes me think what if... what if that's how the world actually did work? Would that be so bad? It does drag on at times, but it's still an interesting concept.</p>
<p>Then there's the change in focus, bringing in the world of Path in Xenocide and then both Divine Wind and Pacifica in Children of the Mind. If it were any other books, I think hat I would have liked to see how he built up the cultures, so different from anything I personally have much experience with. But in the context of Speaker for the Dead--it just feels off. Like there are two completely separate stories going on that got smooshed together at some point.</p>
<p>All together though, I still do greatly enjoy all five books in the Ender Quintet, each for different reasons. Ender's Game is near the top of my personal science fiction list with Speaker for the Dead as a worthwhile successor. Xenocide and Children of the Dead are a little lower, but interesting to read if you want a bit of a different philosophy for a little while. I have less of a history with Ender in Exile, but it's a good follow up to the others, just a little less deep--which sometimes is a good thing.</p>
<p>Next up, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12953520-year-zero">Year Zero</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6423803.Rob_Reid">Rob Reid</a>. From what I've read about it, I remain cautiously optimistic. The premise sounds fascinating (aliens were pirating our music for decades and just now realize that--by our laws--they own more money than there is in the universe). Conversely though, it's been compared to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Perhaps it's blasphemy, but that just wasn't my cup of tea when I last read it. We'll see how it goes.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>It's all Greek to me</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/04/17/its-all-greek-to-me" /><id>urn:uuid:b361ed4c-c170-609c-a31d-3fbc5642e648</id><updated>2015-04-17T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago an interesting article came across my RSS feeds: <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2015/04/14/its-all-greek-or-chinese-or-spanish-or-to-me/">It’s All Greek (or Chinese or Spanish or…) to Me</a>.

<p>When I posted the link to Facebook, I got a quick question: are there any cycles? While one could just scan through the document, it would be a lot more interesting (at least to me!) if you could do it automatically. Let's toss together a quick script to do it.</p>
<p>First thing we need: a way to get the content of the Wikipedia page. Python is great for this, with <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests</a> to grab the page and <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a> to process it:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>content = requests.get('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_to_me').text
soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(content)

table = soup.find('table', {'class': 'wikitable sortable'})

pairs = collections.defaultdict(set)

for row in table.findAll('tr'):
    cols = row.findAll('td')
    if not cols:
        continue

    if len(cols) == 5:
        srcs = [src.strip() for src in cols[0].text.split(',')]

    dsts = [dst.strip() for dst in cols[-1].text.split(',')]
    for i, dst in enumerate(dsts):
        dsts[i] = re.sub(r'[\[(].*?[\])]', '', dst)

    for src in srcs:
        if ' ' in src: continue

        for dst in dsts:
            if ' ' in dst: continue

            pairs[src].add(dst)</code></pre>
<p>Basically, we download the page. Then we go through each of the rows (<code>tr</code>). Skip any rows without column elements (<code>td</code>) as that's probably the header, otherwise, pull them out. The first column (index <code>0</code>) is the language with the idiom (English in the example) while the last column (index <code>-1</code>) is the target (Greek). There's one caveat though, that sometimes the table uses a <code>rowspan</code> when one source can have multiple targets but is only listed once. We check that by only changing the <code>srcs</code> when there are 5 columns.</p>
<p>Parse through all of that and what do you have?</p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pprint
&gt;&gt;&gt; pprint.pprint(dict(pairs))
{u'': set([]),
 u'Afrikaans': set([u'Greek']),
 u'Albanian': set([u'Chinese']),
 u'Arabic': set([u'Chinese', u'Garshuni']),
 ...
 u'Vietnamese': set([u'Cambodian']),
 u'Volap\xfck': set([]),
 u'Yiddish': set([u'Aramaic'])}</code></pre>
<p>Exactly what I was looking for. Okay, next step. Find any cycles in the graph. This is straight forward enough by performing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/depth_first search">depth first search</a>:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def cycle(node, seen):

    for neighbor in pairs[node]:
        new_seen = seen + [neighbor]

        if neighbor in seen:
            yield new_seen[new_seen.index(neighbor):]
        else:
            for recur in cycle(neighbor, new_seen):
                yield recur</code></pre>
<p>The basic idea is to make a generator that returns each cycle as it finds it. It does so by search down each branch, maintaining a list of all nodes it has <code>seen</code>. If it sees the same node twice, that's a cycle. Otherwise, try all of the neighbors. We avoid infinite loops since there's a guaranteed base case to the recursion: <code>seen</code> is always one bigger on each step and it's maximum size is the number of nodes in the graph.</p>
<p>So how does it work?</p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for result in cycle('English', ['English']):
...     print result
...
['English', u'Greek', u'Chinese', u'English']
['English', u'Greek', u'Turkish', u'Arabic', u'Chinese', u'English']
['English', u'Greek', u'Turkish', u'French', u'Chinese', u'English']
['English', u'Greek', u'Turkish', u'French', u'Hebrew', u'Chinese', u'English']
['English', u'Dutch', u'Chinese', u'English']</code></pre>
<p>Neat! We've already found 5 cycles that involve English alone. But how many cycles are there all together? For that, we need a way to determine if a cycle is actually unique. If you have the cycles <code>A -> B -> C -> A</code>, that's the same as <code>B -> C -> A -> B</code>. You can do this by putting the cycles in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lexical_order">lexical order</a> (so that the 'smallest' element in the cycle is first).</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def reorder(cycle):
    if cycle[0] == cycle[-1]:
        cycle = cycle[1:]

    smallest = min(cycle)
    for el in list(cycle):
        if el == smallest:
            break
        else:
            cycle = cycle[1:] + [cycle[0]]

    return cycle</code></pre>
<p>It also is smart enough that if we pass it a list with the first and last node the same (as we will), it trims that off automatically.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; reorder(['A', 'B', 'C', 'A'])
['A', 'B', 'C']
&gt;&gt;&gt; reorder(['B', 'C', 'A', 'B'])
['A', 'B', 'C']</code></pre>
<p>Bam. So we use that and a <code>set</code> to keep track of what we've seen:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; seen = set()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for src in pairs.keys():
...     for result in cycle(src, [src]):
...         result = reorder(result)
...         if not str(result) in seen:
...             print(result)
...             seen.add(str(result))
...
[u'Chinese', u'English', u'Greek']
[u'Chinese', u'English', u'Dutch']
[u'Arabic', u'Chinese', u'English', u'Greek', u'Turkish']
[u'Chinese', u'English', u'Greek', u'Turkish', u'French']
[u'Chinese', u'English', u'Greek', u'Turkish', u'French', u'Hebrew']</code></pre>
<p>Huh. So they all go through English. I didn't actually expect that. :) Still, it's cool to be able to unify them like that.</p>
<p>Okay, one last trick. Let's visualize them. Luckily, there's a nice Python interface for <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphviz">graphviz</a> that we can use:</p>
<pre class="python"><code># --- Render a nice graph ---

g = graphviz.Digraph()
for src in pairs.keys():
    for dst in pairs[src]:
        g.edge(src, dst)

g.graph_attr['overlap'] = 'false'
g.graph_attr['splines'] = 'true'

g.format = 'png'
g.engine = 'neato'

g.render('greek-to-me')</code></pre>

<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>It's not the easiest thing in the world to read, but if you look carefully you can pick out a few interesting things. Let's tweak it a bit to color nodes if and only if they have both an inward edge and an outward one:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>for src in pairs.keys():
    # Does this node lead to another
    has_out = pairs[src]

    # Does any node lead to this one
    has_in = False
    for dst in pairs.keys():
        if src in pairs[dst]:
            has_in = True
            break

    # If both, color it
    if has_out and has_in:
        g.node(src, color = 'blue')
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/04/17/its-all-greek-to-me/greek-to-me-color-nodes.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/04/17/its-all-greek-to-me/greek-to-me-color-nodes.png" /></a></p>
<p>That's a little better, all of the nodes in any cycle are in there. Let's go ahead and show all of the edges in any cycle:</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Get all edges that are part of a cycle
cycle_edges = set()
for cycle in cycles:
    for src, dst in zip(cycle, cycle[1:]):
        cycle_edges.add((src, dst))
    cycle_edges.add((cycle[-1], cycle[0]))

for src in pairs.keys():
    for dst in pairs[src]:
        if (src, dst) in cycle_edges:
            g.edge(src, dst, color = 'blue')
        else:
            g.edge(src, dst)</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/04/17/its-all-greek-to-me/greek-to-me-color.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/04/17/its-all-greek-to-me/greek-to-me-color.png" /></a></p>
<p>So they're all in that pocket. If I had a few more minutes, I could show all of the cycles as different colors, but that gets complicated in that many re-use the same paths. So it goes.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>The first of the issues this raises I already mentioned in my review of <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/04/06/ender-in-exile">Ender in Exile</a>. When you write a series of books out of chronological order, it's extremely easy to contradict yourself. In this case, there was really one sticking point: gravity manipulation technology. In Ender's Game (let alone the sequels), it's made relatively clear that humanity only learned to manipulate gravity from the formics. But in the First Formic War, there are two different groups using gravity technology, one for mining (in a way that sounds an awful lot like the Little Doctor) and the other for propulsion.</p>
<p>Now, it's entirely possible to explain this away in universe as Ender just being too young or others not even knowing that this was the case--except Mazer Rackham was one of the pilots of the planes using the gravity manipulation technology. So...</p>
<p>Now that is off of my chest though, I actually greatly enjoyed the series. I like it when you have multiple completely different points of view or time in a shared universe, so that you can see how some difference play out. I also liked the aspect of the First Formic War taking place when humanity is just starting to expand out into the solar system, with a colonies on other rocks (the moon and asteroids at least) and even mining in the Kuiper Belt. It's a segment of science fiction that isn't that common, so it was nice to see it here.</p>
<p>Next, the characters. There was definiately some give and take here. I liked Victor and his family. I thought their family dynamic was interesting, even if it did edge into the 'children are far smarter than adults' trope that the Enderverse relies fairly heavily upon. One interesting contrast was a bit right at the beginning of the first book about relationships in a closely related, isolated population. It got just as preachy as Ender in Exile, but for whatever reason, I thought this time it was more deserved and done much better.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I wasn't overly thrilled with the character of Lem. I get that there are people that think that, that are so set in their world view and so sure that everyone is out to get them that they cannot see it any other way. I even get that those can make interesting characters in fiction. He just really grated on me. I wish there had been more growth and change for him.</p>
<p>Third and final, Mazer Rackham and the MOPs were interesting. There's certainly an undertone of military worship (but only 'smart' military worship) going on as many of the Enderverse books have, but I think I liked how it worked out here. What I didn't care for as much was how obvious (at least to me) many of their political maneuverings and military tactics were. Need to justify military action in China? Publicly thank a high powered general ahead of time so he cannot back down without looking a fool. Need some way to attack under the landers? Oh hey, we happen to have these drills...</p>
<p>All that said and done, it's not bad. I'm looking forward to if/when the detail the Second Formic War even more. For now though, I think I'm going to go ahead and take one final side trip (for now) and finish the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/43963">Ender Quintet</a> before getting back to my list with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12953520-year-zero">Year Zero</a>.

Unfortunately, over time there have been a number of attacks on RC4, both in poorly written protocols (such as in the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEP">WEP</a>) or statistical attacks against the protocol itself.</p>
<p>Still, for how well it formed, it's an amazingly simple algorithm, so I decided to try my hand at implementing it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Basically, RC4 is what is known as a '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stream_cipher">stream cipher</a>', implying that each byte in the input message is encrypted individually (generally taking into account feedback from previous bytes). This runs counter to the perhaps more well known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/block_ciphers">block ciphers</a> such as DES and AES, where bytes are instead encrypted together (although feedback between blocks is still of course possible).</p>
<p>The first step of the algorithm is to take your encryption key (a password or the like) and convert it into a sequence of bytes at least as long as your input. For RC4, this is done in two pieces. First, prepare the index:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def rc4(key, msg):
    S = list(range(256))

    j = 0
    for i in range(256):
        j = (j + S[i] + key[i % len(key)]) % 256
        S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]

    ...</code></pre>
<p>Or in Racket:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>(define (rc4 key msg)
  (define (mod256 n) (modulo n 256))

  (define permutation (make-bytes 256))
  (for ([i (in-range 256)])
    (bytes-set! permutation i i))

  (define (S i)
    (bytes-ref permutation i))

  (define (swap! i j)
    (let ([pi (bytes-ref permutation i)]
          [pj (bytes-ref permutation j)])
      (bytes-set! permutation i pj)
      (bytes-set! permutation j pi)))

  ; Key-scheduling algorithm
  (for/fold ([j 0]) ([i (in-range 256)])
    (let ([j (mod256 (+ j
                        (S i)
                        (bytes-ref key (modulo i (bytes-length key)))))])
      (swap! i j)
      j))

  ...)</code></pre>
<p>I made the Racket version a little more verbose with helper functions, since I know I'll both be indexing the permutation and swapping values again in the next step. That's one of the reasons that I'll sometimes go for Python over Racket in on off scripts.</p>
<p>Still, relatively simple in both cases.</p>
<p>The next step is to turn that into a stream, essentially creating an infinite number generator. Luckily, both Python and Racket have generators, which are perfectly suited for this sort of thing (assuming in both cases that <code>S</code> / <code>permutation</code> are in scope from above):</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def rc4(key, msg):
    ...

    def prga():
        i = j = 0
        while True:
            i = (i + 1) % 256
            j = (j + S[i]) % 256
            S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]
            yield S[(S[i] + S[j]) % 256]

    return prga # DEBUG</code></pre>
<pre class="racket"><code>(define (rc4 key msg)
  ...

  ; Pseudo-random generation algorithm
  (define prga
    (generator ()
      (let loop ([i 1] [j (S 1)])
        (swap! i j)
        (yield (S (mod256 (+ (S i) (S j)))))
        (loop (mod256 (+ i 1)) (mod256 (+ j (S (+ i 1))))))))

  prng) ; DEBUG</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have a stream, we can generate a few bytes and take a look if we wanted:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import binascii, itertools
&gt;&gt;&gt; prga = rc4(b'Secret', b'Attack at dawn')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(binascii.hexlify(bytes(itertools.islice(prga(), 10))))
b'04d46b053ca87b594172'</code></pre>
<pre class="racket"><code>(define (bytes-&gt;hex b*)
  (apply ~a (for/list ([b (in-bytes b*)])
        (~a (number-&gt;string (quotient b 16) 16)
            (number-&gt;string (modulo b 16) 16)))))

&gt; (define prga (rc4 "Secret" "Attack at dawn"))
&gt; (bytes-&gt;hex (apply bytes (for/list ([i (in-range 10)] [b (in-producer prga)]) b)))
"04d46b053ca87b594172"</code></pre>
<p>Both of them the same? Good sign. Both matching the example on the Wikipedia page? Even better!</p>
<p>So, we have an infinite stream of bytes. What next?</p>
<p>Well, this is actually the crazy part: You just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xor">xor</a> them.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def rc4(key, msg):
    ...

    return bytes(msgbyte ^ keybyte for msgbyte, keybyte in zip(msg, prga()))</code></pre>
<pre class="racket"><code>(define (rc4 key msg)
  ...

  ; Encryption
  (apply bytes
    (for/list ([input-byte (in-bytes msg)] [key-byte (in-producer prga)])
      (bitwise-xor input-byte key-byte))))</code></pre>
<p>And now we can encrypt!</p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(binascii.hexlify(rc4(b'Secret', b'Attack at dawn')))
b'45a01f645fc35b383552544b9bf5'</code></pre>
<pre class="racket"><code>&gt; (bytes-&gt;hex (rc4 "Secret" "Attack at dawn"))
"45a01f645fc35b383552544b9bf5"</code></pre>
<p>And decrypt!</p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; rc4(b'Secret', rc4(b'Secret', b'Attack at dawn'))
b'Attack at dawn'</code></pre>

<p>Very cool. I'm really starting to see the appeal of RC4. A couple dozen lines of Python/Racket and you're encrypting. Bam. As mentioned, it's not really an algorithm you should use in encryption any more (the author has released a slightly more complicated algorithm called Spritz that works very similarly).</p>
<p>And that's it. If you'd like to see the entire code in one place (along with some fiddling in both cases to deal with Unicode keys/messages as well as pure bytes), it's on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/small-projects/blob/master/blog/rc4.py">rc4.py</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/small-projects/blob/master/blog/rc4.rkt">rc4.rkt</a>.</p>
