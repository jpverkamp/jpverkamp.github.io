<p>Coming on the heels of the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> public beta, you might think I'm using that. If I were running this blog on my own servers, I probably would be. But since I'm actually (for the moment) using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>, that's not actually the case. I'm actually using <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare's</a> free<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span> tier.</p>
<p>Basically, here is my tech stack:</p>
<p>Source files are written in Markdown(ish) stored in a GitHub git repo: <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/blog">github:jpverkamp/blog</a></p>
<p>Source files are translated into static HTML via my custom blog generator: <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/blog-generator">github:jpverkamp/blog-generator</a><span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></span></li></p>
<p>Files are deployed to a GitHub pages repo: <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/jpverkamp.github.io">github:jpverkamp/jpverkamp.github.io</a>, which you used to be able to directly access in the browser at <a href="http://jpverkamp.github.io">jpverkamp.github.io</a><span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>CloudFlare handles my DNS, with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME">CNAME</a> directing <code>blog.jverkamp.com</code> to <code>jpverkamp.github.io</code>:</p>
<p><a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/07/free-https-blog-hosting-via-github-and-cloudflare/cloudflare-options.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/07/free-https-blog-hosting-via-github-and-cloudflare/cloudflare-options.png" /></a></p>
<p>A custom Page Rule tells CloudFlare to automatically redirect incoming HTTP traffic to HTTPS:</p>

<p>In order to ease this transaction, I changed my config file so that all internal links to my own blog now use a relative protocol: <code>//blog.jverkamp.com</code></p>
<p>And... that's it.</p>
<p>I only had one hiccup transferring my DNS entries to CloudFlare (it missed email records on a subdomain), but other than that it was rather easy to set up.</p>
<p>If you haven't given it a try, check it out! Between CloudFlare and now Let's Encrypt, there's really no good reason you shouldn't be encrypting just about everything.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Advent of Code: Day 7</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/07/advent-of-code-day-7" /><id>urn:uuid:43df33f1-13b4-5b4b-cbce-a7118aadaadd</id><updated>2015-12-07T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/7">Source</a></p>

<p>This one is actually really cool. It's basically a full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declarative_programming language">declarative programming language</a>.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>monops = {
    'NOT': lambda x : ~x & 0xFFFF,
}

binops = {
    'AND': operator.and_,
    'OR': operator.or_,
    'LSHIFT': operator.lshift,

machine = {}

for line in sys.stdin:
    line = line.strip()

    m = (
        re.match(r'(\w+) -&gt; (\w+)', line)
        or re.match(r'(\w+) (\w+) (\w+) -&gt; (\w+)', line)
        or re.match(r'(\w+) (\w+) -&gt; (\w+)', line)
    ).groups()

    machine[m[-1]] = m[:-1]

def evaluate(register_or_value):
    try:
        return int(register_or_value)
    except:
        return run(register_or_value)

def run(register, state = {}):
    if not register in state:
        command = machine[register]

        if len(command) == 1:
            value, = command
            state[register] = evaluate(value)

        elif len(command) == 2:
            monop, input = command
            state[register] = monops[monop](evaluate(input))

        elif len(command) == 3:
            input_1, binop, input_2 = command
            state[register] = binops[binop](evaluate(input_1), evaluate(input_2))

    return state[register]

print(run('a'))</code></pre>
<p>Basically, we have two interesting functions: <code>evaluate</code> and <code>run</code>. Each of those will be applied to any parameters. <code>evaulate</code> will check first if the parameter is an integer, if so return it directly. If not, fall back to <code>run</code>, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memoized">memoized</a> virtual machine.</p>
<p>If we have the values of any inputs (either because they are numeric or because we've already calculated them), it will directly calculate the value for that gate and cache it. If not, it will calculate any recursive outputs it needs (caching them as well), and then calculate it's own. Through the power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a>, this will naturally resolve the order the gates need to be run in while still running in <code>O(n)</code> time to the number of gates. Very cool, in my opinion<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>The only other oddity is the definition of <code>NOT</code>. Since Python integers are not 16-bits, doing a bitwise and with <code>0xFFFF</code> (the maximum 16-bit value) will lock the result into that range.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Take the value of <code>a</code> after running part 1 and assign it to <code>b</code>. Run the simulation again.</p>
<p>Due to how I load in the instructions, this is as easy as adding a line of the form <code>14710 -> b</code> to the end of my input before running it. That will replace the previous command for <code>b</code>. You can do it in a <a href="http://www.zsh.org/"><code>zsh</code></a> one liner<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a></sup></span> shells would work just as well}:</p>

<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> Given a 1000 by 1000 grid of lights and a list of instructions of the form <code>(turn on|turn off|toggle) 5,10 through 15,20</code>, determine how many lights are on.</p>
<!--more-->
<pre class="python"><code>lights = [
    [False for y in range(1000)]
    for x in range(1000)
]

for line in sys.stdin:
    mode, x1, y1, x2, y2 = re.match('(.*) (\d+),(\d+) through (\d+),(\d+)', line.strip()).groups()
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, (x1, y1, x2, y2))

                lights[x][y] = not lights[x][y]

print(sum(
    1 if lights[x][y] else 0
    for x in range(1000)
    for y in range(1000)
))</code></pre>
<p>At first, I was going to use <a href="http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/">pyparsing</a> to parse the input, but then I decided that it was far too heavy weight for what I was doing. All I needed was regular expressions. After that, it's just a matter of creating a relatively large two dimensional array and running each instruction.</p>
<p>This one I actually did twice. I was curious if CPU would be significantly faster than memory (it is) to the extent that it would be faster to just calculate each light as we went:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>filters = []
for line in sys.stdin:
    m = re.match('(.*) (\d+),(\d+) through (\d+),(\d+)', line.strip())
    filters.append([m.group(1)] + list(map(int, m.groups()[1:])))

def is_on(x, y):
    on = False
    for mode, x1, y1, x2, y2 in filters:
        if x1 &lt;= x &lt;= x2 and y1 &lt;= y &lt;= y2:
            if mode == 'turn on':
                on = True
            elif mode == 'turn off':
                on = False
            else:
                on = not on
    return on

print(sum(
    1 if is_on(x, y) else 0
    for x in range(1000)
    for y in range(1000)
))</code></pre>
<p>I works at least, giving the same answer, but it's roughly an order of magnitude slower. So it goes.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> This time <code>turn on</code> is <code>+1</code>, <code>turn off</code> is <code>-1</code>, <code>toggle</code> is <code>+2</code> and you cannot go below zero for any single cell.</p>
<p>The code doesn't actually change much from the first solution to the first part, we just initialize to <code>0</code> instead of <code>False</code> and tweak the updates. The only interesting one is the <code>turn off</code> case:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>elif mode == 'turn off':
    if lights[x][y] &gt; 0:
        lights[x][y] -= 1</code></pre>
<p>Since this is the only case that can be negative, it's the only one we have to special case.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Powder Mage Trilogy</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/powder-mage-trilogy" /><id>urn:uuid:1e22dce1-ebc3-45ce-27fe-5c3ad545ecb7</id><updated>2015-12-05T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790883-promise-of-blood"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/powder-mage-trilogy/1-promise-of-blood.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17608111-the-crimson-campaign"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/powder-mage-trilogy/2-crimson-campaign.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20883847-the-autumn-republic"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/powder-mage-trilogy/3-autumn-republic.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Disclaimer: When I first read Promise of Blood, I was reading it one chapter per day (discussing each over email as we went). Given the number of characters and initially disparate plot lines, this was probably not the best way to read this series. After reading the second two straight through in a single sitting or four, I actually went back and upped my rating for the first book. I almost want to go back and re-read it properly, but I doubt I'll do so.</p>
<p>Individual reviews (minor spoilers):</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790883-promise-of-blood"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/powder-mage-trilogy/1-promise-of-blood.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure what to think about this book.</p>
<p>On one hand, there are several varied magic systems in this book. You have the Privileged, the Marked, and the Knacked.</p>
<p>The Marked, also known as Powder Mages, are what I would have thought of as the core of the book, with the ability to basically control gun powder in various ways and to snort it as a drug, increasing their physical abilities. Side note though: It's weird that they're interchangeably called Marked and Powder Mages throughout the book. It took me more than a while to realize those two were the same thing.</p>
<p>The Privileged are more traditional fireball, lightning bolt sort of mages and, honestly, are more interesting. Which, for a series named after the Powder Mages, is a bit weird.</p>
<p>The Knacked are a fairly unique idea in that their magic is basically limited use super powers--the ability to go without sleep, for example, or a perfect memory. It's a neat idea, but I think it would be even better if it were the only magic system in the world. On top of the other two, it just seems ... busy.</p>
<p>So far as the actual story goes, you kick off the book with a bloody revolution: overthrowing and killing the king, along with much of the court, and all of the Privileged in the city. That's certainly a powerful start, and the rest of the book deals with the aftermath of such an event. I wish it had been a bit more focused though. The book jumps from scene to scene and viewpoint to viewpoint, sometimes skipping days or more in between. It's jarring and sometimes hard to follow.</p>
<p>Mostly related, I wish that there was a little more depth to the characters. You basically had Tamas the Angry, Taniel the Druggie, Adamat the Investigator, and Ka-poel the Voodoo Sidekick. I do like Adamat at least. Maybe the entire book should have been from his point of view? (Side note: Having Tamas and Taniel, both Powder Mages, be father and son was confusing. Their names are too similar. I kept getting them confused.)</p>
<p>And then the ending. So many things all come to a head all at once... and then it's over. A single shot and then we're in the Epilogue. It was surprising to say the least. I guess the sequels will deal with the fallout of those last few chapters, but honestly I'm not sure if this book caught me enough to convince me to read the sequels.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17608111-the-crimson-campaign"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/powder-mage-trilogy/2-crimson-campaign.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I think the main reason that I had some problems following all of the different storylines in the first Powder Mage book was that I was reading one chapter per day and discussion as I went. Reading straight through the second book helped keep everything together. It also helps that there are few to no new major characters.</p>
<p>Overall, this was very much the second book in a trilogy. It picks up where the first left off and sets up the third. It probably wouldn't stand particularly well alone, but then again it doesn't have to. It's pretty much action all of the way through, tying up various plot lines just to ramp things up even more.</p>
<p>The general world building continues to feel something like a kitchen sink, with at least four different fairly vague magic systems all interacting in odd ways. Ka-poel is even more a singleton that everyone (even the 'gods') underestimates. I'm still not sure exactly what she did to Taniel (if it was in fact her), but I am curious how that particularly bit will end.</p>
<p>I think Taniel had the strongest story of the book, growing and changing the most of any of the characters. He's still insufferable at times, but he's also interesting. Adamat got pushed to the edge and breaks things (and people) to get his family back. It's obvious, but it's still a solid storyline (and I'm glad it ended up as relatively well as it has for him).  Tamas' storyline behind enemy lines was interesting enough, but I want to see him back with the others again.</p>
<p>And ... cliffhangers. I cannot stop now, which is of course the point. But now I'm actually looking forward to what's next.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20883847-the-autumn-republic"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/05/powder-mage-trilogy/3-autumn-republic.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>A solid conclusion. Basically, The Autumn Republic builds on the world of the first two books, without really needing to introduce much in the way of new characters (with a few relatively minor exceptions) or new world building, instead taking everything to a final conclusion.</p>
<p>So far as the characters go, I really found myself rooting for the good guys and hoping they would save the day, even when they did some not entirely unobjectionable things. In particular, I'm glad that Adamat's story at least didn't get any worse and that he managed to survive (spoilers) all the crap that the Marked and Privileged put him through.</p>
<p>So far as the world building goes, I still think that there were too many different magic systems floating around (especially when you take into account various power levels), but I think we finally got a bit more insight into some of the inner workings at least of the powder mages and Privileged which was nice. I'm vaguely annoyed that we didn't get any more about Ka-Poel or Nila, given that this is the last in the series. So it goes.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, worth the read. McClellan goes on my list of authors to watch.</p>
<p>Next up, I'm going to step away from my <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a> for a moment, since I have a book club meeting coming up and instead read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15819028-the-golem-and-the-jinni">The Golem and the Jinni</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6466778.Helene_Wecker">Helene Wecker</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7163862-zoo-city">Zoo City</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/426034.Lauren_Beukes">Lauren Beukes</a>.</p>
<p>After that, I should be back on track for my final (planned) series of the year: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40853-necroscope">Necroscope</a> (15 books!).</p>

In this case, <code>.*([aeiou].*){3}</code> says to match a vowel <code>[aeiou]</code> followed by any number (including zero) three times. <code>(.)\1</code> says to match any one character, then match that same character again (<code>\1</code> refers to the first matched group in parenthesis). <code>(ab|cd|pq|xy)</code> matches any one of the verboten sequences and then we negate it with <code>not</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> A 'nice' string now contains a pair of letters appearing twice in a string (such as <code>xy</code> in <code>axybcxydef</code>) and one pattern of the form <code>xyx</code> (with the first and third letters the same).</p>
<p>The code is the same, just change the regular expressions to two new patterns, each with a back reference:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>re.search(r'(..).*\1', word)
and re.search(r'(.).\1', word)</code></pre>
<p>The first matches any two characters followed by any number (including zero) uninteresting characters, followed by that same first two characters. The second does the same, only with a single character repeated group and exactly one random character in between.</p>

<p><code>naturals</code> is code that I've used on a number of previous occasions and basically <del>stole</del> borrowed from Racket's <code><a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/search/index.html?q=n-naturals">n-naturals</a></code>. It allows you to iterate indefinitely over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural_numbers">natural numbers</a>. Then, just hash and look for enough leading zeros.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Do the same thing, only with six leading zeros.</p>
<p>Nothing changes; just change the <code>length</code> parameter and wait a bit longer. Moderns computers can still crunch through a whole heck of a lot of hashes (9958218 for my particular input) in next to no time at all.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Advent of Code: Day 3</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/03/advent-of-code-day-3" /><id>urn:uuid:68885146-6356-7c02-ec5c-5f0fbb4bf956</id><updated>2015-12-03T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/3">Source</a></p>
<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> Given a string of <code><>^v</code> characters which mean move west, east, north, or south respectively and starting at the origin, how many unique positions do you pass through?</p>
<pre class="python"><code>presents = collections.defaultdict(lambda : 0)

<p>There are two tricks here, both of which I've used before. First, we have use <code>collections.defaultdict</code> to implement a basic counter. That way, we can safely do <code>+= 1</code> to any element without worrying if it exists first and without initializing the (potentially infinite) grid.</p>
<p>Second, we represent points using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/complex_numbers">complex numbers</a>. That has the advantage of meaning that movement is just adding two (complex) numbers together and we can directly index the <code>presents</code> dictionary with the locations.</p>
<p>At the end, the <code>len</code> of a dictionary is the number of keys, thus exactly equal to the number of locations visited (which thankfully works correctly even with a <code>defaultdict</code>). Neat.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Start with two actors, each at the origin. Apply alternating characters to first one then the other, such that <code>^v^v</code> would result in one moving north twice, the other two south.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> A gift requires enough wrapping paper to cover the surface plus an additional amount equal to the area smallest side. Calculate the total wrapping paper needed for a list of dimensions of the form <code>2x3x4</code>.</p>
<!--more-->
<pre class="python"><code>total_area = 0

for line in sys.stdin:
    l, w, h = list(sorted(map(int, line.strip().split('x'))))
    area = 3 * l * w + 2 * w * h + 2 * h * l
    total_area += area

print(total_area)</code></pre>
<p>The only real trick here is the use of <code>list(sorted(...))</code>. This will guarantee that <code>l</code> and <code>w</code> are the smallest dimensions and thus represent the extra area to add.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Given the same input, calculate the amount of ribbon needed. You need the larger of either the shortest distance around the outside or the smallest perimeter of any one face. In addition, you need an additional amount equal to the volume in cubic feet.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>total_ribbon = 0

for line in sys.stdin:
    l, w, h = list(sorted(map(int, line.strip().split('x'))))

    total_ribbon += max(
        2 * (l + w), # smallest distance around sides
        4 * l,       # smallest perimeter
    )

    total_ribbon += l * w * h

print(total_ribbon)</code></pre>
<p>This one was a little stranger since the original description was unclear if you needed the larger or smaller of the first two measurements, but it was easy enough to calculate both. Turns out, they meant the larger of those two.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Glorious Gification of HipChat Rooms</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/02/glorious-gification-of-hipchat-rooms" /><id>urn:uuid:359d720d-d37a-ff8c-6784-f0cf5a724486</id><updated>2015-12-02T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To counter yesterday's post on <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/01/iterating-the-github-api">Iterating the GitHub API</a>, how about something a little more lighthearted today: GIFs<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p>

<p>Animated GIFs are an amusing--if arguably useful--way of communicating. But hey, if something is worth doing, it's worth OVERDOING, no<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span>?</p>
<p>So I wrote a script to upload my entire collection of GIFs to a HipChat room<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></span>:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
import random
import re
import requests
import sys
import time

ACCESS_TOKEN = '{redacted}'
ROOM_ID = 8675309
GIF_PATH = '{redacted}'
TIMEOUT = 60

from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.image import MIMEImage
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer {}'.format(ACCESS_TOKEN),
    'Accept-Charset': 'UTF-8',
    'Content-Type': 'multipart/related',
}

url = 'https://api.hipchat.com/v2/room/{}/share/file'.format(ROOM_ID)

paths = [
    os.path.join(path, file)
    for path, dirs, files in os.walk(GIF_PATH)
    for file in files
    if file.endswith('.gif')
]
random.shuffle(paths)

for path in paths:
    print(path)

    raw_body = MIMEMultipart('related')
    with open(path, 'rb') as fin:
        img = MIMEImage(fin.read())
        img.add_header(
            'Content-Disposition',
            'attachment',
            name = 'file',
            filename = path.split('/')[-1]
        )
        raw_body.attach(img)

    raw_headers, body = raw_body.as_string().split('\n\n', 1)
    boundary = re.search('boundary="([^"]*)"', raw_headers).group(1)

    headers['Content-Type'] = 'multipart/related; boundary="{}"'.format(boundary)

    r = requests.post(url, data = body, headers = headers)
    time.sleep(TIMEOUT)</code></pre>
<p>The main reason that this script is at all interesting is that the API excepts (and requires) a <code>multipart/related</code> request, but the <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">Requests</a> won't send one. So instead we have to pull in Python's email libraries in order to generate the request body. It's a bit annoying, but an interesting dive into some of the more esoteric details of web requests.</p>
<p>Also, I've been on a kick of using slightly more complicated list comprehension:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>paths = [
    os.path.join(path, file)
    for path, dirs, files in os.walk(GIF_PATH)
    for file in files
    if file.endswith('.gif')
]</code></pre>
<p>Basically, if you put multiple <code>for</code> loops in a list comprehension body, it will return a single iterable, nested from the first to the last. So this is equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>paths = []
for path, dirs, files in os.walk(GIF_PATH):
    for file in files:
        if file.endswith('.gif'):
            os.path.join(path, file)</code></pre>
<p>It's arguable which is more Pythonic (probably the latter), but I do find it interesting what impact writing piles of functional code (<a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/category/programming/by-language/racket">Racket</a>) will do to code in other languages.</p>
<p>And, that's it. Short and sweet. Use responsibly.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Advent of Code</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/01/advent-of-code" /><id>urn:uuid:5f4c0cf6-ad53-c952-fd22-723d73c08e90</id><updated>2015-12-01T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm always on the lookout for new sources of quick<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span> coding puzzles.
