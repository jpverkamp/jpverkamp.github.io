<p>The man that gave me the box wasn't a very good man. He was tall and skinny and he smelled. But he gave me a shiny silver penny and said that if I took this box to the other end of the market and came back, he could would give me another.</p>
<p>Two shiny silver pennies?</p>
<p>All for taking a stupid little box across the street.</p>
<p>The market is busy. Busy means pockets and pockets mean pennies and pennies mean dinner.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>But if I don't hafta steal to get dinner, then that's okay too. People don't come after you if you don't steal so much.</p>
<p>No one looks at me. It's like they don't even see me, even though I'm the tallest of Talitha's crew. Well, except for Talitha herself. But she's old. 20 years at least, that's ancient.</p>
<p>Halfway across the square, there's a ruckus. One of those metal men has fallen down and lost his head.</p>
<p>I stop and laugh, but only for a moment.</p>
<p>It's not polite to laugh at stranger's misfortune. And you have to be polite not to get caught. Talitha says.</p>
<p>But it's funny. The metal men are everywhere now. Not like it used to be. Back when I was still small. Back then, the metal men were only in the rich parts of town.</p>
<p>The metal men are no fun. No pockets. No purses. No pennies.</p>
<p>The metal man isn't interesting though. He just lays there. He has a box too. It looks like my box. But the smelly man didn't say that there would be any other boxes.</p>
<p>Would would a metal man want with a penny anyway?</p>
<p>I start walking again. I really wanted to get the silver penny that the smelly man had already given me out of my pocket. There were things you could only do with the lighter silver pennies.</p>
<p>But then the other boys would see. They might come and take my penny away. Talitha wouldn't be happy then; she said that if I got beat up again, that was it. I was done.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what exactly I would be done with, but it didn't sound good.</p>
<p>I liked my job.</p>
<p>I started again, only to feel a sudden pain in my foot. I'd kicked something.</p>
<p>I looked down and jumped up, all at the same time.</p>
<p>The thing I kicked? It was the metal man's head.</p>
<p>How did that get over here?</p>
<p>It was staring at me with those gemstone eyes. They weren't right though. Normally those eyes never stop moving. The metal men don't have to eat, they don't have to sleep. They cut right into our pickpocketing they did when they started policing the market.</p>
<p>But this one didn't seem much interested in me. All laying there, a head without a body, it didn't seem to be reacting at all.</p>
<p>Was the metal man dead?</p>
<p>I never really thought about that. If they moved around and walked and talked, I guess that meant they were alive. And if they were alive, well then I guess this one could just possibly be dead.</p>
<p>So he won't be needing those eyes.</p>
<p>I took it.</p>
<p>The head I mean.</p>
<p>It was heavier than I expected.</p>
<p>It mean, it was metal, right? But it was heavier than my own head. And the metal men never seemed to mind. And it was shiny.</p>
<p>It wasn't too bad.</p>
<p>I could do this.</p>
<p>Luckily, no one seemed to notice that I'd taken it. In fact, they all seemed to be very careful not to notice anything that was going on.</p>
<p>People don't notice things they don't want to. Talitha always said that.</p>
<p>The rest of the way, there were other metal men. They weren't helping the one that broke. I guess the metal men are just like people after all.</p>
<p>There was a fire at the end of the market. I left the box by the fire.</p>
<p>There was another box, just like mine.</p>
<p>Two shiny silver pennies for them, two shiny silver pennies for me.</p>
<p>They don't have a shiny metal head though.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Writing Excuses prompt: Walking through a scene (Part 1)</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/04/writing-excuses-prompt-walking-through-a-scene-part-1" /><id>urn:uuid:4f19d08b-7c08-c4a3-f44f-90d04df15921</id><updated>2015-09-04T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I didn't last nearly as long as I'd hoped with the <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/writing/writing-excuses">Writing Excuses</a> prompts.

<hr />
<p>There are certain advantages that come with being dead. When walking down the street, people tend to give you a wide berth.</p>
<p>People don't want to be reminded of their own mortality.</p>
<p>People don't want to be reminded that death is no longer the end.</p>
<p>My target was on the other end of the marketplace, on the front steps of the temple to Acbris, God of the Sun. Ironic, all things considered.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I was to take my package--a small thing, wrapped in brown paper--and leave it around the massive brazier that was never allowed to go out. To the casual observer, it would seem an offering like any other. Something to be tossed in by the temple priests whenever the fires began to dim even slightly.</p>
<p>At first, I had worried about that. If the package wasn't picked up in time, would it not be thrown into the flames? What good would that do anyone?</p>
<p>But it didn't matter. I was being paid handsomely for no more than a half hour's walk across the market place. The price was more than enough to account for the stares.</p>
<p>Lost in my thoughts, I had no time to respond when the cart came barreling out of an alleyway directly into my path. It was huge, pulled by a team of four mechanical horses, two by two, each snorting and steaming as they reared up in a vain attempt to slow themselves.</p>
<p>The horses smashed into me, the first two knocking me to the ground, and the next two crushing my steel chest. If I had still been alive, that would have killed me. But instead, it didn't even hurt. I could no longer feel pain. Finally, the cart hit me. I felt the impact, although if that was a true response or a memory of what I had once been, I couldn't say.</p>
<p>I saw my chest bending, a long dent running from side to side. I heard a scream of steel as it bent, further and further. Something had to give, and give it did. Unfortunately, the part that gave was my head.</p>
<p>There was a hiss of steam as my head popped off and went rolling across the street. A spray of tiny golden gears spilled out from my neck.</p>
<p>For several long moments, I just lay there.</p>
<p>It had been such a simple job. Just walk across the market and drop off the package. Now I couldn't even tell for sure where the package was, let alone finish the job.</p>
<p>I felt the crystal core, deep in my chest, just as it always was. A miracle of science and magic both, the crystalline structure was exactly how I was able to bind my spirit--all that was left of who I had once been--to the golem's body. I couldn't begin to explain how it worked.</p>
<p>While I lay there, trying to figure out what to do next, a small child walked up to me. In a single quick motion, he bent down and stole my head.</p>
<p>I couldn't believe it. When I first saw the little street rat, I felt bad for him. The city had a problem with orphans, everyone knew that. What circumstances had led him to a life on the street?</p>
<p>When he'd stopped, I sorely wished I still had the ability to speak. But that was one of the conditions of my resurrection. It wasn't that they <em>coudn't</em> give golems a voice--but rather that the guild didn't trust us not to tell anyone exactly what we were. Even with the Geas, they didn't trust us not to go back to our former families and spill their one great secret.</p>
<p>Then he reached down for my head and I thought I wouldn't have to. That he would do the right thing.</p>
<p><em>Just put it back in place,</em> I mentally ordered.</p>
<p>But the little jerk just took it and ran.</p>
<p>I lay there, dumbfounded, for what felt like ages.</p>
<p>I couldn't really blame him. Not really. He was probably starving. Living on the street. I'm sure he didn't have any family or probably even a home to go back to. It was one of the problems that had gotten significantly worse since The Baron had come to power. That and the armies of new golems being pressed into service. I was one of them.</p>
<p>A detail flashed into my mind. In the confusion of losing my head, I missed it at first.</p>
<p>The boy had been carrying a package.</p>
<p>One that looked an awful lot like my own.</p>
<p>I turned within my golem shell, trying to find my own package. It took a moment, but I found it, only a hair away from my outstretched hand.</p>
<p>Well, that was something at least.</p>
<p>With a mental sigh--I no longer possessed either the lungs or the mouth for anything more--I heaved myself to my feet, package in hand. It was an unusual feeling. My body felt off balance and one arm and leg were not quite working correctly. But I could get to my feet and that was enough. If I even hoped to be able to afford a new head, I needed to deliver that package.</p>
<p>One step.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>My left leg was no longer bending at the knee and the right was rattling. When all was said and done, I was going to need more than just a new head.</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>Four.</p>
<p>The others in the square gave me an even wider burden. I was no longer merely a shade, but now a headless golem as well. Even if one understood in their mind that a golem did not need a head to function, it was still an unsettling sight.</p>
<p>Five.</p>
<p>Six.</p>
<p>I settled into the new rhythm. Right leg rattles, left leg drags. Right leg rattles...</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was there.</p>
<p>The fires at the temple to Acbris. And lying just beside the fire, two identical packages to the one I held in one hand.</p>
<p>I watched them for a moment. Not only the boy, but a third courier as well? Someone really wanted this package delivered.</p>
<p>But that was not my concern.</p>
<p>I had done my job. Now I could return to my berth and salvage what I could of my arms and legs. With any luck, this one delivery wouldn't send me even further into debt.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Using a Microsoft keyboard with a Mac</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/03/using-a-microsoft-keyboard-with-a-mac" /><id>urn:uuid:fdb332af-f326-0e82-0f0d-112e98e90ed9</id><updated>2015-09-03T14:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I use a MacBook at work.

So instead, I've been using a <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Microsoft-Natural-Ergonomic-Keyboard-4000/dp/B000A6PPOK/">Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard</a>. Then though, you have the difference between Control/Windows/Alt keys and Control/Option/Command.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First option, tweak the built in OS X keyboard settings:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/03/using-a-microsoft-keyboard-with-a-mac/keyboard-settings.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/03/using-a-microsoft-keyboard-with-a-mac/keyboard-settings.png" /></a></p>
<p>You have to make sure to choose the correct keyboard at the top, but once you have done so you can switch the Option and Command keys without problem (OS X thinks that Alt/Option is one key and the Windows key is Command). The downside to this solution is that every time you unplug the keyboard, the settings are removed. It looks like this has been a problem for <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2364069?threadID=2364069&tstart=0">a while...</a> So instead, we'll turn to third party tools.</p>
<p>Enter: <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">Karabiner</a>. So far as keyboard options, it has everything and the kitchen sink. There are <em>far</em> more options than the previous version (KeyRemap4MacBook). Long story short, these are the three options that I was looking for:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/03/using-a-microsoft-keyboard-with-a-mac/karabiner-settings.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/03/using-a-microsoft-keyboard-with-a-mac/karabiner-settings.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
    <li>Don't remap an internal keyboard - Change only the Microsoft keyboard, leave the Mac keyboard alone</li>
    <li>Command_L to Option_L (and vice versa) - swap the command and option keys (I never use the right side, although there are two more options to swap those)</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's it. It's been working great, persisting through reboot (you have to enable it in the Users &amp; Groups > Login Items settings page) and unplugging the keyboard. If only OS X had this functionality built in...</p>
<p>Bonus round:</p>
<p>I user a drop down terminal (<a href="http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/">TotalTerminal</a>) all of the time. It's great for productivity, since I switch between the console and applications all of the time. For the keyboard shortcut, I want to use the Caps Lock key (who actually uses that to write in all caps?). Unfortunately, you cannot use the Caps Lock key directly. Enter <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en">Seil</a>, a sibling application to Karabiner (although why they're not unified is unclear):</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/03/using-a-microsoft-keyboard-with-a-mac/seil-settings.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/03/using-a-microsoft-keyboard-with-a-mac/seil-settings.png" /></a></p>
<p>Change that one option (80 is F19, a key unlikely to be used by anything else; there's a list further down) and you're golden.</p>
<p>Edit: Ah ha. What I really wanted was to map my terminal to Caps Lock + A (so that I can use other keys for other applications in the future). I can map Caps Lock to Control, Option, or Command, so I have a few options:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Control-A: Suboptimal, since Control-A is already used to go to the beginning of the line</li>
    <li>Option-A: Since I'm remapping Option/Command, this will behave differently on the internal and external keyboard</li>
    <li>Command-A: Used to select all text, so that doesn't work</li>
</ul>
<p>Not so great.</p>
<p>Luckily, we do have an option. Remember how I was only mapping the <em>left</em> Control and Options earlier? We can use the right side! If we tell Seil to map Caps Lock to 61 (Right Option) and tell TotalTerminal to open on Option+A, that will do exactly what I expect on both the internal and external keyboard.</p>
<p>Victory!</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>The Iron Wyrm Affair</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/01/the-iron-wyrm-affair" /><id>urn:uuid:d1140414-f3b3-8ae2-b3cf-4c60713d0392</id><updated>2015-09-01T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12899734-the-iron-wyrm-affair"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/09/01/the-iron-wyrm-affair/the-iron-wyrm-affair.jpg" /></a></p>

<!--more-->
<p>Main problems:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There are <em>Proper Nouns</em> all over the place, but they're only rarely explained until much later (if at all). Some books can get away with this. This one did not.
    <li>The POV jumps from character to character and in some cases it can take a while to figure out who in the world is talking.</li>
    <li>Bannon (main character) is crazy powerful. Again, sometimes you can have a story start with a very powerful protagonist and go from there, but more often than not it doesn't work out.</li>
    <li>Clare (apparently supposed to be a main character) never really feels like a main character. He's badly overshadowed by Bannon and one of her Shields, to the point where I'm not sure why the series isn't titled Bannon and Mikal.</li>
    <li>Holy purple prose Batman. The wording feels accurate for the period (so far as I know, which I don't), but the fact that I noticed enough to comment on it isn't great. Also Bannon mentions over and over again how unladylike she's being. We get it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upsides:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Some of the descriptions were very cool. Counter to the last point above, I really could see what was going on in some of the scenes. Not necessarily why it was happening and I'm sure I got some of the <em>Proper Nouns</em> wrong, but it was still solid.</li>
    <li>There is a lot of neat worldbuilding just beneath the surface. I wish it was more obvious, but it's always interesting to read alternate history at this level. I want to know how things changed! I want to know how things work! Usually that wanting will drive me kicking and screaming through a story (in the best way possible). It almost did this time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to the point I made a little while back for Whitechapel Gods and <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/25/his-majestys-dragon">His Majesty's Dragon</a>. I'm sure there are loads of people who love this kind of story. I'm not one of them.</p>

<p>Next up on my <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/42777-the-academy">The Academy</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/73812.Jack_McDevitt">Jack McDevitt</a>.</p>
<p>The Academy (it feels weird to call it that) takes place in a few century distant future where humanity has been to the stars and found them next to empty.

<p>Next up on my <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/42777-the-academy">The Academy</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/73812.Jack_McDevitt">Jack McDevitt</a>.</p>
<p>The Academy (it feels weird to call it that) takes place in a few century distant future where humanity has been to the stars and found them next to empty. There are hints at civilizations that have come before (a monument on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_(moon)">Iapetus</a> for example) and others still around, albeit not at our same technological level. There are terrible threats: truly giant clouds of gas that seem to have a thing for destroying cities in several of the novels and a planet about to fall into a gas giant in another.</p>

<p>Overall, it's pretty solid science fiction. It's a little weird reading them all in sequence, since they only roughly seem to relate to one another. Sometimes characters are shared (superluminal pilot Priscilla "Hutch" Hutchins is one; reporter/editor Gregory MacAllister is another) and it's definitely a shared universe, but there are some events which come up in one book and not again for several sequels (if at all). It's not <em>bad</em> per say, just odd.</p>
<p>I do really like the world (galaxy?) that McDevitt has built here. I want to believe that life is far more common than he paints it--as a wise man once said, 'life finds a way'--but if that's not the case, I can imagine things working out exactly like this.</p>
<p>One particularly interesting point is that faster than light travel in this universe is possible, but limited. It still takes weeks / months / longer to get to other stars--which can be something of a problem if you happen to need rescuing. It's a perfect example though of just how <em>big</em> space is.</p>
<p>Also interesting (although I don't think I mention it in the individual reviews below) is the use of AI throughout the series. Each superluminal has an AI (although the Academy's seem to all be copies of a single AI named Bill) with a personality all its own. Yet they're just part of the world; for the most part people just interact with them as people. It's a neat idea and I like how it fits so seamlessly into the world.</p>
<p>That being said, here are my individual reviews:</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/337048.The_Engines_of_God"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/1-the-engines-of-god.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The Engines of God fits into the same rough style of science fiction as Rama, where the story is drive more by events and discovery than particularly by plot or character. In my opinion, this can be a perfectly enjoyable form of story, just so long as you know that's what you're getting.</p>
<p>The basic idea of this story is that in the future, humanity has developed faster than light travel and expanded to other solar systems. We've found one other current civilization (roughly WWI era; they haven't noticed us) and hints of others stretching back tens of thousands of years. Yet there's something strange: every one of them has sharp discontinuities where the clock of technology is reset.</p>
<p>One downside to this style and for this story in particular is that we only find out roughly what happened to those civilizations in the last 10% or so of the book. As an effect, the climax of the story felt rushed, with no earl impact. I know this is the first of a series and I can only hope they explore the impact of what they found a little more.</p>
<p>So far as characters, this was another weaker part of the story. I honestly don't think I could tell you anything about any of the characters I just read about (except maybe Hutch). Part of that is me--I'm not great with remembering details about people--and part is the same type-of-story thing mentioned above. Still, it's a little weird.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a neat story and in a style I enjoy reading (once I figured out that was what was going on). It was more than good enough to start in on the rest of the series. I really do want to figure out what is going on there.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/352780.Deepsix"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/2-deepsix.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Similar to the Engines of God a large chunk of the book is spent on the technology / archaeological aspects and how they interact with the story, but in this case there's also a strong thriller aspect. Things just keep going wrong (although, given that it's a novel, you can almost guess how each thing is going to go) over and over up until the climax.</p>
<p>The last section in particular was intense; I read the entire thing in one sitting--a literal page turner.</p>
<p>I liked the main characters well enough, at least as they were written. This time around, I could actually start to tell them apart, which is an upside. There are at least two who are curiously misogynistic for no reason that I could tell...</p>
<p>On a downside, we really didn't learn anything more about the Omega Waves from the previous book. And now we have some mysterious aliens who were about with advanced technology on a few thousand years ago... Perhaps we'll run into them in one of the sequels? One can hope.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382161.Chindi"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/3-chindi.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Chindi continues the trend of the previous two books in only vaguely being a sequel. It takes place after the previous two with one of the same characters (Hutch) and there are a few references to previous events... But that's about it. That's not a bad thing though.</p>
<p>This book starts with the discovery of an alien satellites around a neutron star. Hijinks ensue and people die (I'll come back to that in a second). It turns out that the satellites are part of a communication network. The next large chunk of the book follows our characters from world to world chasing after this network. (More people die). They finally end up finding a truly massive alien starship and exploring that (more people die). Then there's the climax where--just like Deepsix--our heroes have to attempt a daring / insane rescue mission so as not to leave a man behind.</p>
<p>On the plus side: I love the science aspects of the book. It's really starting to come together as a world and I like how there is some thought put into consequences. FTL travel and communication are possible, but it still takes time. Artificial gravity interacts oddly with inertia. Traveling at relativistic speeds does strange things to time. I keep turning pages, wanting to know more.</p>
<p>On the down side: It's getting increasingly hard to have sympathy for the characters. Over three books, there has been a fairly impressive body count. And almost all of them were avoidable. Over and over in this book, the author hangs a lampshade on the fact that what the characters are doing is dangerous. Off they go, and off someone dies. And yet other than a few token comments, no one seems to care. It's starting to get a bit weird.</p>
<p>Overall (and you can see by my rating), I'm still really enjoying this series. There's a definite sense of something building and the world growing and changing behind the scenes. And better, the epilogue of this book and the title of the next hint that we might just learn a bit more about the Omega Clouds from book 1! Looking forward to it.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/352781.Omega"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/4-omega.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Omega continues on in much the same vein as the previous Academy books. Science fiction in a universe where life is remarkably rare and civilization even more so. This time though... we've found someone.</p>
<p>The Omegas (clouds coming in 8000 year waves from the center of the galaxy which have a tendency to seek out and destroy right angles) return in the book, pointing directly to a new civilization. It's thousands of light years away, so there are only a limited number of ships that can possibly get there in time.</p>
<p>Hutch takes more of a backseat role this time, opening the stage to a few new characters. And just when I was finally getting to know her too. I like the new characters well enough and the death toll is at least lower this time. We'll see if they stick around in the next two books.</p>
<p>Overall, despite an entire civilization at stake, this book someone doesn't quite get as intense as those before it. Perhaps just because I've now read five of these in a row, but I can see from the outset which solutions are going to fail, which will partially succeed, and how they're finally going to save the day. It's not a problem per say, but it's getting there.</p>
<p>Final oddity (and this might have had some impact on the previous paragraph): I've actually read this book before. I'm fairly impressed that I managed to pick up and read the fourth in a series without realizing it (even if this is one series where that's not necessarily a problem) and that I didn't notice I was rereading until about 20% of the way into the book. It must have been pre-GoodReads that I last read it. Amusing.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/352775.Odyssey"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/5-odyssey.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Summary: The Academy is running out of money. In the meantime, MacAllister, a senator's daughter, a pilot, and a PR guy from the Academy are on a tour looking for UFOs because reasons. Eventually the find some (ish), the daughter gets contacted by aliens (maybe, no one believes her at first and it's never really explained), and a bunch of people die.</p>
<p>As with a few other books in this series, it takes half the book to get to what feels like the main plot point, with a massive acceleration in the last 15% and a final climax in the last 5%. It's not necessarily a bad thing, it just felt a lot more obvious in this book.</p>
<p>Especially when half the book it feels like is spent talking about how the Academy isn't getting funded any more (mirroring NASA and other modern day space programs) and an oddly large amount of the second half on a trial about a guy who went to a religious school, grew up, and punched a priest. I still haven't figured out where that came from.</p>
<p>That being said, I still enjoy the universe that McDevitt has built here. The universe actually feels big and the technology feels right. I want to believe that life will be more common than he paints it, but if it's not, this feels like how the universe might just be.</p>
<p>Once again, I hope the next book has a few more answers (we still don't know what the Omegas are and now there's a real current alien race?), but given the previous four and that #6 is the last book currently out... We'll see.</p>
<p>Edited to add: The book opens with a ship 'lost' in space because it didn't go nearly as far as it should have, despite the physicists saying that shouldn't be possible. Yet that particular weirdness is dropped and never mentioned again in favor of the 'retire the old ships because funding plot'. Weird.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/535318.Cauldron"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/08/27/the-academy/6-cauldron.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Following from Omega, the Academy is basically dead (lack of funding / interest) and humanity is withdrawing from the stars. Then there's a breakthrough in new FTL drive technology orders of magnitude faster than the previous incarnations. Hutch returns as one of the two pilots sent out on a high speed mission to the origin of the Chindi, a world SETI received a transmission came from, a black hole, and the possible origin of the Omegas (finally).</p>
<p>On the upside: we finally got something in the way of answers for both where the Chindi and the Omegas came from. It's by no means a complete answer, but more than we've had thus far. I'll take it. The addition of the new drive technology promises to really shake things up. I hope this isn't the last book in the series--I want to see where this universe goes, now that you can fly to the galactic core in about four months... (As an aside, space is *huge*).</p>
<p>On a slight downside, some of the stops really felt undeveloped. What could have been an entire book earlier in the series was only a chapter or two. Even so, I think this book had the best flow of the six; I finished it in a day.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, solid science fiction. Compared to the two previous such series I've read this year, I'd put it well above <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/06/21/rama">Rama</a> (when taken as a whole) and just about even with <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2013/11/10/enders-game">Ender's Game</a>. That should give you a hint at how much I liked these books. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>

<p>Specifically, we're working under a few conditions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nodes<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span> will be represented by a lowercase letter <code>a</code> to <code>z</code> (there will never be more than 26 nodes)</li>
    <li>Edges are either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally at 45 degrees and will be represented by <code>|-/\</code></li>
    <li>All edges will have a node at each end</li>
    <li>Any two nodes have at most one edge between them</li>
    <li>If edges need to bend, a virtual node marked by a <code>#</code> will be inserted (see examples later)</li>
    <li>Edges can overlap; there will always be at least one directed edge adjacent to each node</li>
</ul>
<p>My general idea for a solution takes place in three parts:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Load the grid into a quickly accessible form</li>
    <li>From each node, try each of the 8 cardinal directions looking for an edge; on an edge follow it until you hit either:
        <ul>
            <li>Another node: record the edge</li>
            <li>A virtual node: recursively check that edge instead</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Print out the edges found above</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's do it. First, read in the edges:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>from collections import defaultdict as ddict

# Points will be stored as (row, col) tuples
# The grid is a mapping of points to the character in that location
# Nodes nodes store their point for fast iteration
# The final solution will be a mapping of nodes to a set of other nodes adjacent to them
grid = ddict(lambda : ' ')
nodes = {}
adjacency = ddict(set)

# Read the rest of the grid
for row, line in enumerate(sys.stdin):
    for col, char in enumerate(line):

        pt = (row, col)
        grid[pt] = char

        if is_node(char):
            nodes[char] = (row, col)</code></pre>
<p>Straight forward. I love <code>defaultdict</code>, since it means we don't have to worry about looking for points off the edge of the grid. If it's out of bounds, it will just return empty space.</p>
<p>Next, the 'seeking' function, that will follow an edge until a node (either real or virtual):</p>
<pre class="python"><code># List of possible edges, ordered row, col, edge type
possible_edges = (
    (-1, -1, '\\'), (-1, 0, '|'), (-1, 1, '/'),
    ( 0, -1, '-'),                ( 0, 1, '-'),
    ( 1, -1, '/'),  ( 1, 0, '|'), ( 1, 1, '\\')
)

def neighbors(src_pt, previous_deltas = None):
    '''Given a point, yield any neighboring nodes'''

    src = grid[src_pt]
    row, col = src_pt

    for row_delta, col_delta, edge_type in possible_edges:

        dst_pt = (row + row_delta, col + col_delta)
        dst = grid[dst_pt]

        # Don't go back the way we came
        if (-row_delta, -col_delta) == previous_deltas:
            continue

        # A valid leaving edge, follow it until a node or a #
        elif dst == edge_type:
            for i in naturals(2):
                dst_pt = (row + i * row_delta, col + i * col_delta)
                dst = grid[dst_pt]

                # Found the target node, add
                if is_node(dst):
                    yield dst
                    break

                # Found a connector, continue on the other exit point
                elif dst == '#':
                    yield from neighbors(dst_pt, (row_delta, col_delta))
                    break</code></pre>
<p>Basically, we have eight <code>possible_edges</code>, each of which has a delta along the row and column, along with the character that has to start and end it (the rest could be under something else, we don't really care, since we're making the assumption that the input is well formed).</p>
<p>I did use a couple of helper functions here. They should be fairly obvious:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def is_node(c):
    return c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

def is_edge(c):
    return c in '|-/\\'

def naturals(i = 0):
    while True:
        yield i
            i += 1</code></pre>
<p>That includes one trick I've picked up from my <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/category/programming/by-language/racket">Racket</a> posts. <code>naturals</code> is an infinite list (a generator) of all natural numbers, starting at the given point. It's useful in this case since we don't know how far we're going to run along the edge, just that it will end eventually.</p>
<p>Finally, we need functions to iterate over all of the nodes as starting points and then to print out the results:</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Start at each node and expand all edges
# Note: This will find each edge twice, so it goes
for (src, pt) in nodes.items():
    for dst in neighbors(pt):
        adjacency[src].add(dst)
        adjacency[dst].add(src)

# Print an adjacency matrix in sorted node order
for src in sorted(nodes):
    for dst in sorted(nodes):
        if dst in adjacency[src]:
            sys.stdout.write('1')
        else:
            sys.stdout.write('0')
    sys.stdout.write('\n')</code></pre>
<p>As noted, this will find each edge twice, but so it goes. To account for that, we would have to use up a bit more memory storing the state of where we've been. As it is, we have a mostly functional solution, which I like.</p>
<p>And that's it. Let's see a few of the test cases from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3h0uki/20150814_challenge_227_hard_adjacency_matrix/)">original post</a>:</p>

<p>I wonder how hard it would be to program the inverse: take an adjacency matrix as input and generate one of these graphical matrices as output? Even better, generate an 'optimal' graphic, with the smallest possible area.</p>

<p>First, a bit of background on what exactly DKIM is:</p>
<blockquote>
    DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is an email validation system designed to detect email spoofing by providing a mechanism to allow receiving mail exchangers to check that incoming mail from a domain is authorized by that domain's administrators and that the email (including attachments) has not been modified during transport. A digital signature included with the message can be validated by the recipient using the signer's public key published in the DNS.
    -- Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DKIM">DKIM</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds nice. So what in the world does that mean?</p>
<h2>A bit of background</h2>
<p>Starting in the details, we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_key cryptography">public key cryptography</a>. The basic idea of public key cryptography is that you have some sort of algorithm with two keys: one of which can be used to encrypt things and can be made public and another separate piece of information which can be used to decrypt things and should remain private. That way, you can publish your public key, well, publically. Then anyone that wants to send you a message can do so, knowing that only you (since only you possess the private key) can read it.</p>
<p>If we take this a step further, we can swap the roles of the public and private key<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span>. Instead of encrypting with the public key, we will use the private key, requiring the <em>public</em> key for decryption. This sounds mad, since the public key is, by definition public. So what's the point of a message that only you can write but anyone can read?</p>
<p>Well, that's exactly the point: <em>only you</em> can write it. This is what's called a digital signature. Since only your private key could have encoded the message and since only you have the private key, this allows anyone to read your message and be safe in the knowledge that you wrote it.</p>
<p>This is exactly what DKIM does.</p>
<p>By creating an public/private key pair, publishing the public key to a DNS record, and using the private key to sign messages, you are allowing any receiver to verify that <em>you</em> were person who sent them. Don't get me wrong, there are still a few problems with this approach (we'll get to them later), but it's a cool idea.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>So how do you actually implement it in practice?</p>
<p>Given that I don't have any particular previous experience with mail servers, the answer involves a lot of Google. Here are the steps that worked for me.</p>
<h4>1 - Have a previously configured server correctly delivering mail via <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a></h4>
<h4>2 - Install <a href="http://www.opendkim.org/">OpenDKIM</a></h4>
<pre class="bash"><code>sudo apt-get install -y opendkim opendkim-tools</code></pre>
<h4>3 - Generate a new keypair</h4>
<pre class="bash"><code>sudo opendkim-genkey -s mail -d example.com</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-s</code> argument specifies a selector, which allows us to have multiple keypairs specified on the same domain (if we wanted to), while the <code>-d</code> is the domain we are signing for. In this case, we are generating a record for <code>mail._domainkey.example.com</code>.</p>
<p>This will generate two files. The first is <code>mail.private</code>, which we will move to <code>/etc/opendkim/keys/example.com.private</code> (to match the <code>KeyFile</code> later). Also, we need to make sure that the file has correctly narrow Unix permissions, or OpenDKIM will refuse to use it (for our own safety):</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>sudo chmod 0400 /etc/opendkim/keys/example.com.private
sudo chown opendkim:opendkim /etc/opendkim/keys/example.com.private
sudo adduser postfix opendkim</code></pre>
<p>The second file is <code>mail.txt</code>, which is a DNS record for the above domain. Set it up so this returns successfully:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ dig mail._domainkey.example.com TXT

...
;; ANSWER SECTION:
mail._domainkey.example.com. 599	IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQC5N3lnvvrYgPCRSoqn+awTpE+iGYcKBPpo8HHbcFfCIIV10Hwo4PhCoGZSaKVHOjDm4yefKXhQjM7iKzEPuBatE7O47hAx1CJpNuIdLxhILSbEmbMxJrJAG0HZVn8z6EAoOHZNaPHmK2h4UUrjOG8zA5BHfzJf7tGwI+K619fFUwIDAQAB" ; ----- DKIM key mail for example.com
...</code></pre>
<p>That's (almost) all we have to do to configure the public half of the key pair. (We still have to use the same selector later in the <code>KeyFile</code>, but that's it.)</p>
<h4>4 - Create an OpenDKIM configuration file (<code>/etc/opendkim.conf</code>)</h4>
<pre class="bash"><code>Canonicalization        relaxed/relaxed
ExternalIgnoreList      refile:/etc/opendkim/TrustedHosts
InternalHosts           refile:/etc/opendkim/TrustedHosts
KeyTable                refile:/etc/opendkim/KeyTable
LogWhy                  Yes
MinimumKeyBits          1024
Mode                    sv
PidFile                 /var/run/opendkim/opendkim.pid
SigningTable            refile:/etc/opendkim/SigningTable
Socket                  inet:8891@localhost
Syslog                  Yes
SyslogSuccess           Yes
UMask                   022
UserID                  opendkim:opendkim</code></pre>
<p>What in the world do those all mean? Well, (based somewhat on documentation and somewhat on expirimentation):</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>Canonicalization</code> - controls whether further mail servers can edit the message contents with destroying the signature. <code>relaxed</code> allows more modification, <code>simple</code> is more strict. <code>relaxed</code> seems to be the more common option.</li>
    <li><code>ExternalIgnoreList</code> - hosts that we trust to send us mail; do not validate their DKIM signatures (if present). Specifying <code>refile</code> means that we can use wildcards.</li>
    <li><code>InternalHosts</code> - hosts that will relay mail through us; if we see an unsigned message coming from one of them, sign it before forwarding it along (This is important! I'll get to why in a bit)</li>
    <li><code>KeyTable</code> - a list of private keys we can use to sign messages (included later)</li>
    <li><code>LogWhy</code> - log errors to <code>/var/log/mail.log</code> (useful for debugging)</li>
    <li><code>MinimumKeyBits</code> - flag an error if we try to specify a private key shorter (less secure) than this</li>
    <li><code>Mode</code> - various options, <code>sv</code> is fairly common and means <code>s</code>ign outgoing messages and <code>v</code>erify incoming ones</li>
    <li><code>PidFile</code> - where to store the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_file">PID file</a></li>
    <li><code>SigningTable</code> - specify which key from the <code>KeyTable</code> should be used for a given message</li>
    <li><code>Socket</code> - how Postfix and OpenDKIM communicate</li>
    <li><code>Syslog</code>, <code>SyslogSuccess</code> - log to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syslog">syslog</a> as well as <code>mail.log</code>; log successes as well as failures</li>
    <li><code>UMask</code> - allows other Linux users (such as Postfix's) to talk to OpenDKIM</li>
    <li><code>UserID</code> - the user that OpenDKIM runs as</li>
</ul>
<p>Fairly straight forward.</p>
<h4>5 - Next, another copy of the socket definition in <code>/etc/default/opendkim</code> (I'm actually not sure why this one is necessary)</h4>
<pre class="bash"><code>SOCKET="inet:8891@localhost"</code></pre>
<p>Next, specify our keys in <code>/etc/opendkim/KeyTable</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>example.com example.com:mail:/etc/opendkim/keys/example.com.private</code></pre>
<p>The first entry is a name for the key. It can be anything and doesn't necessary have to match the domain, just so long as the corresponding entry in <code>SigningTable</code> matches. After that, you have the domain where your public key is hosted, the selector on that domain, and where the private key is locally located. So in the above example, <code>example.com:mail</code> corresponds to a key at <code>mail._domainkey.example.com</code>.</p>
<p>And what emails to sign in <code>/etc/opendkim/SigningTable</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>*@example.com example.com
*@*.example.com example.com
*@*.example.org example.com</code></pre>
<p>This one is a bit more complicated, since for my particular case, I had emails coming from two different domains, along with subdomains in both cases (the first field). They can (and in this case) all use the same key, since the second entry matches the value specified in <code>KeyTable</code>.</p>
<p>Note again: Since we're using wildcards here, we have to specify <code>refile</code> up above in <code>opendkim.conf</code>.</p>
<h4>6 - Next, <code>/etc/opendkim/TrustedHosts</code></h4>
<p>This file will be used to specify both incoming message we trust and outgoing message we will sign (although it doesn't have to do both).</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>127.0.0.1
10.77.0.0/16
example.com
*.example.com
*.example.org
*.*.example.org</code></pre>
<p>Entries here can be either IP addresses, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIDR">CIDR</a> style IP ranges, or hostnames (including wildcards, since this is a <code>refile</code>), all of which I use above. This actually took a bit to figure out, since originally I was signing email directly from the box (successfully), but when I attempted to actually send a signed email from the product, it didn't work (since the frontends relay mail to the mail servers).</p>
<h4>7 - Okay, that's enough to configure OpenDKIM. Next, we need to tell Postfix to talk to it</h4>
<p>This one is relatively straight forward as well. Just add a few lines to the bottom of <code>/etc/postfix/main.cf</code>:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code># DKIM
milter_default_action = accept
milter_protocol = 2
smtpd_milters = inet:localhost:8891
non_smtpd_milters = inet:localhost:8891</code></pre>
<p>Essentially, milter is a protocol Postfix uses for plugins. We want to configure all mail traffic (both from smptd and not) to go to OpenDKIM, via the port we specified (twice) earlier. Shiny.</p>
<h4>8 - Finally, restart both OpenDKIM and Postfix, so they can take advantage of their new settings</h4>
<pre class="bash"><code>sudo service opendkim restart
sudo service postfix restart</code></pre>
<p>This should only take a few seconds.</p>
<p>And that's it. We can send a test email:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>echo "test email" | mail -s &lt;code&gt;hostname&lt;/code&gt; me@example.com</code></pre>
<p>That will send an email with the <code>hostname</code> of the current machine to the specified address, useful if you're working with multiple different machines and need to know which are up to date.</p>
<p>Check the message headers and you should see a block that looks like this:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/relaxed; d=example.com; s=mail;
        t=1439063676; bh=RnRlt9pNo9HfghopMAD1V157IZOFVrE6piv9xdXYFNs=;
        h=To:Subject:Reply-To:From:Date;
        b=LekoRRQgOX97WUHP/ELtl/yhMzZsiCPr8kqaYUpZER5sYZ1dyAwgOKKvuI3mL3IMo
         4Y90NDGv+CHm2ZmAaGmFOgGnDPsDxLE+ptleVBP/cQny9grftwA8Emc3MKS6aJ/w5P
         E1bh2wFE8LiRTl/wcof6JL0MyeoR8R63FCKMgnA8=</code></pre>
<p>Bam.</p>
<h2>A few caveats</h2>
<p>So, what is DKIM actually used for?</p>
<p>The original claim is that it's an <em>email validation system designed to detect email spoofing</em>. Which is all well and good, but there's one big problem: adaptation.</p>
<p>Numbers are a little hard to come by, but one site that I found is builtWith trends: <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/mx/DKIM">DKIM Usage Statistics</a>. Their reported coverage notes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Quantcast Top 10k - 14 of 10,000</li>
    <li>Quantcast Top 100k - 104 of 100,000</li>
    <li>Quantcast Top Million - 585 of 865,105</li>
    <li>Entire Internet - 24,064 of 328,844,222</li>
</ul>
<p>That's less than 0.1% in any category. Not so great.</p>
<p>This is a problem, not because it means that mail servers aren't using it, but rather because there is little reason for mail <em>clients</em> to support it. It's easy enough to verify a DKIM signature if present, but they're so rarely present, that most will not go through that effort.</p>
<p>Furthmore, the header does not sign the message headers and (unless you are using SMTP over TLS), it is trivial to remove. If the DKIM header is not present, the message is trivial to modify with the recipient none the wiser. This could be offset--for some business models--by requiring messages to contain a DKIM header and rejecting those that don't.</p>
<p>Still, it's an interesting technology and there's no particular harm (other than a small amount of extra CPU effort to do the signing) in implementing it.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Laundry Files</title><link href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files" /><id>urn:uuid:be3e3e1e-8aa3-4d98-27ca-8ac00ecce18d</id><updated>2015-07-28T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101869.The_Atrocity_Archives"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/1-the-atrocity-archives.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14150.The_Jennifer_Morgue"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/2-the-jennifer-morgue.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7149287-the-fuller-memorandum"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/3-the-fuller-memorandum.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12393566-the-apocalypse-codex"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/4-the-apocalypse-codex.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18211295-the-rhesus-chart"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/5-the-rhesus-chart.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23154785-the-annihilation-score"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/6-the-annihilation-score.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Next up on my <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/50764-laundry-files">The Laundry Files</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8794.Charles_Stross">Charles Stross</a>. Even though this wasn't originally on my list, I ended up just reading this rather than reading two series at once. So it goes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Basic premise: Cthulhian beasties live at the bottom of fractals. Higher mathematics is roughly equivalent to magic. Computers make math/magic far easier to perform.</p>
<p>It's a really cool premise and I'm glad that the series was recommended to me. I've greatly enjoyed following the exploits of Bob, computer programmer turned computational demonologist turned necromancer and his wife Mo: combat violinist.</p>
<p>Fair warning though: Stross takes tropes (such as computer programming, spy stuff, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software development)">scrum method</a>) and turns them up to 11. From time to time, the terminology gets a bit annoying (especially if you're not as familiar with the various fields he's writing about), but personally, I love it.</p>
<p>Now, the same as <a href="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/06/21/rama">Rama</a>, my individual reviews as I read each book:</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101869.The_Atrocity_Archives"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/1-the-atrocity-archives.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>That... was intense.</p>
<p>To really get the most out of this book, I think you'd have to have a certain combination of things in your head: a knowledge of a lot of the more esoteric bits of computer science theory, physics, pop culture, and cosmic horrors. Pretty much right up my alley. Even then, I will admit to having no idea exactly where he was going with a few of those.</p>
<p>It's entirely possible that you'll still like it, even without the same base knowledge. It's still a quick enough read, with enough action to keep you turning the page, even if some of the technical info dumps are probably going to get skipped.</p>
<p>The last bit spent in the other world was fascinating. From a purely academic / world building standpoint, I would love to be able to see how such an alternate universe would deal with the sun going out and the air seeping away. How long would people survive? How would they deal with the beastie making it all happen?</p>
<p>After this, I am definitely going to read the rest of the Laundry Files.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14150.The_Jennifer_Morgue"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/2-the-jennifer-morgue.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This is an excellent follow up to The Atrocity Archives.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Stross managed to tone down the technobabble from ridiculous to only mildly over the top. There's still more than enough references to enjoy and enough neat world building on the (non Euclidean) edges between technology and demonology, but it's not quite hitting you over the head like the first one did.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what he gave up in technobabble, he replaced with spybabble. There are are strong hints of spy novel trappings all over the book. Let's just say though, they are there for a good reason.</p>
<p>One neat addition to this book (although I don't know if she'll be back) is the character of Ramona Random. (view spoiler) (which leads to some more distinctly R rated scenes than the first book had), but I thought she was a really interesting character. Despite--or perhaps because of--her rather problematic backstory, I really started to root for her throughout the book.</p>
<p>Also Mo. She's something of a badass now, taking on the bigwigs both in the Laundry and in the real world. Her violin is an especially interesting bit of world building. I especially love her part towards the end even if I'll admit that I didn't see the twist coming as soon as I could have. I do hope they do more with her in the latter books.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7149287-the-fuller-memorandum"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/3-the-fuller-memorandum.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>(Take 2, the internet ate my first review)</p>
<p>This is another solid entry in the Laundry Files and perhaps my favorite yet. We're really starting to get into some of the more horrific corners of the world. In particular, we learn a bit more about Mo's violin; we get another glimpse into a far flung world (view spoiler); and more about Angleton than I bet Bob ever wanted to know (and I really is explored more in the next books).</p>
<p>On the down side, Bob and Mo continue to have to do some fairly terrible things. There's some fallout from that in this book, but I feel like they just sort of skate by it without really dealing with what's going on. That's either going to come up in a later book or it's going to continue to get weirder when it doesn't.</p>
<p>The writing still pulls you along kicking and screaming. From the halfway point on, and in particular the ending, I couldn't put it down. There are more odd first/third person switches (Bob speaks in first person, everyone else is third person) and in particular a few chapters where I assume the intention is to hide exactly who is speaking. All together, it requires a bit more mental bandwidth to read than the previous two, but it's still worth it.</p>
<p>Looking forward, there are still two novels with Bob as the main character. There are a few things that I really want to see. Fingers crossed.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12393566-the-apocalypse-codex"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/4-the-apocalypse-codex.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The first chunk of this book was a little bit weak, in particularly the introduction of the new character Ms. Hazard. She represents a different style to the magic in this universe, which is interesting, but she just seems too good at her job. In the same manner as Superman, the more powerful someone becomes, the harder it is to make them interesting.</p>
<p>That does get better in the later half of the book, especially in the climax. I'm still not sure what to think about the mixed first/third person writing style, but it is interesting to see some of the scenes from two very different points of view. I miss Mo though.</p>
<p>So far as world building goes, Stross continues to build out the more interesting parts of the world, building towards an eventual apocalypse (or at least rather bad day). The visuals of the Sleeper and the Pyramid are still some of my favorite parts of these books, especially the idea that the wall from the previous books is designed to keep people out, not in. I hadn't gotten that impression before.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18211295-the-rhesus-chart"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/5-the-rhesus-chart.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Vampires don't exist.</p>
<p>Or at least that's what everyone in the Laundry believes. Turns out... there's a good reason for that.</p>
<p>From the perspective of someone in software development, the maddening extent at which the Scrum operates is amusing and all too close to home. After twisting first computer science and spy stuff into this world, it was neat to see the new topic.</p>
<p>My one real complaint with this book is that I think it's out of order. It's significantly smaller in scope than the previous two books where I was hoping for even more escalation towards CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN, rather than something somewhat more down to home. Although on the other hand, a few of the events in this book need the previous books to make sense. Still it's weird.</p>
<p>Now, sadly, I've finished the Bob focused Laundry Files novels released to date. So it goes. I look forward to the next.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23154785-the-annihilation-score"><img src="http://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/28/laundry-files/6-the-annihilation-score.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The Annihilation Score takes a bit of a different take from the previous five books, shifting the viewpoint from the previous hero* Bob to his wife Mo.</p>
<p>Previously, Mo had been one of my favorite characters in the series. She's just mysterious enough that she's interesting, coming in to save the day with a truly terrifying violin. Unfortunately, the more I know about her, the less I care.</p>
<p>The basic idea is interesting enough. Basically, as the world careens towards madness, magic is becoming more prevalent. But people don't believe in magic anymore, they believe in superheroes. One thing leads to another and Mo ends up leading a mostly publicly known super-hero task force. Much as The Rhesus Chart, despite the incoming danger, this feels like a de-escalation from the first four books.</p>
<p>One problem that annoyed me throughout the book was the relationship between Bob and Mo. I get it, they've been through Hell (literally) and they're each dealing with their own demons (again, literally), but I don't really understand their reactions to it. It feels more like Stross needed to get Bob out of the picture. So it goes.</p>
<p>Overall, I miss Bob. I miss Mo as a secondary character. I still enjoyed this more than enough to continue the series when the next comes out.</p>
<p>* For some definitions of hero.</p>
<hr />
<p>Amusingly, I haven't actually read that many ongoing series this year. If/when the next book comes out, I'll probably update this post.</p>

<p>Luckily, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">boto</a>:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import boto.iam.connection
import pprint
import sys

if len(sys.argv) == 1:
    print('Usage: who-iam [access-key ...]')
    sys.exit(0)

conn = boto.iam.connection.IAMConnection()
users = conn.get_all_users()

for user in users['list_users_response']['list_users_result']['users']:
    keys = conn.get_all_access_keys(user['user_name'])
    for key in keys['list_access_keys_response']['list_access_keys_result']['access_key_metadata']:
        for target in sys.argv[1:]:
            if key['access_key_id'] == target:
                print(key['access_key_id'], user['user_name'])</code></pre>
<p>Check it out (keys changed on the off chance that actually matters):</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ who-iam AKIAIOSWISKB6EXAMPLE AKIAIOSGWISN7EXAMPLE
AKIAIOSWISKB6EXAMPLE luke
AKIAIOSGWISN7EXAMPLE han</code></pre>
<p>It's rather slow (since it has to make <code>O(n)</code> requests and doesn't short circuit), but this should be something you do rarely enough that it doesn't matter.</p>
