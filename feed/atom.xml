&lt;p>Apparently in all the wacky parallel universe shenanigans, Maestro “rescued” a bunch of Hulks and brought them back to this world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowing basically nothing about how Maestro came to be or what all these Hulks can actually do, it’s a strange story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Magician King</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/20/the-magician-king/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/20/the-magician-king/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>That was the thing about the world: it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that things were harder than you thought they were going to be, it was that they were hard in ways that you didn&amp;rsquo;t expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Turns out, if you take &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/16/the-magicians/">The Magicians&lt;/a>, tone down Quentin a bit, and cut the magic school parts to focus mostly on Fillory and adventuring, you get a much better book. It&amp;rsquo;s still a bit much at times and definitely has some &amp;lsquo;middle book syndrome&amp;rsquo; going on, but I quite enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you didn&amp;rsquo;t like the Magicians, you might like this book. If you liked it, particularly the second half, this is probably right up your alley.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 5: Past Lives</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/19/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-5-past-lives/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/19/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-5-past-lives/</guid><description>&lt;p>Memories of the past/future…&lt;/p>

&lt;p>And he wants to go back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This can’t possibly go well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially when none of his “friends” will help, so he has to turn to darker sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we end up with is Logan bouncing (again) through time, reliving his old adventures for a few pages at a time, unable to change anything that matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s an interesting idea, but once again it doesn’t really have time to breath. All too soon, we’re back to the status quo.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Skinwalker</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/18/skinwalker/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/18/skinwalker/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that was fun. I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for a good new (to me) Urban Fantasy&amp;ndash;and Jane Yellowrock (so far) hits all the right notes. The worldbuilding is neat. The plot is basic enough, but solid. I like the main character(s). And I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing where it goes from here!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the biggest/really only negative with the book is that the writing style starts out fairly rough. It evens out fairly quickly though, so I expect it&amp;rsquo;s more of both the author and the reader finding the voice of the book than anything else.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Underworld: Awakening</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/16/underworld-awakening/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/16/underworld-awakening/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while. Both since watching {{crosslink &amp;ldquo;Underworld: Rise of the Lycans&amp;rdquo;}} and in universe.
I really like the idea of advancing the world. Bringing the Vampires and the Lycans out into the open. And the humans winning as, with their numbers, makes enough sense in this universe.
Selene: For 12 years, I was held captive by the humans. The world I once knew has changed. Vampires and Lycans are now the hunted.</description></item><item><title>The Magicians</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/16/the-magicians/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/16/the-magicians/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I got my heart&amp;rsquo;s desire, and there my troubles began.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well. The majority of comments certainly nailed this one. Two interesting premises in a trenchcoat wrapped in the guise of cynicism and dark humor, underscored by the most depressed to the point of hard to read main character I think I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interesting enough I&amp;rsquo;ll give the sequel a try (I really liked the ending twists(ish)). I wish it were better.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Downton Abbey: Season 5</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/13/downton-abbey-season-5/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Aug 2023 23:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/13/downton-abbey-season-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh goodness. Another season down and only one more to go (plus some movies?). I&amp;rsquo;m not ready!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This one has a few primarily focuses:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mary and her men&amp;hellip; weird. I kind of liked both of them, but so it goes. Hints at what&amp;rsquo;s to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Isobel and Violet (of all people) getting romantically entangled. That I did not expect, much less with who. It&amp;rsquo;s fun, if sad at times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rose, speedrunning the relationship thing, all with yet another new family for people to disapprove of. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that her dating a black man went so poorly, yet this ends up much better?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course the Bates. Oh the Bates. I truly wish that Season 6 could be quiet and happy for them&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;m not holding up too much hope for that one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, yet another solid season. Like I said, I&amp;rsquo;m not ready for the end! But all good things must. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>StackLang Part IX: Better Testing</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/12/stacklang-part-ix-better-testing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/12/stacklang-part-ix-better-testing/</guid><description>Two posts in two days?

&lt;p>It’s fascinating seeing Logan’s past, everything between when the villains took over and when he got sent to the Battleworlds, intermixed with the current present.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fascinating… and bloody. But that’s Wolverine for you.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yeah… I’m not sure what else he thought might happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily, a few big fights, a pile of blood and bodies, and a visit with a young old friend later and he seems to get the idea.&lt;/p>

Until a freak airship accident&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> kills the Emperor and all of his early heirs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suddenly, Maia is thrust into a whole new life. A life of money and power; but also a life without privacy, a life that he has &lt;em>absolutely&lt;/em> no idea how to deal with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For better or for worse, The Goblin Emperor has surprisingly low stakes. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a book about the new emperor standing against invasion. It&amp;rsquo;s not about some world ending threat. It&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em>really&lt;/em> even about traitors trying to take the throne&amp;ndash;although that one at least we get a bit of&lt;sup id="fnref1:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I actually really like it. It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;lsquo;slice of life&amp;rsquo; (a genre I&amp;rsquo;ve recently really started to love), where the life is that of a new Emperor.

&lt;p>Oh, there&amp;rsquo;s so much going on in this season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both large (Kaylon! Moclan! Krill! new friends and foes alike!) and small (so many relationships! new crew and old!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see how much this show has grown and changed. I just about bounced off the first few episodes, back when it was leaning hard into the humor and less into the sci-fi. But now&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see both the funny and the serious takes on all sorts of issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A delightful third season. If/when we get a Season 4, I&amp;rsquo;ll most certainly have to check it out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 1: Berzerker</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/05/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-1-berzerker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/05/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-1-berzerker/</guid><description>&lt;p>And now, after &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/03/wolverine-old-man-logan/">Wolverine: Old Man Logan&lt;/a> in the apocalyptic future and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/04/wolverine-old-man-logan-vol.-0-warzones/">Wolverine: Old Man Logan, Vol. 0: Warzones!&lt;/a> in Battleworld, we&amp;rsquo;re finally back in the present&amp;ndash;and, I assume, in the main universe?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Old Man Logan of course goes straight from shock to murder. If he&amp;rsquo;s in the past (from his own point of view), well then of course he&amp;rsquo;s going to have to &lt;em>fix the future&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-1-210d15.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if this isn&amp;rsquo;t actually &lt;em>his&lt;/em> past? What if it isn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>his&lt;/em> future that he&amp;rsquo;s setting out to change?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat idea, but a bit thin on execution. I would have rather him kick up a bit more trouble before starting to figure things out. Seeing an equally old Captain America (no idea what the story was there) was neat. But the real amusing part is the apart team up with Kate Bishop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/old-man-logan-1-a65f7c.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not at all who I would have picked&amp;hellip; but amusing!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to think. I really liked the &lt;em>world&lt;/em> of Old Man Logan. Now we have Logan without that world. Bit of a bait and switch, but I suppose it has potential.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating bit of story, with poor &amp;lsquo;Old Man&amp;rsquo; Logan bouncing between a world (or two) where the X-Men live, a world where anyone not in Iron man armor contracts a techno virus, and a world of the dead.
On the other hand, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really go anywhere&amp;ndash;not until we get to Secret Wars itself.</description></item><item><title>Spells for Forgetting</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/03/spells-for-forgetting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/03/spells-for-forgetting/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mom had gotten better through the years at blending in and appearing at first glance like other mothers. But she still spent the equinox in the woods and the solstice at the sea. She still whispered old words over her teacups and I’d caught her muttering a curse as we passed the front door of our neighbor’s house more than once.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating sort of book; dark and magical and a bit surreal. The more twisted aspects of &amp;lsquo;small town&amp;rsquo; life, a murder mystery, and romance all in one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/03/mr.-penumbras-24-hour-bookstore/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2023 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/08/03/mr.-penumbras-24-hour-bookstore/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh, to have such potential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take the idea of a used bookstore in San Francisco. Give it an awesome name. Skinny, but three stories tall (and I imagine, open all the way up rather than having 3 actual floors). Add a mysterious &amp;lsquo;back&amp;rsquo; section, where strange people come to &amp;lsquo;borrow&amp;rsquo; strange books. Some sort of secret society? A merging of new* technologies&amp;ndash;e-readers! search engines! OCR! book scanning!&amp;ndash;and archaic&amp;ndash;books! printing presses! actually; that&amp;rsquo;s about it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s got the seeds of what should have been a great story!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really do love the early setting of the book. It&amp;rsquo;s got a perfect magical feel to it. I really want to visit Mr. Penumbra&amp;rsquo;s!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But unfortunately, from there (and in my opinion), it goes somewhat off the rails. Everything feels too each. The characters are all a bit &amp;rsquo;too much&amp;rsquo;. The technology (a big part of the book) all feels slightly off. The big reveal is &amp;hellip; meh?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting premise stretched thin.

&lt;p>I think that I really like the Marvel stories that take place a bit further from our own world&amp;ndash;gives them a chance to really change things up. And multiple universes lets you have characters you know and love&amp;ndash;and brutally murder them. Always a good time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“I knew about faeries. They didn’t,” she protested. She hated the faery inability to lie more and more as he spoke. It would be easier to lie and deny how painlessly she had become fey. It would be easier to say that she wasn’t adjusting to her new life far faster than she’d ever thought. It would be easier to say she was struggling. Because then he wouldn’t be doing this to me.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/ink-exchange/">Ink Exchange&lt;/a>, I was worried.

&lt;p>For every nine years, the fold from Beyond the Wall and over the hill set up their stalls, and for a day and a night the meadow played host to the Faerie market; and there was, for one day and one night in nine years, commerce between the nations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I do love Neil Gaiman&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. He does weird/creepy/dark perfectly well. Stardust is a great example of &lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a dark fairy tale, a la the Brothers Grimm. A city on the border between Victorian England and Fairie. The contrast of worlds. An adventure full of princes and witches, woodland animals, magic, and of course: fairy tale love.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a great listen. A bit weird, since apparently it was also originally published in graphic novel format and is also supposed to be a great movie.

&lt;p>“Time,” he said solemnly, “is comparable to a river flowing under a layer of ice. It stretches us out like water weeds, from root to tip, from birth to death, curled around whatever rocks or snags happen to lie in our path; and no one can get out of the river because of the ice roof, and no one can turn back against the current for an instant.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have a magical mishap that blows holes in time, secret societies at each other&amp;rsquo;s throats, beggers&amp;rsquo; guilds, poets, time traveling tourism, and body swapping shenanigans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s certainly a longer read, yet even with the runtime I found myself wanting more in certain areas.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Frugal Wizard’s Handbook for Surviving Medieval England</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/27/the-frugal-wizards-handbook-for-surviving-medieval-england/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/27/the-frugal-wizards-handbook-for-surviving-medieval-england/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What products did one use in Anglo-Saxon England? Beaver snot? A grudging four stars.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, I feel like “a grudging four stars” is about where this book ends up for me. Not bad, but given how much I&amp;rsquo;ve loved just about everything else Sanderson, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit lower.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Secret Wars</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/25/secret-wars/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/25/secret-wars/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I picked up Secret Wars as a sort of conclusion to the Ultimate Universe. Without having read basically any of the leading material in the main Earth-616 lineup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/secret-wars-textbundle-07da17.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird and confusing what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eventually, you more or less get the idea, but until then, it&amp;rsquo;s really like being dropped into yet another crazy chaotic patchwork world, with Doom as God.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s actually a pretty cool world&amp;ndash;truth be told&amp;ndash;with lots of variations on characters we&amp;rsquo;ve seen otherwise. I enjoy the idea of a whole army of Thors as the local police force. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But eventually, we get a few stowaways from Earth-616 and &amp;hellip; well, one* from Earth-1610 (the Ultimate Universe) I&amp;rsquo;ve been following (*: two technically, we also get Maker&amp;ndash;yay&amp;hellip;). And that&amp;rsquo;s really it. Eventually they have to save the day and rewrite time. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a way to kill off Earth-1610 and a bunch of other universes in order to simplify the overall multiverse?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kind of sucks that untold billions have to die / never have existed for that to happen&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall: Interesting enough story, especially a few issues in where what&amp;rsquo;s actually going on becomes more clear. Ending is kind of lame. The reason Miles gets to stick around (despite his being the best storyline in a while from the Ultimate Universe) is &amp;hellip; hilarious and weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to read something a bit less &amp;hellip; all encompassing for a while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate End</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/25/ultimate-end/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/25/ultimate-end/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so the Ultimate Universe ends&amp;hellip; with a weird confusing mess of a send off?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s sort of a companion to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/25/secret-wars/">Secret Wars&lt;/a>, more specifically focusing on what is happening in the Earth-1610/Ultimate Universe part of the Battleworld&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s not really necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All you need to know is that this is the &amp;hellip; Ultimate End.&lt;/p>

It worked much better in Volume 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Same team, same smaller stakes. Not going to lose states (again), but plenty of lives are on the line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s interesting seeing the team dynamics (on again, off again, half a dozen times in a single volume…).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The art for this one got weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ultimates name still doesn’t really work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it’s weird that the Kate Bishop story line almost 100% got dropped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward to the end.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lock In</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/lock-in/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/lock-in/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Making people change because you can’t deal with who they are isn’t how it’s supposed to be done. What needs to be done is for people to pull their heads out of their asses. You say ‘cure.’ I hear ‘you’re not human enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Been a bit since I last read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2018/08/23/old-mans-war/">any Scalzi&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;m glad to get back around to it though. Lock In is very good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, Lock In takes place in a near future Earth where a flu-like pandemic (Haden&amp;rsquo;s Syndrome) has caused &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/locked-in%20syndrome">locked-in syndrome&lt;/a> in some small percent of the world&amp;rsquo;s population (a small percent of billions is still an awful lot of people). Those affected are completely paralyzed, unable to move, while still being fully aware and conscious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily(ish) a massive global effort has figured out how to embed computer hardware in their brains so as to allow them to remotely pilot either robotic bodies (threeps&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>) or (more rarely) other humans who&amp;rsquo;ve allowed them access&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This of course is widely accepted by the rest of humanity and causes no issues whatsoever.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Getting ink felt right, like it would help her put her life in order, to move forwards. It was her body, despite the things that&amp;rsquo;d been done to it, and she wanted to claim it, to own it, to prove that to herself. She knew it wasn&amp;rsquo;t magic, but the idea of writing her own identity felt like the closest she could get to reclaiming her life. Sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s power in the act; sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s strength in words. She wanted to find an image that represented those things she was feeling, to etch it on her skin as tangible proof of her decision to change.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s not what I expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s definitely a sequel to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/wicked-lovely/">Wicked Lovely&lt;/a>. In that it&amp;rsquo;s in the same world with many of the same characters and takes place after the events of the first book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; fine? It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, if a bit jarring, to see more of the world and a broader cast of characters. But the plot is ugly, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to root for anyone really, and I missed the continuity you get from sticking with a united point of view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: trigger warning for rape. Off screen, but it&amp;rsquo;s a major plot point of the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll probably try one more in the series, since it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to go back to Ash. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh that was delightful. How did I not watch this sooner?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell: it&amp;rsquo;s a standard &amp;ldquo;save Christmas&amp;rdquo; plotline gone so &lt;em>very &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> alien. With Mantis and Drax having the main plotline to bring Peter Quill that one perfect gift is so fun. They&amp;rsquo;re just alien enough to bring more than a touch of chaos with them to Earth while at the same time human enough to relate to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, don&amp;rsquo;t expect anything deeper than the above. There really isn&amp;rsquo;t anything here you&amp;rsquo;d miss by not watching&amp;ndash;but on the other other hand it&amp;rsquo;s a quick watch and fun enough to be worth it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>All-New Ultimates, Volume 1: Power for Power</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/22/all-new-ultimates-volume-1-power-for-power/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/22/all-new-ultimates-volume-1-power-for-power/</guid><description>So, a new team. It’s… certainly not the Ultimates, despite the name. More of a Spidey and Friends.
But you know? It works.
It’s a lot more local level, where Spider-Man really shines. It’s fun seeing Bombshell grown up a bit. Cloak and Dagger are great. Yay Jessica Drew.
And yay ish Kitty Pride? She’s been there since just about the beginning. Pretty crazy to think.
Anyways. I enjoyed it.</description></item><item><title>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/21/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/21/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania/</guid><description>&lt;p>Upside: It&amp;rsquo;s visually super colorful and weird and it&amp;rsquo;s got a lot of potential for the new MCU Phase 5!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Downside: It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; weird and chaotic and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really fit with anything else we particularly know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; fine? I enjoyed watching it, but it&amp;rsquo;s in the category of MCU films that I doubt I&amp;rsquo;d watch again unless I&amp;rsquo;m doing a full rewatch (which is getting to be quite the endeavor).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man, Vol. 2: Revelations</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/21/miles-morales-ultimate-spider-man-vol.-2-revelations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/21/miles-morales-ultimate-spider-man-vol.-2-revelations/</guid><description>&lt;p>Resolution of the Parker storyline: check.

&lt;p>Haven’t you ever been in a fairy tale before?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s one of those books that just &lt;em>feels&lt;/em> like a fairy tale. An ageless story. A story passed down from long ago ages of myth and fantasy.

&lt;p>Nah, Future Foundation!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a really weird story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Random incursions from random dimensions. Animal people. Cyclops super heroes. Atlanteans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And oy talk about tonal whiplash. Death and doom to animal people to kidnapping to quippy one liners to rape. All over the place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally, the art. It starts off, a bit unfinished… but I kind of like it. But then it gets even more unfinished and cartoony. Not a fan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a vaguely interesting story wrapped up in a lot of weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not surprised this is all it got.&lt;/p>

Figured it was probably about time. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, take the modern world and turn a number of interesting trends up to 11. Dissolve family ties. Genetically engineer children as a sort of uber-caste system. Make sex purely recreational. Add to that the perspective of &amp;rsquo;the Savage&amp;rsquo;. One raised on a reservation without this &amp;lsquo;modern&amp;rsquo; world&amp;ndash;giving an outsider&amp;rsquo;s perspective to all the changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the craziest thing is that this book was written in 1932&amp;hellip; Oddly prescient that. It could extrapolate from today&amp;rsquo;s world about as easily as the world of almost a century ago. Probably a bit more influence from the Internet and social media; perhaps more commentary on how the sexual revolution in Brave New World compares to what actually happened in the decades after the book&amp;rsquo;s release. But I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what else I&amp;rsquo;d see changed. A mark of good distopian sci-fi, that.

&lt;p>Uh oh. Gah Lak Tus? Time to meet GALACTUS!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m sure this will go well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being titled Cataclysm—and the last in the Ultimate Marvel Universe line—after all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The X-Men’s involvement? Meh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spider-Man? Pretty awesome. Touching and personal, even in the face of a giant purple guy with a fancy hat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ultimates: what is with that art style? Everyone getting infected with Galactus is amusing. Purple Hulk!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ultimates Last Stand? The meat of the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reed Richard&amp;rsquo;s redemption arc (of a sort)? What&amp;hellip; he does not deserve that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s kind of a deus ex solution to an impossible problem. But that’s sort of the way with comics.&lt;/p>

That was not necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel like most of these &amp;lsquo;big events&amp;rsquo; have ended up being overwhelming. They just need more room to breathe than comics can give them. The &amp;lsquo;smaller&amp;rsquo; scale comics (like Spider-Man) do so much better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/age-of-ultron-textbundle-f8d500.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There are three conditions you must agree to meet before I grant you this opportunity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Firstly, the considerable skill you possess must be used only for good. You will not let bitterness or anger draw you down the darker ways of your craft.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Secondly, if anyone asks for your help, you will give it willingly. I do not mean solely those who come to you for assistance with their ailments, but anyone at all who seeks your aid.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“And thirdly?” It occurred to me that I could be as good a liar as anyone. What was to stop me from agreeing now, and once I was out of here, doing whatever I pleased? I might yet live beyond dawn and see Mathuin brought down before nightfall. My heart began to race.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Take a bit of magic/folklore in an oldentimes Ireland; add in a Fae bargain (with all the complications that ensues); combine with a prince and princess who&amp;rsquo;ve never met outside of letters&amp;ndash;and seem entirely different in person; and finish it all off with fairy tale magic of Dreamer&amp;rsquo;s Pool.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wicked Lovely</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/wicked-lovely/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 17:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/wicked-lovely/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s YA Urban Fantasy.

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not the best Urban Fantasy I&amp;rsquo;ve read, but it&amp;rsquo;s really not bad. The world-alongside-our-world of the Fae is fairly standard, the romance is mostly predictable, and there are few enough action scenes. But on the other hand, the world feels real enough, I liked Aislinn more than I had any right to, and I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued what happens next. And that&amp;rsquo;s more enough for a quick read in my opinion!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics: Iron Man</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/ultimate-comics-iron-man/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 17:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/ultimate-comics-iron-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>So much continues to change in the Post-Wave world&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead let’s introduce some new foe in the Mandarin. Hacking in and taking over Stark Tech. The Iron Man suit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neat idea but feels incomplete. Both in what I expected post Ultimatum and in the resolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>StackLang Part V: Compiling to C</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/stacklang-part-v-compiling-to-c/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/12/stacklang-part-v-compiling-to-c/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit, but I hope it&amp;rsquo;s worth it.

&lt;p>Turns out, pretending the Sentient Seed died out lasted… not at all. Now there’s a new Mutant homeland in America…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-comics-x-men-wood-2-textbundle-475838.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s actually really cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course Tian isn’t thrilled by the competition. It’s kind of amazing that after so long, Jean is still around. This has potential… but she’s starting with lies. I’m sure it will go well. Especially if she’s both hiding and going by her original name. Wat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it’s a neat story. If I didn’t know the Ultimate line was nearly over, I’d be intrigued. So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
