<p>The world is just cool, with crystal power systems, airships, and sentient, speaking cats. Everything feels like it fits together in a believable enough world while at the same time leaves me wanting to know more! Why were the spires built? What's the rest of the world like? What's with the Etherialists? Etc.</p>
<p>The characters are a lot of fun. Bridget and Gwen are great examples of what kickass women can be, both in different ways. At first I thought the cats would be overplayed and cheesy, but they really do grow on you. They actually feel like I imagine cats would be if they could speak. Grim is a solid captain and I was glad to see everything work out as well as it did for him. I'm curious where that will go next. The Etherialists are a fun sort of detached from reality.</p>
<p>Writing wise, I think the coolest parts of this book were the airship battles. It's a completely different sort of battle than you see, with maneuvers in a full three dimensions and energy weapons and shields. The last battle was a bit strange since we got a lot of details (via audience surrogate at the time Gwen) that I would have expected to see earlier rather than at the climax, but they still showed that Butcher thought through how a lot of the battles would work.</p>
<p>Overall, the plot was fairly straight forward, with obvious good guys and bad guys (and a mysterious shadowy figure behind the scenes). It was easy enough to see where it was going, but that doesn't really weaken it. It works well both as a standalone novel but also as the start of a series.</p>
<p>Aside: I listened to the audiobook. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/169487.James_Marsters">James Marsters</a> (who narrates the Dresden Files) is a hard act to follow, but <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2961721.Euan_Morton">Euan Morton</a> did a great job. I like the character's voices. Particularly Rawl's. It's interesting to listen to an audiobook of a book I haven't read before--I had to backtrack twice due to missing something.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a great book. I look forward to the sequels--only tempered by wanting to see the rest of the Dresden Files as well.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Duplicating AeroSnap on OSX with Hammerspoon</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/02/08/duplicating-aerosnap-on-osx-with-hammerspoon" /><id>urn:uuid:09374126-32e6-69a9-1a73-8141f97dec1a</id><updated>2016-02-08T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Relatively recently, I switched my last Windows machine over to OSX.

One bit of functionality that I've been missing though is AeroSnap. Specifically the ability to use a keyboard shortcut to move windows to the left/right half of a monitor.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For a while, <a href="https://www.boastr.net/">BetterTouchTool</a> provided that functionality for me, among it's many (many) other options. Unfortunately (for me, it's a good move for them), the author(s) of BetterTouchTool are now moving to a paid model. Since I use only a tiny fraction of the functionality, I decided to see if there were other options.</p>
<p>The first thing that I stumbled across was <a href="https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt">ShiftIt</a>. It actually has exactly the functionality that I wanted and was configurable enough that I could tweak the keybindings to what my fingers already expected them to be. If you don't particularly want to tweak the functionality and just want AeroSnapesqe functionality, this is probably a good enough option.</p>
<p>Me though? I love to tweak things.</p>
<p>With unusually precient timing, Lifehacker posted an article about <a href="http://www.hammerspoon.org/">Hammerspoon</a>: <a href="http://lifehacker.com/hammerspoon-is-powerful-free-automation-tool-for-os-x-1757351485">Hammerspoon Is Powerful, Free Automation Tool for OS X</a></p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>After a bit of digging, I found that their <a href="http://www.hammerspoon.org/go/">Getting Started</a> document actually has an example that does exactly what I want to do: <a href="http://www.hammerspoon.org/go/#winresize">Window sizing</a> Shiny!</p>
<p>A bit of tweaking and this is what I ended up with:</p>
<h3><code>.hammerspoon/init.lua</code></h3>
<p>Base code, handles reloading, locking, and loading modules</p>
<pre class="lua"><code>-- Reload hammerspoon configs
hs.hotkey.bind({"cmd", "ctrl"}, "R", function()
    hs.reload()
end)
hs.alert.show("Config loaded")

-- Lock
hs.hotkey.bind({"cmd", "ctrl"}, 'L', function()
    os.execute("open '/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Versions/A/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app'")
end)

require('aerosnap')</code></pre>
<p>The first is another example from their documentation of bind a keyboard shortcut to reloading the Hammerspoon documentation. The second is another keyboard shortcut I missed from Windows: the ability to lock the screen without logging out (the normal lock functionality disables networking and thus things like remote login).</p>
<h3><code>.hammerspoon/aerosnap/init.lua</code></h3>
<pre class="lua"><code>-- Aerosnap helper functions to get and set current window parameters
function aerosnap_get_parameters()
    local window = hs.window.focusedWindow()
    local frame = window:frame()
    local screen = window:screen()
    local bounds = screen:frame()

    return window, frame, bounds
end

-- Aerosnap help to move a window to a specified position
function aerosnap_move_window(x, y, w, h)
    local window, frame, bounds = aerosnap_get_parameters()

    frame.x = x
    frame.y = y
    frame.w = w
    frame.h = h

    window:setFrame(frame)
end

-- Save the current window's position so we can restore it
function aerosnap_save_window()
    local window, frame, bounds = aerosnap_get_parameters()
    saved_window_sizes = saved_window_sizes or {}
    saved_window_sizes[window:id()] = {x = frame.x, y = frame.y, w = frame.w, h = frame.h}
end

-- Aerosnap move window to the left half
hs.hotkey.bind({"cmd", "ctrl"}, "Left", function()
    local window, frame, bounds = aerosnap_get_parameters()
    aerosnap_save_window()
    aerosnap_move_window(bounds.x, bounds.y, bounds.w / 2, bounds.h)
end)

-- Aerosnap move window to the right half
hs.hotkey.bind({"cmd", "ctrl"}, "Right", function()
    local window, frame, bounds = aerosnap_get_parameters()
    aerosnap_save_window()
    aerosnap_move_window(bounds.x + bounds.w / 2, bounds.y, bounds.w / 2, bounds.h)
end)

-- Aerosnap maximize current window, saving size to restore
hs.hotkey.bind({"cmd", "ctrl"}, "Up", function()
    local window, frame, bounds = aerosnap_get_parameters()
    aerosnap_save_window()
    aerosnap_move_window(bounds.x, bounds.y, bounds.w, bounds.h)
end)

-- Restore the last saved window configuration for a window (basically, a one level undo)
hs.hotkey.bind({"cmd", "ctrl"}, "Down", function()
    local window, frame, bounds = aerosnap_get_parameters()

    old_bounds = saved_window_sizes[window:id()]
    if old_bounds ~= nil then
        aerosnap_move_window(old_bounds.x, old_bounds.y, old_bounds.w, old_bounds.h)
        saved_window_sizes[window:id()] = nil
    end
end)</code></pre>
<p>Basically, I took the same functionality that they had in the demo and factored out the functionality that gets the current window / sets the new sizes. The other interesting bit is the <code>aerosnap_save_window</code> function, which allows you to restore the size of a window you had just maximized. This does have something of a memory leak (in that it never clears up closed windows), but the amount should be small enough that it doesn't overly matter.</p>
<p>And that's it. My full configs are available in my dotfiles (if I make any further tweaks or add more functionality): <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/dotfiles/tree/master/hammerspoon">hammerspoon configs</a></p>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing what else I can do with Hammerspoon. You can get fairly extensive: <a href="https://github.com/tstirrat/hammerspoon-config">example Hammerspoon config</a>.</p>
<p>Also, if you want an alternative to Hammerspoon with what looks like a more modular approach, check out <a href="https://github.com/sdegutis/mjolnir">Mjolnir</a>. It appears that Hammerspoon is a fork of Mjolnir, so their configs are rather similar.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>The Keys to the Kingdom</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom" /><id>urn:uuid:130c2fa9-32c6-b770-a218-f91e76391d32</id><updated>2016-01-07T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47613.Mister_Monday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/1-mister-monday.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47620.Grim_Tuesday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/2-grim-tuesday.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47619.Drowned_Wednesday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/3-drowned-wednesday.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47618.Sir_Thursday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/4-sir-thursday.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17206.Lady_Friday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/5-lady-friday.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2049823.Superior_Saturday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/6-superior-saturday.jpg" /></a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6657648-lord-sunday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/7-lord-sunday.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>The basic idea is that the Creator of the Universe has left the building--literally. They left behind a Will, but the seven Trustees in charge of seeing it done choose not to. One of these bits of sentient Will chooses a random pre-teen (or is he 13? it's unclear) to be the Heir to the Kingdom/House, by way of making him fight each of the seven Trustees in turn.</p>
<p>It's a weird world, but fun to read. There are a few interesting thoughts in there and plenty of quick, kid friendly (mostly) action.</p>
<p>Individual reviews (spoilers):</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47613.Mister_Monday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/1-mister-monday.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that Arthur died. He had a massive asthma attack, and, as his oxygen starved brain struggled its last, he hallucinated all of the rest. How else do you describe just how ... odd this book is.</p>
<p>That being said, I liked it. It's weird. Garth Nix really does his Proper Nouns. Everything felt like it Meant Something, although we never quite got a perfect idea what Anything was. Most of them were close enough though; so it goes. It's quick and the action picks you up and pulls you right through the story. When it's over, there's something of a feel of getting off a roller coaster, but in a good way.</p>
<p>Final thoughts: Is this series really going to take place over a week (Earth time)? All righty then.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47620.Grim_Tuesday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/2-grim-tuesday.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Of course they're all going to take place over a week (Earth time)...</p>
<p>There's really not much different between Mister Monday and Grim Tuesday. Arthur is starting to accept his fate while at the same time learning more about the rules of the House. It interesting to see him change even in just the first two books thus far.</p>
<p>It's nice to see a bit more of Suzy and also a bit more of the House. I see how they're going to have a different setting and antagonist each day, with an overarching world to tie them together. It's a neat idea and I want to see it all of the way through.</p>
<p>Also, apparently the Morrow Days are the 7 Deadly Sins? Was that ever explicitly mentioned?  Sloth and Greed down, 5 to go.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47619.Drowned_Wednesday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/3-drowned-wednesday.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The world of the Keys to the Kingdom continues to get more interesting and weirder all at once. This time around, we have a sort of Multiversal Ocean and the Morrow Day that governs it. It's an interesting world all itself, with ships that were once other things, uplifted rats, and a very Nix'ian version of the Jonah and Whale story.</p>
<p>It's neat to finally see one of the Morrow Days that actually wants to help. I'm guessing we won't see much of that with the other half.</p>
<p>Also, oh snap that cliff hanger at the end. These really are seven parts of a seven part serialized novel. Nothing wrong with that though. It's an interesting style. I wonder if Nix wrote all seven of them before publishing?</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47618.Sir_Thursday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/4-sir-thursday.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Not much to say. Onwards and upwards for Arthur, taking on another of the Trustees and gaining another of the Keys.</p>
<p>Pretty much all of the problems in this book seemed overly easy to subdue, the Skinless Boy and Sir Thursday included. I think this has been going on for all of the rest of the books, but it seemed even more obvious in this one. Perhaps it's a factor of how relatively short they are?</p>
<p>Although on the flip side, setting things up with <spoiler>the Piper</spoiler> was interesting. I expected him to show up at some point, but this was a little different.</p>
<p>Also Dame Primus is totally going to be a problem. Called it here.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17206.Lady_Friday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/5-lady-friday.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>It's interesting throughout the whole series, Nix has managed to combine a relatively formulaic story with new twists and weird new worlds in each and every book.</p>
<p>The House just keeps getting weirder. I'm not sure how it's even really a 'House' at all. I think originally it was going to be and the Tuesday and Wednesday happened...</p>
<p>We don't actually see much of Lady Friday; the least of any thus far. So it goes.</p>
<p>It's interesting to see Arthur finally accept that he's going to finish this and, to do that, he has to use the Keys. Given how narrow a margin he was on before, I was curious how long that would take.</p>
<p>The Will is going to be a problem...</p>
<p>Five down, two to go.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2049823.Superior_Saturday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/6-superior-saturday.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I like the visuals around Saturday's realm. It's one of the better ones when it comes to motivation and the idea of a gigantic clockwork tower stretching upwards... cool.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we saw even less of Saturday than we did of Friday, which is saying something. I think she and Arthur were in the same scene for maybe a half dozen paragraphs? It's a bit weird. I assume we'll see more of her in the next book, but it's something of a departure.</p>
<p>Back on Earth, things continue to escalate. Did Nix really <spoiler>drop a nuke on the city?</spoiler> Looks like. It's an interesting move. I'm betting time travel shenanigans will be involved in the finale.</p>
<p>Speaking of the finale, the Will still hasn't caused nearly as much trouble as I expected. It keeps building up and then... nothing. At least nothing big. Another for Sunday I guess.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6657648-lord-sunday"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/07/the-keys-to-the-kingdom/7-lord-sunday.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Overall, everything I was hoping for in an ending to the series.</p>
<p>We get to see a lot of Sunday and Sunday's realm: the Incomparable Gardens. It makes as much sense as anything in the rest of the House, so just go with it.</p>
<p>There's a lot of action, more than any previous book.</p>
<p>It's nice to see a bit more development in Leaf and Suzy.</p>
<p>The ending was... weird. Given the rest of the series, perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's not the best thing I read in 2015 (although it currently does hold that title for 2016), but it's still pretty good. I'm glad I got a chance to fit it in.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to take Python's <code>unicodedata</code> module and use that to get the names of characters, then to find those that best match user input. Of course one problem with that is that as of version 8 of the Unicode specification there are up to 263,994 characters defined in 262 different blocks. That's a bit much.</p>
<p>So instead, I'm going to select a handpicked list of blocks that I think might be vaguely interesting (see <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/uni#L284">here</a>) as a default and add the ability to select any other block as a command line switch:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ uni --block currency euro
€	euro sign
₠	euro-currency sign</code></pre>
<p>So, how do I do it? First, let's assume I have a list of unicode blocks defined as such (available from the Unicode Consortium: <a href="ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/8.0.0/ucd/Blocks.txt">Blocks.txt</a>):</p>
<pre class="text"><code>0000..007F; Basic Latin
0080..00FF; Latin-1 Supplement
0100..017F; Latin Extended-A
0180..024F; Latin Extended-B
0250..02AF; IPA Extensions
...</code></pre>
<p>First, we'll want to either determine which block(s) we'll be looking at:</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Determine which unicode blocks we'll be searching through
blocks = []

if args.block:
    for line in all_blocks.split('\n'):
        if fuzz.token_set_ratio(args.block, line.split('; ')[-1]) &gt; 100 * args.block_threshold:
            blocks.append(line)
else:
    blocks = default_blocks.split('\n')

if not blocks:
    sys.stderr.write('No blocks found\n')
    sys.exit(-1)</code></pre>
<p><code>args</code> contains the parsed command line parameters, I'll get to that later. <code>fuzz</code> is from the <a href="https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy">fuzzywuzzy</a> Python library for fuzzy string matching. Basically, if the <code>--block</code> parameter was specified, we'll search for any that match closely enough, otherwise we'll use the default blocks.</p>
<p>Next, we'll look through and build a list of all possible matching characters within those blocks. Given the formats above, we can get the lower and upper bounds with <code>int</code>, specifying base 16 and then use <code>unicodedata</code> to get the character name. Again, we'll apply a fuzzy match to the character names.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Search through all of those blocks, whee
results = []

for block in blocks:
    bounds, name = block.split('; ')
    lower_bound, upper_bound = bounds.split('..')

    lower_bound = int(lower_bound, 16)
    upper_bound = int(upper_bound, 16)

    for codepoint in range(lower_bound, upper_bound + 1):
        try:
            character = chr(codepoint)
            name = unicodedata.name(character, None).lower()
            score = fuzz.token_set_ratio(args.name, name)

            if score &gt; 100 * args.name_threshold:
                results.append((score, name, character))
        except:
            pass

if not results:
    sys.stderr.write('No characters found\n')
    sys.exit(-1)</code></pre>
<p>And after that, we have a few tweaks for output. We can print all of the results (default) or just a limited number and we can print just the character or also the name:</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Only print out the requested number of results
for count, (score, name, character) in enumerate(sorted(results)):
    if args.count and count &gt;= args.count:
        break

    if args.quiet:
        print(character)
    else:
        print(character, name, sep = '\t')</code></pre>
<p>I guess now would be a good time to go back to how we got the <code>args</code> object in the first place:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>parser = argparse.ArgumentParser('Search unicode characters')
parser.add_argument('name', nargs = '+', help = ...)
parser.add_argument('--block', '-b', help = ...)
parser.add_argument('--block-threshold', default = 0.9, help = ...)
parser.add_argument('--name-threshold', default = 0.9, help = ...)
parser.add_argument('--count', default = 0, type = int, help = ...)
parser.add_argument('--quiet', '-q', default = False, action = 'store_true', help = ...)
args = parser.parse_args()</code></pre>
<p><code>argparse</code> is a most excellent library. It allows you to declaratively specify what your command line parameters will be and then will parse it into an object with one field for each variable (fixing the names so that <code>--block-threshold</code> becomes <code>args.block_threshold</code>).</p>
<p>And that's it. You can use it to look up all sorts of interesting things:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>uni --count 10 --block runic runic

ᛮ	runic arlaug symbol
ᛰ	runic belgthor symbol
᛭	runic cross punctuation
ᚪ	runic letter ac a
ᚫ	runic letter aesc
ᛉ	runic letter algiz eolhx
ᚨ	runic letter ansuz a
ᛒ	runic letter berkanan beorc bjarkan b
ᛍ	runic letter c
ᛣ	runic letter calc</code></pre>
<p>(That will display better if you're using a font that includes Unicode range <code>16A0..16FF; Runic</code>.)</p>
<p>For the most part, I'll use it in this mode and then select characters to copy and paste. But you could also combine it with <a href="https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta">selecta</a> and <code>pbcopy</code> (on OSX) to get something entirely more interesting:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ uni --block runic runic | selecta | cut -f 1 | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy</code></pre>
<p><code>uni</code> will display a list of characters, <code>selecta</code> will let you search for one, <code>cut</code> will get just the character, <code>tr</code> will remove the newline, and <code>pbcopy</code> will send it to the clipboard. You could even shove it into a Bash/ZSH alias:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>pbuni() {
    uni $@ | selecta | cut -f 1 | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy
}</code></pre>
<p>Very cool.</p>

<p>How about this:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ emoji chicken
🐔

$ emoji "which came first, the @emoji{:chicken:} or the :egg:"
which came first, the 🐔 or the 🍳</code></pre>
<!--more-->
<p>To start off, I'm going to use the data from muan's emojilib on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/muan/emojilib/">github:muan/emojilib</a>. Specifically, their list of keywords that relate to any given emoji: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muan/emojilib/master/emojis.json">emojis.json</a><span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>We'll fetch that file if we haven't before and otherwise use a locally cached version:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>cache_path = os.path.expanduser('~/.emoji.json')
remote_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muan/emojilib/master/emojis.json'

if not os.path.exists(cache_path):
    with open(cache_path, 'w') as fout:
        response = requests.get(remote_url)
        fout.write(response.text)

with open(cache_path, 'r') as fin:
    emoji = json.load(fin)</code></pre>
<p>After that, there are two different ways that we can look up Emoji. We can either look them up by a semi official name or by keyword. This function will search through the both, matching on names first and then falling back to the first which matches the given keyword (this script isn't designed to return choices for emoji, but rather just choose the first one that fits; because a Python <code>dict</code> isn't ordered, this is actually non-deterministic):</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def emoji_by_keyword(keyword):
    if keyword in emoji:
        return emoji[keyword]['char']

    for name in emoji:
        if name == 'keys':
            continue

        if keyword in emoji[name]['keywords']:
            return emoji[name]['char']

    return keyword</code></pre>
<p>Following that, we can use regular expressions (the <code>re</code> module) to replace emoji in a string--if they're set off <code>:emoji:</code> style (a la GitHub):</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def emojify(string):
    return re.sub(
        r'\:(\w+)\:',
        lambda m : emoji_by_keyword(m.group(1)),
        string
    )</code></pre>
<p>That's a neat trick that I use from time to time: the second argument to <code>re.sub</code> can be either a literal string or a function. If it's the latter, it's given the match object for each replacement, which we can then pass along to <code>emoji_by_keyword</code>.</p>
<p>And finally, let's mess with some command line arguments:</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Run replacement mode on stdin if no parameters
if len(sys.argv) == 1:
    for line in sys.stdin:
        print(emojify(line[:-1]))

# Othwise, run through the list
else:
    for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
        if ':' in arg:
            print(emojify(arg), end = ' ')
        else:
            print(emoji_by_keyword(arg), end = ' ')</code></pre>
<p>There are three modes we can be operating in:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>stdin</code> mode, where we will read text from <code>stdin</code> and replace any <code>:emoji:</code> blocks with the corresponding emoji</li>
    <li>String mode, where we find any <code>:emoji:</code> in each argument in each input and replace them</li>
    <li>Single lookup mode, where we look up each argument as an individual emoji keyword, without the need for <code>:</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And, that's it.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ emoji fireworks fireworks fireworks

<p>Let's do it!</p>
<p>Essentially, I'm going to write a Javascript userscript, compatible with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en">Tampermonkey</a> for Chrome. Either allows you to insert small bits of Javascript into web pages to modify their behavior.</p>
<p>After digging around a bit in the structure of Gmail's message pages, here's roughly what I ended up with:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>var checkForPlaintexts = function(evt) {
    jQuery('span[download_url]').each(function(i, el) {
        var parts = el.getAttribute('download_url').split(':');
        if (!parts || parts[0] != 'text/plain') return;
        var url = parts[3];

        var newElement = jQuery('&lt;pre id="GPTI_' + i + '"&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;');
        newElement.text('Loading: ' + url);

        jQuery(el).replaceWith(newElement);
        jQuery.ajax({
            url: url,
            success: function(data) {
                newElement.text(data);
            }
        });
    });
};</code></pre>
<p>Basically, we're going to look for a <code>span</code> containing a <code>download_url</code> attribute. For the moment at least, that's always present with attachments and not otherwise. If you take that <code>download_url</code> element, you get something like this:</p>
<p><code>text/plain:text_0.txt:https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=...</code>`</p>
<p>The first part is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME_type">MIME type</a>--of which, we're only interested in plaintext. The last section is a URL under gmail which, when visited, contains the contents of the attachment.</p>
<p>Now that I have that (via jQuery<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></span><span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></span>), I build a new <code>pre</code> element with the text content and shove it in place.</p>
<p>Voila.</p>
<p>All I have to do next is make sure that it's called when I either load the page or when I navigate from the Inbox (et al) to a message:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>jQuery(window).bind('hashchange', checkForPlaintexts);
jQuery(checkForPlaintexts);</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, this has some issues as well. It works if the message has already been viewed once, but not on the first load. Basically, I'm running into timing issues.</p>
<p>My original solution to this was to put in a quick delay and call it a day. Unfortunately, when using satellite internet... even that didn't work. So instead, I built a system that will delay the initial call and then--if it fails--try a few more times with increasing timeouts between then.</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>var delayedEvent = function(f, timeout, retries) {
    timeout = timeout || 0;
    retries = retries || 0;

    return function(evt) {
        setTimeout(f, timeout, evt, retries, timeout * 2);
    }
};

var checkForPlaintexts = function(evt, retries, delay) {
    retries = retries || 0;
    var foundOne = false;

    jQuery('span[download_url]').each(function(i, el) {
        foundOne = true;

        ...
    });

    if (!foundOne && retries) {
        setTimeout(checkForPlaintexts, delay, evt, retries - 1, delay * 2);
    }
};

jQuery(window).bind('hashchange', delayedEvent(checkForPlaintexts, 125, 3));
jQuery(delayedEvent(checkForPlaintexts, 125, 3));</code></pre>
<p>So far, this has worked perfectly. Sometimes it takes a bit to fetch the ajax call in the background. That's why I put in the <code>Loading...</code> notification to tell the user it was working.</p>
<p>It's been a little while since I last wrote a userscript (pre-Chrome, to give you an idea). I forgot how much fun it can be to mess with websites a bit like that. I may write up a few more.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see the entire source (includes some debug messaging and the userscript header comments), you can do so on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/userscripts/blob/master/gmail-plaintext-inline.user.js">gmail-plaintext-inline.user.js</a></p>
<p>If you want to install it directly (and have Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey installed), you can directly from GitHub as well: <a href="https://github.com/jpverkamp/userscripts/raw/master/gmail-plaintext-inline.user.js">install gmail-plaintext-inline.user.js</a>.</p>
<p>As a side note, 'optional' parameters in Javascript are weird...</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>2016 Reading List</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/01/01/2016-reading-list" /><id>urn:uuid:84512a8b-25fc-f25d-17ed-0184a6e249e9</id><updated>2016-01-01T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I enjoyed keeping public track of my <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a>, so here's the same thing for 2016:</p>

<p>20 series this year, compared to 24 from last year. I have a few re-reads in here (Mistborn and Mercy Thompson) along with a nice pile of new books. All told, I'm aiming for 52 books this year--one per week.</p>

<p>For the longest time, I was average right at 100 pages per day, but over the last week or so (in a last burst to finish the year), that bumped up slightly. I ended up at an average of 104 pages / day. None too shabby.</p>
<p>Rating-wise, I rated a full quarter of the books I read 5 out of 5. Less than 20 were three stars or less. My average rating was 4.2. If that sounds a bit high... it should be. These are the books that I put on my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> list since I wanted to read them. Of those, I took the subset of those that I particularly wanted to read for 2015. So it's no surprise that I (for the most part) selected books I thought I would like.</p>
<p>From my original list (<a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a>), I at least started every series (Mere Christianity I'm reading at two chapters per week, so I'm still working on it). I even added a few that weren't originally on there:</p>

<p>Overall, I greatly enjoyed reading as much as I did. According to Goodreads, I only read 10 in 2014. Perhaps though, I should aim for something in between those two... Look tomorrow for my 2016 reading list.</p>

<p>So... The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40853-necroscope">Necroscope</a> series by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20602.Brian_Lumley">Brian Lumley</a>.</p>
<p>I don't know if I've ever read anything in quite this genre before. It's basically urban fantasy, except set during the Cold War (which makes some sense, given this book was released in 1986) and with an extra helping of espionage (ESPionage) thrown in. It's an interesting change and the two styles complement one another.</p>
<p>The world building is neat, especially around the vampires. I like how this universe handles them. The prose itself is a bit strange at times (Lumley really likes exclamation points), but certainly readable. The contents veered well into horror at times, which isn't always my cup of tea--especially towards the end. Overall, I liked the first three a lot and the last two were worth finishing for completion's sake. I'll definitely be taking a break before (if) I start the next Necroscope series though.</p>

<p>And now, the individual reviews. As is often the case, the individual reviews for later books will almost certainly spoil earlier ones (and at points, minor spoilers for the books themselves). Read at your own peril.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66655.Necroscope"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/29/necroscope/1-necroscope.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I don't know if I've read many books where the first two chapters go quite so strongly back and forth between this is cool and that's gross. It evened out a bit over the course of the book, but there was still a good amount of each.</p>
<p>The basic world building takes our own world and adds a bunch of ESPers on top; with ESPers being a general term for all sorts of supernatural power. We see people that can read minds, ones that can see far away events, and those that can speak with the dead (in two different flavors). It's an interesting sort of world and somehow manages not actually to feel too kitchen-sinky, which is a general problem in urban fantasy. Also, there are vampires. I have a feeling we'll be learning a bit more about them later, but so far I'm cautiously intrigued by this particular interpretation. They're weird and alien, which is neat.</p>
<p>One oddity with the book comes with the main character's abilities--that of a Necroscope. The basic idea is that he can speak with the dead and learn from / gain their abilities. It's a cool power, although in the last ten percent of the story it gets insanely powerful. I'm not sure how there can be a sequel, let alone a dozen of them. I'm curious to find out though.</p>
<p>Structurally, there's a framing story taking place in the present, telling the story that actually takes place throughout the past many years. In addition, we follow a few different viewpoints (following at least two main characters). It's a bit confusing at first, but started to gel for me about a quarter of the way through the story. There is at least one interesting twist that the frame allows, so I appreciate that.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the phrasing and especially the punctuation that interrupted my reading. I don't know if I've read a novel with quite so many ellipses and exclamation points. It's not a deal breaker, but it's weird.</p>
<p>Overall, worth the read and I'll check out the sequels. At the very least, I want to know how in the world their going to deal with such radical events for both main characters during the ending...</p>

<p>So that's how the series will continue.</p>
<p>Basically, we get a bit more of Harry who is now sharing bodies with his infant son (it's about that weird) and communicating with the now dead main characters from the first book.</p>
<p>The world building continues to be one of the stronger parts of these books. This time around, we have a fair chunk of the book from the view point of two of the old vampires (Thibor and Faethor Ferenczy), including a look at how they were turned and what they did over their centuries of life. It's an interesting take of vampires, and I continue to want to want to know more about that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Harry's plotline and the moebius continuum remain weird. I think Lumley wrote himself into a bit of a whole introducing all of that at the end of the first book. Teleportation and time travel, essentially for free? Too powerful. Sanderson's Second Law: Limitations > Powers. It doesn't ruin the book by any means, but I think they could be stronger without.</p>
<p>The other present timeline follows Yulian Bodescu, another of Thibor's offspring (I thought vampires could only have one true offspring in this universe? I guess Yulian is something new). It's certainly an interesting story, if rather dark and probably could have carried the novel by itself. It didn't mesh particularly well with the flashbacks to the Ferenczys history though. They just didn't overly relate.</p>
<p>On the whole, an interesting read. Enough to keep me going on the series.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/636742.Necroscope_III"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/29/necroscope/3-the-source.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The Source follows a nuclear accident that manages to blow a hole in between our reality and the homeworld (more accurately home universe, since Harry cannot Moebius his way there) of the Vampires.</p>
<p>It's interesting watching this series progress from espionage mixed with urban fantasy and horror in the first book to a more historical urban fantasy (if that makes sense) to this one which veers a bit more into almost science fiction. We have a parallel universe, a tidally locked planet, and some really weird vampire biology. The world building around vampires continues to be the strongest part of this series (which is amusing, given that I find the Moebius Continuum and the various ESP powers to be among the weakest).</p>
<p>I'm still not particularly a fan of Harry Keogh, but for most of the book he has a relatively minor role and I like a lot of the new characters in this book. Overall, I liked to see the extra worldbuilding, but the story was a bit weaker. Given the conclusion, I can guess where the next book is going to go (Harry Sr vs Harry Jr). We'll give it a chance.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1063378.Necroscope_IV"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/29/necroscope/4-deadspeak.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Oh hey, turns out there is another Ferenczy. Or rather, that's what a lot of this book felt like. Don't get me wrong, it's interesting to fill out a few more of the possibilities of what might happen if a vampire spawns a mostly human child who then desperately tries to learn to be a Vampire. But at the same time, it's starting to feel like the same story again, just with different players.</p>
<p>Another twist this time, which I at first appreciated was that Harry has lost his powers (stolen from him by Harry Jr). So for a large chunk of the story, he cannot speak to the dead except in dreams--which he doesn't remember upon waking--and cannot access the Moebius Continuum at all. Given how often I've complained about how overpowerful the latter made him, I thought it would be good for him to lose the power, but of course I guessed he would at some point get it back. And just in time for the final battle too, making it feel like an echo of the final battle from Necroscope I. So it goes.</p>
<p>Also this one really played up the more sexual aspects of the story. They were already there in the previous books, but relatively minor and sort of out of the way. Not so much in Deadspeak. Several incidents certainly play into the horror aspect of things and for that I applaud them, but it's starting to get a bit ridiculous.</p>
<p>Overall, it's still an interesting enough entry to the series and worth reading for completion's sake. Likewise I'll read the fifth and final Necroscope for the same reason. Plus I am vaguely curious how Harry ended up with a bit of vampire in his soul after all...</p>

<p>I think I'm done with the Necroscope series, at least for the time being. And hey, technically this <em>is</em> the end of the first Necroscope series.</p>
<p>On the negative side:</p>
<p>This feels like 2 or 3 novels shoved together. There's the parts on Earth where Harry tracks down a serial killer. Then there are the Wamphyri in exile in the Icelands and what they find there. Then finally, there's Harry in the Vampire world and the final showdown. It all more or less comes together at the end, but switching back and forth was a bit rough.</p>
<p>The horror, especially around the serial killer plot line, just got too horrific for me. It certainly works as a shock factor I guess.</p>
<p>The relationship (as it was) between Penny and Harry was weird, abrupt, and ugly. Especially in how it ended. And I don't feel like it actually needed to be there for the story to progress as is it did.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Harry went dark. Given how too-good he was before, I thought a turn as anti-hero would be nice. It wasn't. It felt completely out of character for Harry. More in line for a vampire, but it's not what I was wanting to read in that character.</p>
<p>The sex scene with Lady Karen was ... weird. It certainly fits the horror scenes of the world, but I feel like I'm going to read a palette cleaner after this.</p>
<p>On the positive side:</p>
<p>I still really do like the world building around vampires in this world. They're actually horrific and alien, but with related aspects from their former human lives. All together, that seems something less common in modern vampire literature, so it's nice to see here. This was even better and weirder this time around, especially with some of the ancient ones come back.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think it's time for something lighter.</p>
<p>Well, that finishes my original <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/01/01/2015-reading-list">2015 Reading List</a> (with the exception of Mere Christianity; that one is still in progress).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I'm still 2 books shy of my 100 book goal, so I think I'll start <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8347.Garth_Nix">Garth Nix's</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/42967-the-keys-to-the-kingdom">Keys to the Kingdom</a> series. From what I've been told, they're a bit lighter (everything is relative) and quick reads. I should be able to knock out two of them in the two days and change before the end of the year. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Advent of Code: Day 25</title><link href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/25/advent-of-code-day-25" /><id>urn:uuid:76fab82b-01da-119f-da63-b163c5d488e0</id><updated>2015-12-25T00:00:00Z</updated><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://adventofcode.com/day/25">Source</a></p>
