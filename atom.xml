&lt;p>Bit more traditional super hero flare, but still with a Runaways twist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s a big bad in the future and our intrepid heroes(ish) have to find him as a teenager and … deal with him. Because that worked out so well the last two times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus all sorts of b-tier / c-tier hero cameos… I have no idea which of these were made up for this story and which have decades long comics ruins of their own. And some rather higher level villains about. Now that was a surprise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fun ride.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s not entirely the same thing at all&amp;ndash;fantasy rather than science fiction, with a world full of floating eyes and many different sapient races rather than aliens and murderbots&amp;ndash;but there are some bones that aren&amp;rsquo;t too dissimilar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, you have Moon. He&amp;rsquo;s a Raksura, a being capable of transforming between a more or less human form (although I don&amp;rsquo;t get the feeling there are any real &amp;lsquo;humans&amp;rsquo; in this book) and a much larger stronger winged form. He&amp;rsquo;s all on his own, not even sure what he is&amp;ndash;or where he fits in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which of course goes badly when the people he&amp;rsquo;s staying with think he&amp;rsquo;s Fell (winged &amp;rsquo;evil&amp;rsquo; creatures; I&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that). And much better when another Raksura finds him and brings him back. And worse again when it turns out they don&amp;rsquo;t want him either. And better again when, of course, he saves the day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Genuary 2023.25: Yayoi Kusama</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/25/genuary-2023.25-yayoi-kusama/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/25/genuary-2023.25-yayoi-kusama/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“Like the Saint says, if you don’t have anything to say, you might scare your flightleader into thinking you’re dead.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The one with Jerkface and the Kitsen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like all of the Starsight novellas, we have a focus on what else has been going on while Spena has been doing her &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/19/cytonic/">Cytonic&lt;/a> things. This time&amp;ndash;as you might guess&amp;ndash;with Jerkface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s actually really great to see his point of view and especially to see just how much he&amp;rsquo;s grown throughout the books. He was always a leader, but he&amp;rsquo;s really coming into it now&amp;ndash;and really realizing that sometimes, just maybe, the books might be &lt;em>wrong&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do also love seeing more of the Kitsen. They&amp;rsquo;re really building up a regular anti-Superiority alliance there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the biggest bummer now is having to wait for Defiant to come out this November&amp;hellip; Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Runaways, Vol. 3: The Good Die Young</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/25/runaways-vol.-3-the-good-die-young/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/25/runaways-vol.-3-the-good-die-young/</guid><description>&lt;p>Finally getting some answers!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>From a modern, American, middle-class point of view, the idea of the early 1900s British Aristocracy is just so strange. They do next nothing (useful) and have an entire staff to support it. The entire estate could go to a cousin they&amp;rsquo;d never met and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing they can do about it &amp;hellip; is so strange.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yet&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s oddly charming?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Grantham&amp;rsquo;s are fascinating. Sybil seems good people, Edith is certainly going to figure out how to come into her own, Mary is spoiled and needlessly cruel&amp;ndash;but may be learning. Lord and Lady Grantham are fun, if somewhat alien&amp;ndash;and I do love watching Lord Grantham try and completely fail to wrangle three young adult daughters. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The shining jewel of the family Dame Maggie Smith&amp;rsquo;s Dowager Countess of Grantham. Oh she&amp;rsquo;s just wonderful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Among the staff, you have a whole &amp;rsquo;nother level of politics. They&amp;rsquo;re all great and terrible (as they should be) and there are every bit as many problems and politics as there are among the &amp;lsquo;family&amp;rsquo;. Turns out people are people no matter how much money they have or do not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man that&amp;rsquo;s a crazy amount to fit into seven episodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward&amp;hellip; to war!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Runaways, Vol. 2: Teenage Wasteland</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/24/runaways-vol.-2-teenage-wasteland/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/24/runaways-vol.-2-teenage-wasteland/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/runaways-v2-505090.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And so the team grows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They’re so amusingly teenager. Angst and boy / girl issues contrasting against their parents trying to find / capture / kill then. Good times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s fun watching them try to grow up fast. I have no idea how they end up getting out of this mess… or what their parents are really up to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which is the best part!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Genuary 2023.24: Textile</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/24/genuary-2023.24-textile/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/24/genuary-2023.24-textile/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But the truth was, I didn’t feel accepted. I didn’t feel acknowledged for my service in raising the next generation, for my active role in the community, or even for being human sometimes. I felt utterly ignored. I felt invisible or, worse, frowned upon. Most of the time, when I looked in the mirror, I saw only my flaws. I saw all the things that advertisements and social media said was wrong with me. I wanted to focus on what was right about this version of myself, like the way I’d learned to take life a little slower and enjoy each moment. Like my appreciation for people’s differences, and for beauty found in unlikely places. For my friendships, new and old. I wanted it to be okay that I wasn’t worried about beauty anymore, or worried about looking young. I just wanted to look like me, however me looked in any given year.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Take your normal urban fantasy fair: our world, but with a few twists&amp;ndash;gargoyles for one, this time. Add in your &amp;rsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; point of view about to get their world rocked. This time around make them a 40 year old woman recently gone through a divorce. Make sure that none of this really gets moving until the last third or so of the book (better if you&amp;rsquo;re going to read the whole series I suppose).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Magical Midlife Madness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s fine and I expect there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more to like about the rest of the series, but to me the entire thing just sort of existed. Not that much happened, there was entirely too much wish fulfillment, and too much focus on &amp;lsquo;it&amp;rsquo;s okay to be 40&amp;rsquo; (which it totally is, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, just not chapters and chapters worth).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not a bad book. It&amp;rsquo;s not the kind of book for me. I won&amp;rsquo;t be reading the rest of the series. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Genuary 2023.23: Moiré</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/23/genuary-2023.23-moir%C3%A9/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/23/genuary-2023.23-moir%C3%A9/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Eratos wasn’t the only dying world, just the one dying fastest—the tiny colony on Samos had been gone for a decade, and after Eratos would be Hypatia and then Gan-De, and maybe the Inner Ring would finally come to care when it was their turn to freeze to death as the sun collapsed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A leisurely extinction. One that allowed everyone to push any inconvenience to another place or another generation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The Vela is part of a fascinating sort of new/old model: serialized fiction. In this case &lt;a href="https://www.realm.fm/">Realm.fm (formerly Serial Box)&lt;/a> is putting out piles of audio fiction by a number of well known authors chapter by chapter. And yet&amp;hellip; somehow I read the ebook version from the library. I really should check out the audio versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, The worldbuilding (as in the above quote) in the Vela is fascinating. A nearish-future tech sci-fi universe where humanity has managed to extract enough resources from the local star to freeze out the outer planets, wrecking all manner of havoc among the people that live out there. There&amp;rsquo;s all manner of classism, racism, and other racisms to digest&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Set against the backdrop of a missing starship (the Vela) and the two unlikely companions (Asala and Niko) who are sent to go find it. I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see Becky Chambers as one of the authors here, I really love how she does &amp;lsquo;people stories&amp;rsquo;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet read the other three authors, but they&amp;rsquo;re all on my to-read shelf already and higher up now. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The relationship between Asala (hard bitten mercenary/sniper) and Nike (child of the president; hacker) throughout the stories is really the shining jewel of the series. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see the slight (IMO) variations between how the different authors see and write them, but it&amp;rsquo;s still well worth reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well well worth a read. Or a listen. And Season 2 is on Realm? Onward!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>People spoke about the death of planets as if the rock itself would shatter, but the truth was never so dramatic. The entire sphere wasn&amp;rsquo;t in danger of ceasing to exist. All that mattered was the inner goings-on of that tiny strip of gauze, that onion skin of atmosphere clinging to the rocky surface like morning dew. The narrowest of margins on which everything depended.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A truly odd story of two women hunting. I … don’t actually know so they are in the original continuity. So I’m not sure what changes here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Various panels making our clear that the characters are aware of our time and that they aren’t in it… is an odd choice. Related to the above perhaps?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The art changes style from part to part and some of it absolutely gorgeous in a haunting sort of way, other parts oddly surreal.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Stories say something. About us, and about where we came from. They’re a reminder that we have a past, a history. And a future.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that was certainly a thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2019/02/28/skyward/">Skyward&lt;/a> introduced us to some far future humans trapped on a planet by terrifying aliens. Spensa learns how to fight, teachers her friends and allies how to be awesome, and saves the day from the aliens!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/26/starsight/">Starsight&lt;/a>, we get off world. We&amp;rsquo;re introduced us to some of those same aliens. Turns out they&amp;rsquo;re people, more or less just like us. So Spensa learns how to spy, teachers her new friends and allies how to be awesome, and saves the day from the Eldrich Horrors From Beyond Space!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So of course in Cytonic&amp;hellip; Spensa goes Beyond Space. She adventures through all manners of weird environments, meets a bunch of Pirates From Beyond Space&amp;hellip; And learns to fight, teachers her friends and allies how to be awesome, and saves the universe?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m starting to sense a pattern here.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>All people must accept that we have the potential to do terrible things. It is part of seeing our place in the universe, our heritage, and our natures. But in that acceptance we gain strength, for potential can be refused. Any hero who could have been a monster is more heroic for the choices he or she made to walk another road.&lt;/p>

The 1602 Master Spider of course, but also Lord Iron, Master Jameson and his broadsheet, and, of course, the Hulk—who needs no puny time periodic appropriate name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It feels like somewhat smaller a story than the original 1602 and more like we’re reading something that we’ve seen before, just with a new coat of paint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still fun though.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s perfect for a brian like main that loves to build things up, solve problems, and make things work. Perhaps too perfect. To date, I&amp;rsquo;ve put almost 2000 hours into the game over a number of runs, getting more complicated each time. Most recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve started a heavily modded run based around Space Exploration (adds planets!), Krastorio2 (designed to work with SE, think of it as Factorio++), LTN (automatic trains), Rampant (better enemies, although disabled on Nauvis), and the entire Brevven suite of a half dozen additional materials. If you&amp;rsquo;d like a full list of mods, I&amp;rsquo;ve included one &lt;a href="#mods">at the end of this post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It should be fun. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I figured this time around, I should actually post my progress. Probably not straight up videos, although that&amp;rsquo;s a possibility at some point, but rather screenshots and perhaps a few short clips. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, take a look, drop me a line. I&amp;rsquo;d love to chat about it. If not, just skip over it. This is as much for me (supplemental memory go!) as anything. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="factorio.gif" alt="A gif">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s it just so much fun to watch?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Spend a month making one beautiful thing per day, given a bunch of prompts. A month late, but as they say, &amp;rsquo;the second best time is now'.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s do it!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="12-tessellation">12) Tessellation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Wikipedia: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation">Tessellation&lt;/a>
(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">List&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was not at all the direction I ended to go, but it got really interesting, so I decided to keep it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I remember doing years and years ago, I think roughly around the time of Windows 95 (I feel old) or perhaps even pre-Windows was using a tesselation program that would give you a basic shape and then allow you to pull the edges in a way it would propagate to automatically keep the tesselation valid. It was pretty awesome&amp;hellip; but I have no idea what it was called any more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It might have been &lt;a href="http://www.tessellations.org/software-shodor.shtml">Shodor on Tessellations.org&lt;/a>, or perhaps &lt;a href="http://www.tessellations.org/software-tesselmania0.shtml">TesselMania!&lt;/a>. Been a while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, enjoy!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s a neat story, finishing up the story of Project Communion from volume 5, digging into how very much baggage both Hawkeyes carry, and really giving their working together a chance to (eventually) shine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed it.&lt;/p>

5) Debug view I like Boids. Here are some Boids with debug vectors drawn showing the three forces acting on them (red to stay away from one another, green to move in the same direction as their friends, blue to move towards the center of their friends).</description></item><item><title>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/04/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 23:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/04/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that’s quite the thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They couldn’t/didn’t get the rights to the third age, so instead we get much older stories. Stories after the fall of Morgoth but still during the end of the era of Elves and Númenor. Before the rise of the kingdoms of Men.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s a lot crammed into eight episodes. One might argue too much. Leaves some stories a bit thin. But really, having seen them, I don’t know what I’d cut.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a watch. Looking forward to season two!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Redis in Rust: An Echo Server [Part 2]</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/04/redis-in-rust-an-echo-server-part-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/04/redis-in-rust-an-echo-server-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Following up from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/31/cloning-redis-in-rust-resp-part-1/">Cloning Redis in Rust: RESP [Part 1]&lt;/a>, we can parse the protocol. So now&amp;hellip; let&amp;rsquo;s do something with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The obvious(ish) next step, in my mind? Make a server. It&amp;rsquo;s all going to be over the network eventually, so it&amp;rsquo;s either here or storing data. Here it is!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Specifically, my goal is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> to build the networking and data structures for this project from scratch. Where there are primitives or libraries that will do something like networking for me, I&amp;rsquo;m going to use them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ergo:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/">&lt;code>tokio&lt;/code>&lt;/a> for networking (+ async)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/">&lt;code>tracing&lt;/code>&lt;/a> for logging&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, how do I write a simple server in Tokio?&lt;/p>

The implication that S.H.I.E.L.D. isn’t really much better than H.Y.D.R.A. sometimes. Hawkeyes!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a solid mostly self contained adventure. I enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not a huge fan of the pastel flashbacks. Hard to read at best. The story is neat—origin story!—but I want to skip it just because of the style.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ReDawn</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/04/redawn/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/04/redawn/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A prisoner could be convinced that they lived in a paradise, if the prison was pretty enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>ReDawn is a lot like &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/29/sunreach/">Sunreach&lt;/a> in that it&amp;rsquo;s a cousin to the main Skyward books, really expanding the universe and letting us know what the rest of Skyward flight (and others) were getting up to while Spensa was&amp;hellip; otherwise occupied.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around&amp;hellip; the point of view is Alanik, the near human alien that crashed into Detritus right at the beginning of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/01/26/starsight/">Starsight&lt;/a>, enabling the events of that book.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I didn’t know enough about human politics to know who was correct, but I did know enough about politics in general to guess that everyone would interpret the law in the way that best suited themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s facinating to have a point of view from someone who grew up in this universe on an alien world (bubbles of air around giant trees!) with an alien culture&amp;ndash;that in this case is actually tied to humanity throughout the past. It gives us a way to dig more into the relationships (especially the &amp;lsquo;relationships&amp;rsquo;) between the humans all the more, which I enjoyed a lot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course&amp;hellip; learning more about the Taynix / slugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty fun story, well worth it&amp;rsquo;s place as a Skyward sidestory novella!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Genuary 2023.03: Glitch art</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/03/genuary-2023.03-glitch-art/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/03/genuary-2023.03-glitch-art/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
