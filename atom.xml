&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“You’re creating hell. And you’re putting yourself inside it.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NEMESIS-1’s tone was serene. “Hell is the optimal solution.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/21/the-outside/">The Outside&lt;/a>, humanity found something Outside of the Gods&amp;rsquo; influence and managed to tear apart a large part of the world of Jai. In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/28/the-fallen/">The Fallen&lt;/a>, they learned to live with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/the-infinite/">The Infinite&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s time to learn more about the Gods themselves&amp;ndash;what they really are and how they came to be&amp;hellip; and perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s time for the Gods&amp;rsquo; reigns to end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating story and, in my opinion, perhaps the best of the trilogy. At once, we get answers for just what lead to the world that the characters live in now&amp;ndash;while at the same time opening so many more questions. What happened in the 700 years between the earliest and latest points of view in the book? What&amp;rsquo;s going on in the rest of the universe? And what happens next?!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But so far as this single story, it&amp;rsquo;s finished and well done. I always do applaud authors able to do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Christmas Treasury</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/christmas-treasury/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/christmas-treasury/</guid><description>&lt;p>Why yes. It is an odd time of year to be reading a Christmas Treasury. But &lt;em>i&lt;/em> has been insisting on stories out of this book over and over again, so I figured I might as well write it down. It&amp;rsquo;s a whole collection of the cute Christmas (or at least Winter) themed stories with the absolutely delightful illustrations that are Jan Brett&amp;rsquo;s trademark.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 8: New Mutants</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/ultimate-x-men-vol.-8-new-mutants/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/ultimate-x-men-vol.-8-new-mutants/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-x-men-v8-fb5799.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things have been rough for the X-Men, what with the whole Magneto thing (again) and anti-Mutant feelings running high. So of course what do we need? More mutants!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Angel. Emma Frost. Dazzler. Alex Summers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s cool to see so many new (old) faces and shake up the status quo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’ll just have to see what’s next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing particularly special about this volume but also not terrible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use of Weapons</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/use-of-weapons/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/04/use-of-weapons/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The way to a man’s heart is through his chest!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Another day, another Culture novel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After how much I liked &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/26/the-player-of-games/">Player of Games&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting how much less I got into Use of Weapons. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s the setting and main character&amp;ndash;Zakalwe is closer to Horza than Gurgeh. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s the structure&amp;ndash;with one set of chapters going forward in time, one going backward, and a prologue and epilogue after either of them, it&amp;rsquo;s complicated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not a bad book. The Culture is a fascinating setting and getting into the darker corners is exactly where you learn the most about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Zakalwe, in all human societies we have ever reviewed, in every age and every state, there has seldom if ever been a shortage of eager young males prepared to kill and die to preserve the security, comfort and prejudices of their elders, and what you call heroism is just an expression of this simple fact; there is never a scarcity of idiots.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Worth reading as a continuation of the Culture, but probably not one I&amp;rsquo;ll revisit. Such is life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 10: Hollywood</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/01/ultimate-spider-man-volume-10-hollywood/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/01/ultimate-spider-man-volume-10-hollywood/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-spider-man-v10-629af4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh my. That’s when we are. This has potential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-spider-man-v10-fbc087.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh yes. That is Toney McGwire and (this real) Spider-Man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea that Octavius is on the run again and that the film crews got it all—and made to use that as footage in the Sam Raimi Spider-Man film? Oh that’s hilarious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus a few more reveals and a bit more with Peter’s classmates. Always good to have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good one.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reed, Sue, Johnny. Ben back at school. The gangs all here!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have to admit, but a branch of the Marvel Universe I’m that familiar with. Looking forward to finding out!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course the first thing that has to happen is the accident…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a bit quick we don’t really get time to even know Reed Richards, let alone the rest of them. I expect they’ll get some time to breathe as the series goes on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise, it’s a weird mix of science and pseudo history. Pretty weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far, I like the X-Men and Spider-Man better. But we’ll see.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Huh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I expected some version of the Sinister Six, but to have it be an Ultimates/Spider-Man crossover? Pretty cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some serious mental issues at play here and only mostly on the villains side. Likewise questionable choices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the good guys all get to go home in the end, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right?&lt;/p>

Much more breathing room last year than the year before (two weeks!) and I&amp;rsquo;ve already been reading more this year, so I&amp;rsquo;m confident. Let&amp;rsquo;s do it.
As a side note, if anyone I know wants to read along on any of these, drop me a line. Love to chat about books. 😄
Rules:
Must be speculative fiction (SF, fantasy, horror with speculative elements) Limit the number of novellas (fewer than 40k words or defined by the author as such) or combine them A book of short stories counts Graphic novels/manga should be treated as novellas Web novels count (if they&amp;rsquo;re long enough) Audiobooks count Official thread</description></item><item><title>[Factorio: SE-K2-BZ; Hours 8-13] Making a bus</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/31/factorio-se-k2-bz-hours-8-13-making-a-bus/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/31/factorio-se-k2-bz-hours-8-13-making-a-bus/</guid><description>&lt;p>You thought I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten, didn&amp;rsquo;t you?

It&amp;rsquo;s quick, doesn&amp;rsquo;t really go anywhere (huge), and is a fun little read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the plus side, I like seeing more of Marigold as the primary point of view. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird to swap, but I think I like her more than Laurel. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because she&amp;rsquo;s just coming into the magical world?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the downside&amp;hellip; the (a?) big bad is maginanotech bugs. And there&amp;rsquo;s really no justification for nanotech just &lt;em>existing&lt;/em> in this world. I generally only like one real &amp;lsquo;give&amp;rsquo; to a story and this is a bit much. Especially when it could totally just be magical and that would be fine. Even magical bioengineering would be better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such is life.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/one-tin-soldier-aa9c84.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And… that’s a backstory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He’s rich and fights crime in a winged outfit. And has an adopted boy sidekick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s cute. The big bad is so weird. The characters are one dimensional and not great people. I’m not really sure why it’s a thing other than a weird Ultimates cameo that doesn’t go anywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>

Fisk is back and of course Spider-Man can’t let that stand. He (Spider-Man) really does need to find a way to deal with him (Kingpin) before he (Spider-Man) ends up dealt with… violently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along the way, we get a bit more humanity from Jameson, a new mysterious (ish) opponent/ally? in Black Cat, and a bit more Elektra. Good times.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Kid friendly graphic novel about a young boy named Jack with a single mother working multiple jobs to keep everything afloat and a non-verbal autistic kid sister (Maddy) that he helps take care of. That&amp;rsquo;s already a bunch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we haven&amp;rsquo;t even gotten to the point where they trade the family car for some magic beans (get it? Jack?), grow a crazy magical farm, befriend homeschooled neighborhood girl Lily, and adventures ensue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a great time and I really do appreciate the increased variety of characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, well worth a read and the children enjoy it as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Fallen</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/28/the-fallen/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/28/the-fallen/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ooh boy. After &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/21/the-outside/">The Outside&lt;/a> set up the world and characters, ending with &amp;rsquo;the Outside&amp;rsquo; coming in and wrecking havoc on the planet Jai, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what was next but I surely wanted to find out&amp;hellip; I even noted in that review that there were sequels, and yet somehow I never got around to reading them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did now. This is a wonderfully weird (at times) ride into what happened next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once again, I think that one thing that the Fallen does well is dealing with all manner of diversity (particularly in the neuro- space). People are people. And it really makes you think: what if we actually could live in a society where people just expect to meet others where they are and &lt;em>that&amp;rsquo;s okay&lt;/em>. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses and things that make their skin crawl. And &lt;em>that&amp;rsquo;s okay&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see a book really dig into that, all along the backdrop of super powerful AI &amp;lsquo;Gods&amp;rsquo;, their Angels (who have issues all thier own), and monsters (who, it turns out, are sometimes people as well, just a fair bit further away from the &amp;rsquo;norm&amp;rsquo;) from outside space and time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a really solid sequel. Honestly, I loved it even more than the first book. Well, well worth a read. I really look forward to what&amp;rsquo;s next.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 7: Blockbuster</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/28/ultimate-x-men-vol.-7-blockbuster/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/28/ultimate-x-men-vol.-7-blockbuster/</guid><description>&lt;p>The one that starts digging into Logan’s issues.

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-x-men-v7-c53993.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good part of the story is Spider-Man and Wolverine teaming up. That’s just wonderful. I really enjoy the contrast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-x-men-v7-fcbbf8.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Daredevil! Even if not much. Good times.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s not hard, but it&amp;rsquo;s something that I really wanted to do and had to look up where it was, so perhaps it will help you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Problem statement:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I run a bunch of local services in my network. They aren&amp;rsquo;t exposed publicly (I use Wireguard to access them when out and about), so I really don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>need&lt;/em> HTTPS. But (rightfully) a number of services behave better when they&amp;rsquo;re behind HTTPS + if there&amp;rsquo;s ever a service that&amp;rsquo;s running amuck (Internet of Things devices?) that&amp;rsquo;s listening, I don&amp;rsquo;t want them to see anything.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="#start-adding-the-certificate">Start adding the certificate&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/nav>
&lt;h2 id="options">Options&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Option 1: Use Nginx Proxy Manager to request certificates for each subdomain. It works quickly and well. Problem: All certificates are published to Certificate Transparency Logs. I don&amp;rsquo;t immediately mind exposing what I&amp;rsquo;m running&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;d still rather now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Option 2: Set up wildcard certificates. This requires integration with your DNS provider (since wildcards need a DNS challenge, not TCP).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course (based on the title), we&amp;rsquo;re going with option 2. 😄&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automated transcripts from video with Whisper(.cpp)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/27/automated-transcripts-from-video-with-whisper.cpp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2023 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/27/automated-transcripts-from-video-with-whisper.cpp/</guid><description>&lt;p>I tend to be something of a digital packrat.

&lt;p>In this post, updating the state to store expiration times + a thread to handle said eviction + the implementation of a small pile more of the general Redis functions.&lt;/p>

Far more than &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/consider-phlebas/">Consider Phlebas&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, the story follows Jernau Gurgeh, one of (if not the) best &amp;lsquo;Player of Games&amp;rsquo; in the entire Culture. We had a hint of how important games could be in Consider Phlebas, with the stakes literally being life and death (although not of the player, /of course/), but here we see it can be so much more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Gurgeh is &lt;em>really&lt;/em> into games.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I get that. I appreciate that. Games have this special spot in the universe. A microcosm of all that can be, following very specific and often completely knowable rules. It&amp;rsquo;s a way to compete (or co-operate (or both)) with other game players, to get to know them and the game you&amp;rsquo;re all playing together. Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s all about winning&amp;hellip; but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s so much more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Gurgeh gets that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So when he&amp;rsquo;s offered (when Special Circumstances offers&amp;hellip; you accept) to travel two years, almost out of the galaxy, to visit an alien empire where there is incredibly complicated thousand year old game that essentially dominates their entire society&amp;ndash;choosing their leaders, guiding their religious views.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, I love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the detail there, but the entire idea that a not entirely likeable (especially at first) player of games can be the protagonist. Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s just lovely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Easily my favorite book of the Culture so far (even if I&amp;rsquo;ve only read the two so far 😄). I really will have to check at the end if it stands up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 6: Return of the King</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/26/ultimate-x-men-vol.-6-return-of-the-king/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2023 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/26/ultimate-x-men-vol.-6-return-of-the-king/</guid><description>&lt;p>Wherein we get this universe’s history. How the a Professor and Magneto started out to build a mutant utopia, how some minor* differences in option came between them, and how Xavier ended up in a wheelchair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a nice longer story and I really do dig the conflict between the Professor and Magneto. There are also some really interesting ideas buried within the action. Ends justifying the means. The cost(s) of rehabilitation or even imprisonment of a super powered prisoner. What it means to be human.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A solid story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 5: Ultimate War</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/25/ultimate-x-men-vol.-5-ultimate-war/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/25/ultimate-x-men-vol.-5-ultimate-war/</guid><description>&lt;p>Magneto is back and &lt;strong>mad&lt;/strong>. The Brotherhood vs the Ultimates! The X-Men are nowhere to be found. At least not ent S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Probably for the best, given the various infighting and differences of opinion in each and every one of these groups. They really do their best to constantly shake up teams in comics, don’t they.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I never really had reason to consider before… you know what Captain America’s shield, Thor’s hammer, and Iron Man’s armor have in common?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They’re all made of metal…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately for all the promises, surprisingly little actually happens. It will be interesting to see what’s next… but something more now would have been nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 4: Hellfire and Brimstone</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/22/ultimate-x-men-vol.-4-hellfire-and-brimstone/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/22/ultimate-x-men-vol.-4-hellfire-and-brimstone/</guid><description>&lt;p>All the fallout and barely time to process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now Jean is having hallucinations and Beast’s new flame is digging for secrets…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quite a ride, setting up all sorts of what’s next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, sudden art shifts yo. I like the new one. Don&amp;rsquo;t think that will ever stop being surprising.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If I were reading this book to my children, I imagine I would have liked it quite a bit more. It&amp;rsquo;s got the zany sort of weirdness that really appeals to children&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s in some ways much easier for them to jump from insane to imaginary, while at the same time not needing &lt;em>that&lt;/em> much of a reason for things to be like they are.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The whole land of Skree was green and flat. Except for the Stony Mountains in the north, which weren’t flat at all. Nor were they green. They were rather white from all the snow, though if the snow melted, something green might eventually grow there.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The entire prologue is like that. Prologue&lt;em>s&lt;/em>. There are 3 of them. And they&amp;rsquo;re all like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s amusing&amp;hellip; and then it&amp;rsquo;s too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>That evil was a nameless evil, an evil whose name was Gnag the Nameless.&lt;/p>

A dash of memory on tape: Peter’s father. And… apparently childhood friend Eddie Brock?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course one thing leads to another, they find the venom formula (SCIENCE this time, not alien; at least not that we know), and we very Venom suit Spider-Man. Only for a few moments and he’s already done with that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a bit quick to go from ‘oh hey, childhood friend you forgot’ to fighting Venom in the street, but I expect we’ll see more of him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus, an aside with Fury! And references to the events of the Ultimates!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 5: Public Scrutiny</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/20/ultimate-spider-man-volume-5-public-scrutiny/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/20/ultimate-spider-man-volume-5-public-scrutiny/</guid><description>&lt;p>Poor Spider-Man. School troubles, girl troubles, and super hero identify struggles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-spider-man-v5-0468c7.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just can’t catch a break.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s nice to have a relatively low level, human story—even if we still absolutely get changes that are going to ripple through the rest of the storyline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Neuromancer</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/20/neuromancer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/20/neuromancer/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s the Matrix decades before the Matrix. Or at least a Matrix?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts&amp;hellip; A graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s cyberpunk in a nutshell. A gritty dark world where computers and virtual worlds play first class. In this case, there&amp;rsquo;s the Matrix. Basically the internet, but with better visuals. And of course, because this was written in the 80s, the only way to access it is jacking in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The terminology is at once futuristic and dated, but there&amp;rsquo;s only so much you can do when you write about &amp;rsquo;near&amp;rsquo; future worlds. Even the better racial stereotype (that&amp;rsquo;s a way to start a sentence&amp;hellip;) are dated if not outright cringe inducing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s mostly an action story. I didn&amp;rsquo;t care much if our protagonist lived or died&amp;hellip; but that&amp;rsquo;s okay, because he&amp;rsquo;s really just a vehicle for the story. Such is life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps my favorite part of the book is the descriptions and characterizations of the AIs. We live in world where AI is advancing in leaps and bounds, doing things AI creators in the 80s wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have imagined possible, while at the same time proving just how hard a problem it still is. In the case of Neuromancer though, the AIs feel almost Urban Fantasy style Fae. Alien, at a totally different scale, and terrifying. It works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not my favorite entry even into this sub-genre, but it&amp;rsquo;s also not at all a bad book. Worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Keyboard Chords with Hammerspoon</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/19/keyboard-chords-with-hammerspoon/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2023 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/19/keyboard-chords-with-hammerspoon/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love keyboard shortcuts.

&lt;p>Nick Fury is on the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s good, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The conflict between the Osborns, the anguish of Parker’s lives tearing him apart. It’s a solid story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The one bit left, I’m not sure what’s going on with the Gwen story line. Don’t do it Peter. Choose MJ!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Lol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He’s so young.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here we have them introductions of Gwen Stacy and Eddie Brock, Doc Oc—back from the dead, Kong being not quite so dumb as everyone thinks—but no one believes him, and… for some reason a guy in a fur cloak wants to hunt Spider-Man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel like these are by far the best paced of the Ultimate Marvel Universe comics so far. Plenty of action, but also time to see Parker being a kid, working a job, and introducing new characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m looking forward to what’s next!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Ultimates, Volume 2: Homeland Security</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/16/the-ultimates-volume-2-homeland-security/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/16/the-ultimates-volume-2-homeland-security/</guid><description>&lt;p>The one where we process the fallout from the first volume. Hulk on a murderous rampage. Hank Pym’s domestic abuse. Hard topics and certainly worthy of discussion…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just kidding. Invasion of the shape shifting Nazi aliens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As one does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s another intense story line and maybe actually shaking up a few things. I really am curious how they’ll continue to deal with Banner and Pym. Slowly I expect. But that works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also: The fact that in this continuity, Thor is thought crazy is thoroughly amusing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Ultimates, Volume 1: Super-Human</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/15/the-ultimates-volume-1-super-human/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/15/the-ultimates-volume-1-super-human/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let’s get the team together!

&lt;p>Captain America!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now… we just need someone to fight…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s a solid opener. Enough with the meet and greet to know who is who (even if it does rely somewhat on previous superhero knowledge) and then let them fight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m looking forward to seeing where else they go from here!&lt;/p>

Hard to understand with a heart of gold. Then a quick look at what’s the Professor actually did to Magneto. Here’s a hint: actually killing him might have been kinder in the long run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then finally, we’re on to the World Tour! It’s all about proving that mutants do good for the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What could possibly go wrong…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really do fall on the ‘Professor is being an overly pacifist idiot’ side of times things. It’ll be interesting to see what’s next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, these plots really could use some more time to breath. In the span of a single volume, we&amp;rsquo;re introduced to the idea of &lt;span class="spoiler">Professor X having a wife and child&lt;/span>
to said &lt;span class="spoiler">child trying to kill everything&lt;/span>
to &lt;span class="spoiler">their eventual defeat (for now? it's unclear)&lt;/span>

&lt;p>Good times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s another crazy action packed volume. I’m amazed at how much they’re fitting into these. Almost as amazed at how any of them are supposed to fit into those outfits…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, Weapon X, S.H.I.E.L.D., what’s left of the Brotherhood, and a few new friends all together. Learning just what lines they’ll each be willing to cross…&lt;/p>

Iron Man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole idea that they don’t know that Iron Man is a man in a suit rather than a robot and that for some reason Tony wants to keep it that way—and thinks that he can is a bit crazy to me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not to mention that the healing factor (and thus Tony’s disregard for getting hurt) still feels wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A really weird/rough way to take Iron Man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a bit of a bummer, since I enjoyed Card’s earlier writing (Ender’s game primarily) even if his later stuff got weird and preachy. But I still had hope…&lt;/p>

&lt;p>That is an awful lot to fit into a single volume…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The philosophical differences between Professor X and his X-Men versus Magneto and his Brotherhood is quite often at the core of these stories, so it’s no surprise to see it here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only question is… what comes next?!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Letters from a Shipwreck in the Sea of Suns and Moons</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/letters-from-a-shipwreck-in-the-sea-of-suns-and-moons/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 00:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/letters-from-a-shipwreck-in-the-sea-of-suns-and-moons/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We are the interviewers. For a story.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And who am I?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You are the old sailor who remembers being a young sailor on Unicorn, a three masted schooner out of San Francisco plying the Pacific waters.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That sounds familiar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You are Clarence St. Elmo, for a name. You are a bad poet lost in the sea of time, a castaway on an island where the dead gods wander.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That sounds awful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>And beyond a name, on that side of things, past the mirror and the window and the words, you are the Keeper of Shipwreck Light in the Sea of Suns and Moons.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, I knew that.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;hellip; is a truly delightfully weird book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It jumps around in structure and time between letters from a sailor to the girl he left back home&amp;ndash;to said sailor being interviewed by &amp;hellip; someone&amp;ndash;to stories about a most mysterious shipwreck and the island he came to inhabit thereafter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Structurally, it&amp;rsquo;s very strange and at times hard to figure out what in the world is going on&amp;ndash;but that&amp;rsquo;s all intentional. It&amp;rsquo;s really quite worth it in the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s not much more I can say without spoiling the whole thing&amp;ndash;that is, if I really actually understood what and how, if anything, of the story actually happened. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well worth a read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Consider Phlebas</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/consider-phlebas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 00:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/consider-phlebas/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Culture: a &amp;ldquo;a utopian, post-scarcity space society of humanoid aliens, and advanced superintelligent artificial intelligences living in artificial habitats spread across the Milky Way galaxy&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture%20series">Culture series&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Besides, it left the humans in the Culture free to take care of the things that really mattered in life, such as sports, games, romance, studying dead languages, barbarian societies and impossible problems, and climbing high mountains without the aid of a safety harness.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;d think (or at least I did) from that description that we&amp;rsquo;d have everything starting in a state of wonder and harmony&amp;hellip; and only then watch things go to hell (because otherwise, where&amp;rsquo;s the story?).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So imagine my surprise where (in Consider Phlebas), we start in the middle of a war between the Culture and another group (the Idirans) told from the point of a view of a shape shifting secret agent (more or less) who ends up with a crew of mercenaries (no, they&amp;rsquo;re a &amp;lsquo;Free Company&amp;rsquo;), goes through a few disastrous missions with them, almost gets eaten by a disgusting gigantic blob of a religious cult leader, breaks into a card game where the stakes are real human lives, and finally comes back to a graveyard system and then just about everyone dies.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Experience as well as common sense indicated that the most reliable method of avoiding self-extinction was not to equip oneself with the means to accomplish it in the first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I &amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t even know what to say.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Elektra: Devil's Due</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/ultimate-elektra-devils-due/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 00:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/ultimate-elektra-devils-due/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-elektra-70326f.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing bad ever came of a ‘who can you trust?’&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The contrast between Matt Murdock and Elektra is really what sells these stories. Doing what’s right versus what needs to be done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope to see more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if Kingpin is involved…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Daredevil &amp; Elektra</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/ultimate-daredevil-elektra/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/ultimate-daredevil-elektra/</guid><description>&lt;p>Only &lt;strike>one volume&lt;/strike> two volumes. Interesting. Let’s go!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-daredevil-and-elektra-c573e5.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Elektra making new friends at college.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-daredevil-and-elektra-f7b716.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And a younger than I’m used to Matt Murdock, already fighting crime and just starting in on the law stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course things escalate quickly and of course something has to drive them apart. One of the rules of comics it seems. No one can be happy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope we see more of them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 2: Learning Curve</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/10/ultimate-spider-man-volume-2-learning-curve/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/10/ultimate-spider-man-volume-2-learning-curve/</guid><description>&lt;p>Spider-Man starts to settle in to his new life. School, a job, a bit of light vigilantism, perhaps a date with MJ…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and of course decides to set his sights on the big man himself: Mr. Fisk. Kingpin. He’s a personal favorite big (heh) bad of mine. So I’m looking forward to where this goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also I’m enjoying the teenage dynamic. So far as I’m concerned they nailed it. It’s insane, what he’s trying to do… but it feels so right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 1: Power and Responsibility</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/09/ultimate-spider-man-volume-1-power-and-responsibility/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/09/ultimate-spider-man-volume-1-power-and-responsibility/</guid><description>&lt;p>Peter Parker gets beat up at school; Parker goes in a field trip to Osborn’s lab; spider goes chomp; etc. It’s the standard Spider-Man origin, especially if you (like me) started with the Sam Raimu Spider-Man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But you have to start somewhere right? It’s a solid story, I like the art, and we’re setting up for something big.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shaman</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/08/shaman/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/08/shaman/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There are no secrets, there is no mystery. We make that all up. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s all right there in front of us. You have to have enough food to get through winter and spring. That&amp;rsquo;s what it all comes down to. You have to live in a way that will gather enough food each fall to get through winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Take a survival story (a la Gary Paulsen&amp;rsquo;s Hatchet), re-tune it for a world where survival is life rather than a temporary situation (ten thousand or so years ago), sprinkle in an oddly modern feeling narrator, and make it super horny&amp;hellip; voila. Shaman.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I at once rather enjoyed it and was rather annoyed by good parts of it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Runaways, Vol. 11: Homeschooling</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/06/runaways-vol.-11-homeschooling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 00:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/06/runaways-vol.-11-homeschooling/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/runaways-v11-8a6ca4.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh boy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New family! Gert? (We’ve done not-Alex already)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then it just ends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Super depressing. Just stop at volume 8.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fin.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Runaways, Vol. 10: Rock Zombies</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/06/runaways-vol.-10-rock-zombies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 00:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/06/runaways-vol.-10-rock-zombies/</guid><description>&lt;p>Music laced with spells turns anyone who has plastic surgery ugly. Not even kidding. Also zombies, but apparently they’re not actually dead (killing of like half of LA is apparently too much). So … just ugly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s… fine?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn’t even take any pretty pictures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we weren’t down to one more volume and a new writer…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Runaways, Vol. 9: Dead Wrong</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/06/runaways-vol.-9-dead-wrong/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/06/runaways-vol.-9-dead-wrong/</guid><description>&lt;p>That is quite an art shift.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/runaways-v9-f542e7.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And quite a cosmic plot line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do you even deal with billions dead somewhere out there across the universe?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and I feel like Chase got stupider. In a bad way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/runaways-v9-edbd5f.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s something of a reason… but he was off even before Scatter’ing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fine, but I liked the earlier works. We’ll see how it goes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Betsy-Tacy</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/05/betsy-tacy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/05/betsy-tacy/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“When Betsy is happy,” her mother said, “she is happier than anyone else in the world.” Then she added, “And she’s almost always happy.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A cute book to read with younger children. In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s the story about Tacy (she&amp;rsquo;s shy) and Betsy (she tells everyone that Tacy is shy). They go on adventures, have a clubhouse, and eventually find another new friend&amp;ndash;just in time to start another book.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
