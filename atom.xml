&lt;p>In a perfect world, you don&amp;rsquo;t need it. You can write a CSP with a minimal &lt;code>script-src&lt;/code> policy, including only scripts from your own domains (&lt;code>self&lt;/code>) or a list of specific other scripts or at worst domains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But sometimes real life (and third party libraries) get in the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It starts with inline scripts. So you have to add &lt;code>unsafe-inline&lt;/code>. But there&amp;rsquo;s a better way to do that: CSP nonces. Specify a randomly generated (per request) nonce in the CSP header and then apply that same nonce to every &lt;code>script&lt;/code> tag. Voila. Better.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem-inline-javascript-events">The problem: inline JavaScript events&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>But what about something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672">button&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">onClick&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;doSomething();&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Well, you might say, don&amp;rsquo;t do that. Write it as a script:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672">button&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">id&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;doSomethinger&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672">script&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">nonce&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;correctHorseBatteryStable&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>document.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">getElementById&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;doSomethinger&amp;#34;&lt;/span>).&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">addEventListener&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;click&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">function&lt;/span>() {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">doSomething&lt;/span>();
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>});
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;lt;/&lt;span style="color:#f92672">script&lt;/span>&amp;gt;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>But like I said&amp;ndash;third parties scripts can be imperfect. And sometimes, they just &lt;em>insist&lt;/em> on embedding their own event handlers inline.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-solution-unsafe-hashes">A solution: &lt;code>unsafe-hashes&lt;/code>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Enter: &lt;code>unsafe-hashes&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, you can add this to your CSP:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>script-src &amp;#39;unsafe-hashes&amp;#39; &amp;#39;sha256-44558f2c36efd8163eac2903cec13ed1fafcca51abd91d9f696321ab895f1107&amp;#39;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This tells the browser that you &lt;em>are&lt;/em> allowed to have event listeners directly on HTML elements&amp;hellip; so long as the content of the JavaScript hashes &lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> to any hash listed as an &lt;code>unsafe-hash&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$ echo -n &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;doSomething();&amp;#34;&lt;/span> | sha256
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>44558f2c36efd8163eac2903cec13ed1fafcca51abd91d9f696321ab895f1107
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="it-gets-worse-dynamically-generated-javascript">It gets worse: dynamically generated JavaScript&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is, however, one problem with this that does come up unfortunately often. If you&amp;rsquo;re already dealing with third parties not doing things you wish they would, well then you have to deal with fun code like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-php" data-lang="php">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;?&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">php&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">foreach&lt;/span> ($buttonIds &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">as&lt;/span> $buttonId) {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">echo&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;&amp;lt;button onclick=&amp;#34;doSomething(&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span> $buttonId &lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;);&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Button &amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span> $buttonId &lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">PHP_EOL&lt;/span>;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">?&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Unfortunately&amp;hellip; that completely blows up the CSP. Because&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$ echo -n &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;doSomething(1);&amp;#34;&lt;/span> | sha256
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>2ef899c15aae95711855a45a5bb93c55363162e0e75e295aad4f189f20323d7c
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$ echo -n &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;doSomething(5);&amp;#34;&lt;/span> | sha256
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>0e03bb385169b89c95eb62659f50604ffb8283154bd58ab8cc7e692c4b5c05a3
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$ echo -n &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;doSomething(42);&amp;#34;&lt;/span> | sha256
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>4d9691449db6740ee19207c5bb52361eb97e18f06352ed400f83ae7caee270da
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Just hashes doing hash things there. So basically, you have to be able to dynamically generate your CSP on the fly, including all of the hashes of all of the functions &lt;em>and with each of their arguments&lt;/em> that are either possible or (even better) actually used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And this isn&amp;rsquo;t fun at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, you might say: but you can do something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-php" data-lang="php">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;?&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">php&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">foreach&lt;/span> ($buttonIds &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">as&lt;/span> $buttonId) {
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">echo&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;&amp;lt;button data-id=&amp;#34;$buttonId&amp;#34; onclick=&amp;#34;doSomething(this.dataset.id);&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">?&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>After all&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>$ echo -n &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;doSomething(this.dataset.id);&amp;#34;&lt;/span> | sha256
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>d2ecabb98b1bb7cc81cd75d43dcb7bac08ce31055339920976cb92aa2f5dd2f5
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Only one hash!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But if you have that much control&amp;hellip; then why are you using inline JavaScript in the first place?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="is-it-safe">Is it safe?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Is this safe?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;code>unsafe-*&lt;/code> for a reason. An attacker that controls input can theoretically take any of the hashed functions you&amp;rsquo;re including (like &lt;code>submitPayment&lt;/code>&amp;hellip;) and inject them in places they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. And heck, if you manage to find a SHA-256 hash collision? Well, then you have far more interesting things to do with &lt;em>that&lt;/em> then attacking some site that found themselves force to used &lt;code>unsafe-hashes&lt;/code>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>But&lt;/em> it&amp;rsquo;s better than &lt;code>unsafe-inline&lt;/code> without &lt;code>nonces&lt;/code> which allows arbitrary inline scripts. And unfortunately, there&amp;rsquo;s no way to actually use &lt;code>nonces&lt;/code> with inline scripts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And while a perfectly secure system would be the best case, it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely better to do as much as you can to secure a system rather than doing nothing waiting for the perfect solution to become possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a virtual CPU from NAND gates up</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/21/building-a-virtual-cpu-from-nand-gates-up/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/21/building-a-virtual-cpu-from-nand-gates-up/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past couple of weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent entirely longer than I probably should have falling down the rabbit hole that is the game &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing Complete&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, you start with basically nothing, build up simple logic gates, create memory cells and 1-bit addition, build that into 8-bit math and logic, read instructions RAM, implement loops, and function calls (in hardware!), and eventually use your very own custom built CPU to solve a few programming challenges.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Million Dollar Baby</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/17/million-dollar-baby/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/17/million-dollar-baby/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another novella from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/22/into-the-woods-tales-from-the-hollows-and-beyond/">Into the Woods&lt;/a>: The story of what Jenks and Trent were up to during &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/13/pale-demon/">Pale Demon&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>ELF QUEST!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s really quite spoilery (for Pale Demon) to really get into what that &lt;em>actually&lt;/em> means, but the short version is that we get another major magical heist novel, which is all sorts of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Trent and Jenks are a surprisingly fun combo. It&amp;rsquo;s nice every once in a while to have parts about Rachel without having her on screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“No, not really.” One hand holding his wings tight to his body, Jenks turned to look behind him at their forward progress. “Rachel makes enough mistakes in one week to fill a twenty-yard dump truck.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Exactly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and more elf politics:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>He trusted people. He trusted quite a few, and quite a few had “screwed him over” as Jenks put it. The difference was that when people betrayed him, sometimes other people died. And then other people thought it was his fault. He was tired of it. Everything he had was at risk for the next four hours. Quen said he was not his father, but he was doing the same damning things. &amp;hellip; The Goddess help him, they had to come out of the closet if only so he could stop killing people.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A fun short story! And with even &lt;em>more&lt;/em> implications to the broader Hollows universe than Pale Demon. It&amp;rsquo;ll be interesting to see how that all shakes out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hacks: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/15/hacks-season-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/15/hacks-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well. That is most definitely a show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ava is an entitled 25 year old with basically no filter. Deborah Vance is Las Vegas comedian that might just be at the end of her career (certainly not by choice).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now they have to work together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some hilarious moments in this show. And I do really love Jean Smart as Deborah Vance. Hannah Einbinder as Ava Daniels is &lt;em>so&lt;/em> cringe at times (no filter!), but &lt;em>that&amp;rsquo;s the point&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the dynamic between the two is &lt;em>fascinating&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carl Clemons-Hopkins as Marcus provides quite the B plot as very gay and very much running things for Deborah.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally Paul W. Downs as Jimmy and Megan Stalter as Kayla&amp;hellip; I could do with less of that. I guess you have to have someone keeping things moving?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s, I think, a show surprisingly worth watching. Onward to season 2!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pale Demon</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/13/pale-demon/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/07/13/pale-demon/</guid><description>&lt;p>So Rachel is sanctioned. She has one chance to travel (on purpose this time) to San Francisco to try to clear her name. Except&amp;hellip; she can&amp;rsquo;t fly, because politics&amp;ndash;road trip! And has to take Trent, also because politics&amp;ndash;road trip with Jenks, Ivy, Rachel, and Trent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Jenks: Relax cookie maker. They’ve been there since Terre Haute.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>lol. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keebler%20elves">Keebler elves&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terre%20Haute">Terre Haute&lt;/a>. I went to school there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then they blew up a national monument.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And freed a demon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And saved another demon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And learned what is actually &lt;em>different&lt;/em> about the female demons.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But Al was shaking his head, looking ill. “I am not going to be the person who completes you,” he said, glancing at me and turning away. “You are one messed-up bitch.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And suddenly&amp;hellip; &lt;em>baby&lt;/em>! (I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you to guess if it&amp;rsquo;s who you expect or not).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man that&amp;rsquo;s a lot for a single book. And with what looks like might be permanent reprecussions across the Hollows universe (and Rachel especially) that we&amp;rsquo;re only barely beginning to feel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: This was a fun line:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“So all those buttons are different restaurants?” I asked, looking at the jukebox, now totally out of place, like a British police call box on the deck of the Titanic.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I understood that reference. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second side note: So&amp;hellip; how many cross breeds are possible in this universe? We have some hints because of how species diverged from one another. And we also have elves with some human lineage. But what else is possible? And what if we include all sorts of genetic tampering that is seemingly possible in this world&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MoCA Upgrades and Coax woes</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/30/moca-upgrades-and-coax-woes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/30/moca-upgrades-and-coax-woes/</guid><description>&lt;p>So over the past week or so&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve been having some serious issues with the internet at home.

&lt;p>So I decided to finally bite the bullet and do an upgrade that I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do for a long time: Install &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoCA%20Adaptors">MoCA Adaptors&lt;/a> to use the existing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coaxial%20cables">coaxial cables&lt;/a> already in the walls to provide a wired connection between the mesh routers I&amp;rsquo;m already using on the various floors of the house.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>President Thaddeus Ross: When a Celestial mass emerged in the Indian Ocean, we did what we often do. We squabbled over it. Countries rushed in to claim it as their own, setting up research facilities to exploit its resources. What was found inside that island is nothing short of the discovery of the millennium. Its potential applications in tech, in medicine, in defense are immeasurable. It&amp;rsquo;s even more indestructible than vibranium. And it&amp;rsquo;s not controlled by an isolationist nation. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you adamantium.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So. We&amp;rsquo;re going to not only finally deal with that mess from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/25/eternals/">Eternals&lt;/a>, but we&amp;rsquo;re also going to finally get in universe adamantium? Interesting strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, we have a new Captain America. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure Anthony Mackie could head a movie in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/04/24/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier/">The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/a> (or S2 of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/altered-carbon/">Altered Carbon&lt;/a> for that matter), but I actually quite enjoyed him this time around. I think Danny Ramirez / Joaquin Torres / the new Falcon really helped with that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise, we have Harrison Ford taking over for William Hurt as Ross. I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;hellip; still surprised when I see Harrison Ford still being quite as active an actor as he is. It was already slightly odd in Kindom of the Crystal Skull&amp;hellip; and that was more than 15 years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a step up from the recent spate of Marvel movies/TV. Hnoestly, it&amp;rsquo;s been probably since &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/03/18/spider-man-no-way-home/">Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/29/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness/">Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/a>&amp;hellip; Still, a decent action flick?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Black Magic Sanction</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/19/black-magic-sanction/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/19/black-magic-sanction/</guid><description>&lt;p>So. Alcatraz is back in service. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of brilliant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, Rachel is dealing with her shunning&amp;ndash;and far far worse. The witches of the world aren&amp;rsquo;t on her side any more, but perhaps she can get some help from&amp;hellip; Trent? Al? Nick?! (Why is Nick back around&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the only way out is&amp;hellip; suddenly, we have a heist novel now. It seems like this is &lt;em>really&lt;/em> not the time. And double that, when Rachel randomly decides to use that Pandora charm that&amp;rsquo;s been floating around. &lt;em>now?!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man she has issues with long term thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;How did you know we were in trouble?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re always in trouble, Rachel,&amp;rdquo; he said, fixing his hat firmly back on his head.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And seems &lt;em>so very&lt;/em> deadset on not killing anything ever. Which, I suppose if you&amp;rsquo;re going to do black magic, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to give anyone any other reasons to hate you. But sometimes, especially in a world like this, there are people you just can&amp;rsquo;t hang on to. Oy. (Not to mention that she seems fine with those around her killing&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially after 8 books. And after what happened to Jenks&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, another good story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Random world building notes:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>His eyes were alight. I&amp;rsquo;d seen that look on college students debating such ridiculous stuff as how the world would be today if Napoleon hadn&amp;rsquo;t stirred that misaligned spell and won Waterloo, or if the Turn had never happened and we&amp;rsquo;d gone to the moon instead. &amp;ldquo;Okay, I got that,&amp;rdquo; I said, and Pierce pushed from the table to take his plate to the sink.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I do love the subtle(ish) nods to our world / what might have been. Good times those.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ley Line Drifter</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/15/ley-line-drifter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/15/ley-line-drifter/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another novella from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/22/into-the-woods-tales-from-the-hollows-and-beyond/">Into the Woods&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, this time with Jenks striking out on his own (more or less) to save the day!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First thought: Jenks and Bis is a fun dynamic. Jenks is a lot when he&amp;rsquo;s a side character, but somehow seeing into his head is so much better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In that reguard, have we actually seen on screen/page what Jenks wished for all the way back in the first book? Daw.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And has Rachel figured out what I think Jenks already knows here about what the embeggining actually did to him?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second thought:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Jenks?” Bis said loudly, half hiding behind Sylvan’s statue. “Maybe we should leave the goddess alone.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Huh. So thinking about it, have we really seen much in the way of &amp;rsquo;tiers&amp;rsquo; of creatures in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-hollows/">The Hollows&lt;/a>? There are some that are difficult for others to fight, but nothing truly &amp;lsquo;godly&amp;rsquo;. Interesting that.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And what about Daryl, anyway? A deluded nymph, Sylvan had said. A goddess, Daryl claimed. There were no gods or goddesses. Never had been, but there were documented histories of Inderlanders taking advantage of humans, posing as deities. He frowned. Her eyes were downright creepy, and he hadn’t liked demons being mentioned, either.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I wonder if that will stick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise&amp;hellip; we learn in this book that apparently Pixies can &lt;span class="spoiler">make explosives&lt;/span>
. Delightful. And no one knows. Probably for the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally, some last bits of world building around pixies and gargoyles. They eat pigeons (the latter) and their names get longer the further down the birth order they are (the former).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a fun little story. Always neat to see the side characters get their chance to shine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do bet that, just like banshees, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the last we&amp;rsquo;ll see of nymphs/dryads in this series. Or at least I hope it isn&amp;rsquo;t!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Misty of Chicoteague</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/13/misty-of-chicoteague/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/13/misty-of-chicoteague/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, that&amp;rsquo;s a cute little story for what it is. And my daughter really enjoyed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, oldentimes life on an island. Yearly, all the people on the island go across to another one, round up wild horses, and drive them across the island to train and sell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course our young protagonists find the horse of their dreams and go through everything to find and bring her back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s cute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note, it&amp;rsquo;s fun finding out that Misty was a real horse! Although, perhaps don&amp;rsquo;t read too far into all that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_of_Chincoteague_%28novel%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspiration&lt;/a>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>White Witch, Black Curse</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/11/white-witch-black-curse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/11/white-witch-black-curse/</guid><description>&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; banshee?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Heh. Called it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So basically, we have Rachel dealing with the events/fallout of &lt;em>Dirty Magic&lt;/em> (from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/22/into-the-woods-tales-from-the-hollows-and-beyond/">Into the Woods&lt;/a>): wherein we find out what banshees are in the world of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-hollows/">The Hollows&lt;/a> and see Ivy dealing with one&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, I think this might be the first main book in which we see Robbie (also in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/22/two-ghosts-for-sister-rachel/">Two Ghosts for Sister Rachel&lt;/a>)&amp;hellip; and he&amp;rsquo;s not the only one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So anyways, we have Rachel still dealing with the fallout of Kistin&amp;rsquo;s death, a new uber-predator on the loose (banshees are basically vampires on steroids it seems), a blast from the past (both in general and Rachel&amp;rsquo;s specifically), Al, witch sex, auras, and SHUNNING (all caps).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Sweet mother of Tink,” Jenks whispered from the ladle. “What just happened?&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Quite a book.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Jenks flew two circles around me to stretch his wings, then landed on Ivy’s shoulder. She was staring at the city, mesmerized. “It looks peaceful from up here,” she said when her line of sight was broken by a member of the waitstaff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jenks snorted. “It looks peaceful when you get up real close, too,” he said, and I thought of my garden. “It’s only the middle ground that’s ugly.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But hey, (minor spoilers), we do get at least some forward progress on Kistin&amp;rsquo;s murderer!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, another solid entry. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Timing Reddit and Enabling Grayness (iOS Shortcuts)</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/04/timing-reddit-and-enabling-grayness-ios-shortcuts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/04/timing-reddit-and-enabling-grayness-ios-shortcuts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I got back and forth with messing with iOS Shortcuts for automation.

&lt;p>But that&amp;rsquo;s just the Apple way it seem :\ So it goes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Outlaw Demon Wails</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/03/the-outlaw-demon-wails/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/06/03/the-outlaw-demon-wails/</guid><description>&lt;p>Okay, enough side stories (and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/19/the-turn-the-hollows-begins-with-death/">prequels&lt;/a>!). Back to the main story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, Rachel can do demon things. And in doing so, she&amp;rsquo;s managed to really piss off one demon: Algaliarept (Al). Now he&amp;rsquo;s out every night on a technicality and coming for Rachel.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“You can’t forget anything,” I said, watching the words vanish into nothing. “And even if you do, it always comes back to bitch-slap you in the morning.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So how in the world is she going to solve this one? Well&amp;hellip; perhaps not in &lt;em>the world&lt;/em> after all.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Rache?” Jenks said warily, hovering as I hid my hands so he couldn’t see them shake. “What did you do?”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, more elf shenanigans with Trent and Ceri (although not the two of them together :whew:).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Relationship drama, both with Ivy and perhaps with Marshal (from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/19/a-fistful-of-charms/">A Fistful of Charms&lt;/a>). It&amp;rsquo;s not quite Kistin, but it will be interesting to see. And uniting auras. What&amp;rsquo;s up with that? A mystery for another book I suppose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and historical drama with Rachel&amp;rsquo;s mom (now that was a bombshell&amp;hellip;). I figured something was up with that, but man that was still a hit. It will be interesting to see where that goes&amp;ndash;and if her mom will become a larger player going forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and suddenly Ryn Cormel. Who I just met in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/19/the-turn-the-hollows-begins-with-death/">The Turn&lt;/a>. Interesting that. If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t read the prequel, would I have missed out on anything? Probably not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and a Gargoyle. I expected more from that. But perhaps next book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I &lt;em>really&lt;/em> enjoyed this one. This series has turned out to be primarily about demons, but&amp;hellip; perhaps that makes sense given, well, everything. I&amp;rsquo;m here for it though!&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Side note: I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to these on audiobok. Why&amp;hellip; does this one have a different narrator? It&amp;rsquo;s a bit jarring. Piss-ker-ee. Lee line. Jenks&amp;rsquo; new voice. I think it&amp;rsquo;d be perfectly fine (although lee line would probably still bother me), but I&amp;rsquo;d just gotten so used to the other!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/21045927-a-change-in-narrator-for-this-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is a discussion about this&lt;/a> on Goodreads.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ms. Gavin and I are both working to get her to read AMERICAN DEMON. Should happen!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ndash; Kim Harrison&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Not a why, but at least it&amp;rsquo;s known? And apparently we&amp;rsquo;ll go back to Marguerite Gavin after this one!&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Second side note: The fact that they said &amp;lsquo;Al went into human resources&amp;rsquo; is certainly a choice. And they just skate &lt;em>right on&lt;/em> by that one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Marvels</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/31/the-marvels/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/31/the-marvels/</guid><description>&lt;p>You know, for the first half of the movie, that was actually a lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Then why did you touch it?&lt;br>
Because it was glowing and mysterious.&lt;br>
Okay new rule - No touching shit&lt;br>
I’m getting a lot of negative energy from you and I don’t need that right now.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Chaos ensues and bad decisions mean that the Marvels (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/23/ms.-marvel/">Ms. Marvel&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/28/captain-marvel/">Captain Marvel&lt;/a>, and&amp;hellip; the other one? (Monica Rambeau, most recently from &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/03/19/wandavision/">WandaVision&lt;/a>)) are now suddenly swapping places across time and space. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>really&lt;/em> make any sense, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun to watch!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then&amp;hellip; the whole thing starts going off the rails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why don&amp;rsquo;t they have help? Why does Ms. Marvel even wear that bangle?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And&amp;hellip; seriously? A planet where they &lt;em>sing&lt;/em> instead of speak and can&amp;rsquo;t understand if you don&amp;rsquo;t sing? That&amp;rsquo;s a comics silly reason; it just feels weird on the big screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And what in the &lt;em>world&lt;/em> is with those Flerken scenes&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s already the shortest movie in the MCU. Did they just really not have enough content so they had to pad it with &lt;em>something&lt;/em>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it was almost there, but like much of the MCU for&amp;hellip; a while now. It could have been so much better.&lt;/p>

Young Rachel (finishing school, desperately wanting to go to the IS), still living at home with her mother, when her brother comes to visit! Given that we&amp;rsquo;ve barely seen them on page (&lt;em>have&lt;/em> we see her brother?), it&amp;rsquo;s some fun bit of backstory&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then the entire story revolves around trying to contact Rachel&amp;rsquo;s dead father to win a bet (and to join the IS in his footsteps), well, of course things are going to get complicated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun story with just the right amount of gut punches and backstory. I do wonder what we&amp;rsquo;ll see &amp;lsquo;in between&amp;rsquo;. How does Rachel end up strong enough to go on runs? She certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t doing that well here. And will see see her time at that camp?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, worth the read!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: red eye flights being renamed to &amp;lsquo;vamp flights&amp;rsquo; is a fun detail.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Life was more than waiting for it to end so she could started living.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Man Ivy is a mess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this is the/a story of how Ivy came to be, how screwy (heh) vampires can be, how she got to be working as a runner, and how she came to meet Rachel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a pretty fun way to set it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and much like &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/22/into-the-woods-tales-from-the-hollows-and-beyond/#the-bridges-of-eden-park">The Bridges of Eden Park&lt;/a> this (especially the Kisten parts) back to back with &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/11/for-a-few-demons-more/">For a Few Demons More&lt;/a> is certainly a touch of whiplash.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Turn: The Hollows Begins with Death</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/19/the-turn-the-hollows-begins-with-death/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/19/the-turn-the-hollows-begins-with-death/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The only thing worse than starting a plague on purpose was being stupid enough to start it by accident.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ve read (and quite enjoyed) enough of the Hollows that I want to go back and pick up the short stories and other supplementary stories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter: The Turn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The story of science, betrayal, tomatoes, and a whole bunch of deaths that changed the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun story. While I really do appreciate that the Hollows is a world with without a &amp;lsquo;masquerade&amp;rsquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see the world before (and &lt;em>as&lt;/em>) all of the various Interlanders came out into the open. Especially seeing who was involved&amp;ndash;and wondering just what they&amp;rsquo;re all up to in the more modern time I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“A person is okay,” he said, peering into the darkness and the open street. “But when you put a bunch of us together, something is switched on, something ugly.” He glanced at her apologetically. “All of us, humans and nonhumans alike, are genetically primed to attack what’s different from the collective.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Overall, a fun story to set up. As far as I&amp;rsquo;ve read, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to read for the main series, but I&amp;rsquo;ms till glad to have read it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bastille vs. the Evil Librarians</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/11/bastille-vs.-the-evil-librarians/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/11/bastille-vs.-the-evil-librarians/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so it ends. Again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the events of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/23/the-dark-talent/">The Dark Talent&lt;/a>, Alcatraz isn&amp;rsquo;t doing so well&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, the Talents are still gone, several Smedrys are dead&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and the world is about to end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So of course we have one last adventure. Chock full of impossible situations, anti-gravity sharks, a Gak, &lt;em>so&lt;/em> many straw puns&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and an army of kittens&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, romance&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and a big battle on top of a giant glass spire in the middle of the ocean!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing that was kind of odd to me (having read &lt;em>almost&lt;/em> all of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/brandon-sanderson/">Brandon Sanderson&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s works at this point) is how the fine details of the magic system never quite came together&amp;ndash;and now they probably never will. The talents are a lot of fun, magic glass is neat&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;sup id="fnref:8">&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and somehow they are related&amp;hellip; but how does it all work? Is Alcatraz right? Where did it come from?! I know it&amp;rsquo;s not a &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-cosmere/">Cosmere&lt;/a> novel, so it gets a bit of a bye for that, but I wanted more. So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, compared to &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/23/the-dark-talent/">The Dark Talent&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s actually an ending, which I greatly appreciate. Other than that, I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s a weaker entry into the series. Still a lot of fun to read and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have finally gotten to them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;sup id="fnref:9">&lt;a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>For a Few Demons More</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/11/for-a-few-demons-more/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/11/for-a-few-demons-more/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There were no more choices, no more options, no more clever ways out of a tough situation. And the rush, I realized in a brutal wash of despair, is a false god I’ve chased my entire life. One that cost me everything in the blind search for sensation. My entire existence amounted to nothing.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That title is not a lie&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not just Algaliarept (Al &amp;#x1f604;) this time around. We also are introduced to Newt&amp;ndash;just sort of pops in and shows off some serious magical chops&amp;hellip; and then reveals that she&amp;rsquo;s not entirely sane any more. Mildly terrifying that. Plus Minias, her minder, who actually seems decent&amp;ndash;for a demon. Rachel is getting in pretty hard with all of these different favors owed (both ways). Makes for quite the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that Trent&amp;rsquo;s getting married. And Rachel&amp;rsquo;s not only invited&amp;hellip; but in the wedding party? Well, actually it&amp;rsquo;s to provide security (hint: demons). But of course any time you put Trent and Rachel together there&amp;rsquo;s going to be trouble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if &lt;em>that&lt;/em> wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough&amp;hellip; we have even more vampire trouble. Rachel and Ivy are such a mess&amp;ndash;and that one really can&amp;rsquo;t last too many more books. One step forward&amp;ndash;and another two back. And Kisten. Oh Kisten. Still not a good person, but perhaps good for Rachel? &lt;span class="spoiler">Oh Harrison, *that* was a low blow.&lt;/span>
&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I’ve got your back. Nothing alive will ever hurt you if I have breath in me. And nothing dead will hurt you if I don’t.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Man that&amp;rsquo;s a story. Probably the most intense so far. I fully expect (and hope) that this really shakes up the world of the Hollows and I&amp;rsquo;m curious where in the &lt;em>world&lt;/em> we can go from here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sorcery and Small Magics</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/06/sorcery-and-small-magics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/05/06/sorcery-and-small-magics/</guid><description>&lt;p>A world in which magic is split between those who can write spells and those who can cast them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A forbidden spell gone horribly wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And a quest to try to undo it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s actually a really fun story. I enjoyed the magic school aspects of it and it had a nice whimsical &lt;em>magical&lt;/em> feeling to the magic that you don&amp;rsquo;t always see, even in fantasy novels. Once we get out of the school, we see more of the hidden, dangerous parts of the world, driving more to the fantastical&amp;ndash;and deadly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On another tack, this book is tagged romance and LBGT. If anything, it&amp;rsquo;s more of magical adventure story with the first hints of what could turn out to be romance&amp;ndash;but not in this book. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting thread woven through the story&amp;ndash;especially in how it&amp;rsquo;s interacting with aforementioned forbidden spell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, the interplay between our main characters&amp;ndash;Leo (writer, POV) and Grimm (caster) is fascinating. Leo&amp;rsquo;s family is rich, Grimm&amp;rsquo;s is not. Leo is born talented and refuses to apply himself; Grimm has worked &lt;em>hard&lt;/em> to get where he is and it shows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That dynamic drives the entire story and it, as much as anything, is why I&amp;rsquo;d love to see where the story goes in the (hopefully coming soon?) sequel. It&amp;rsquo;s a well enough wrapped up story, but oh, it&amp;rsquo;s one of those where I want to see what happens next!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well worth a read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Once and Future Witches</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/29/the-once-and-future-witches/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/29/the-once-and-future-witches/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>One witch you can laugh at. Three you can burn. But what do you do with a hundred?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The Eastwood sisters grew up hard, with a mother dead in childbirth and an abusive father. The older lost as they could and the younger left in a somewhat more&amp;hellip; &lt;em>abrupt&lt;/em> manner. And then, somehow, they all ended up at the same suffrage rally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>James Juniper. Maiden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Agnes Amaranth. Mother.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beatrice Belladonna. Crone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating tale, digging into women&amp;rsquo;s right (suffrage and otherwise), race, homophobia, and sexuality told in an alternate history end of the 1800s, all wrapped a world where witches are &lt;em>real&lt;/em>. Where magic lies waiting. And where women&amp;rsquo;s tales have &lt;em>power&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>All of us grew up on stories of wicked witches. The villages they cursed, the plagues they brewed. We need to show people what else we have to offer, give them better stories.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m by no means an expert on the time period, so I&amp;rsquo;ve no idea how much of the characters and events of the stories have a basis in our world, but it has the feel of a world that could very well have been real&amp;ndash;something in the world just down the road.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Or perhaps for all of them: for the little girls thrown in cellars and the grown women sent to workhouses, the mothers who shouldn’t have died and the witches who shouldn’t have burned. For all the women punished merely for wanting what they shouldn’t.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I quite enjoyed this book!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Night at the Museum</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/26/night-at-the-museum/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/26/night-at-the-museum/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another on that list of movies I&amp;rsquo;m a little surprised I&amp;rsquo;d never seen before&amp;ndash;yet I&amp;rsquo;ve seen enough random clips on YouTube shorts at this point that I feel like I have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Side note: This also came back to mind since Ben Stiller wrote a good amount of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/severance/">Severance&lt;/a> of all things.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s a ridiculous and fun movie. The whole premise&amp;ndash;that a magical artifact somehow animates all the exhibits at the museum every night&amp;ndash;yet somehow no one has ever noticed this? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the list bit of sense. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it any less fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Easter Island Head: HEY!&lt;br>
[pauses]&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: Dum-dum.&lt;br>
Larry: Yes?&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: You give me gum-gum!&lt;br>
Larry: I give you gum-gum?&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: You new Dum-dum. You give me gum-gum.&lt;br>
Larry: Gee, okay, you know what? I have no gum-gum. Sorry. And my name isn&amp;rsquo;t Dum-dum. My name&amp;rsquo;s Larry.&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: No, your name Dum-dum.&lt;br>
[some people are running away]&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: Oh, you in trouble, Dum-dum. You better run-run. From Attila the Hun-hun.&lt;br>
[Attila yells and chases Larry]&lt;br>
Easter Island Head: See you later, Dum-dum!&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There are a lot of fun action scenes in the movie. Just don&amp;rsquo;t think about it all too hard and enjoy the ride. I especially loved the chaos of the dioramas of thousands of tiny men come to life and fighting one another. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Jedediah: No problemo, Gigantor.&lt;br>
Larry: Um, my name&amp;rsquo;s Larry, first of all okay, Jed? See, I call you Jed, I don&amp;rsquo;t call you tiny, right?&lt;br>
Jedediah: What&amp;rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&lt;br>
Larry: Hey teeny, how does that sound?&lt;br>
Jedediah: I&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t like it. It hurts my feelings.&lt;br>
Larry: Okay, well Gigantor makes me feel like some sort of freak.&lt;br>
Octavius: I don&amp;rsquo;t. I just call you Larry.&lt;br>
Larry: Don&amp;rsquo;t be a kiss-ass.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The casting in this movie is a big strength! Dick Van Dyke was a lot of fun as old former night watchman Cecil. Robin Williams (RIP :sad:) is always a delight and his Teddy Roosevelt was no exception. Rami Malek is certainly no &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/mr.-robot/">Mr. Robot&lt;/a>, but he&amp;rsquo;s got a perfect presence as Ahkmenrah. And Steve Coogan as Octavius and Owen Wilson&amp;rsquo;s Jedediah were hilarious (especially since the latter was originally a minor cameo).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And you know? Apparently &amp;lsquo;The real-life American Museum of Natural History had 20% more visitors during the holiday season following this movie&amp;rsquo;s opening.&amp;rsquo; So good on them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now the sequels? No idea where they go from here, but you know what? Worth a try!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/25/indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/25/indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull/</guid><description>&lt;p>Man &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/19/indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade/">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&lt;/a> was such a good movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then they made another one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s not as bad as I remembered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Harrison Jones isn&amp;rsquo;t getting younger&amp;hellip; but he still really makes Indiana Jones. Full stop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I bet they were expecting this film (and especially Shia LeBeouf&amp;rsquo;s Mutt) to go better and possibly pass the torch. It was an echo of the same dynamic as Indy and his father in The Last Crusade. Just not quite done as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was kind of fun to see the Soviets be the bad guys this time around and it more or less fits this new, older Indy.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Dean Charles Stanforth: I barely recognize this country anymore. The government&amp;rsquo;s got us seeing Communists in our soup. When the hysteria reaches academia, I guess it&amp;rsquo;s time to call it a career.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>On top of that, seeing Karen Allen&amp;rsquo;s Marion Ravenwood again after all these years? And with the obvious fallout of that? That was more fun than I expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And man. Cate Blanchett act the heck out of that role. But still, she just wasn&amp;rsquo;t as much a villain as previous films.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course&amp;ndash;the action scenes. A bit more over the top than previous movies? Do you even &lt;em>remember&lt;/em> the roller coaster mine cart of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/indiana-jones-and-the-temple-of-doom/">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&lt;/a>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed the opening in the warehouse. The nuclear bomb-fridge scene has been talked about to death. The motorcycle chase (through the library!) was a lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Indiana Jones: You want to be a good archaeologist&amp;hellip;&lt;br>
[Mutt drives them out of the building on his motorcycle]&lt;br>
Indiana Jones: &amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;ve got to get out of the library!&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The jungle fight between the jeeps was pretty cool&amp;ndash;but the Tarzan bits? a bit much&amp;hellip; The temple was technically neat, even if it didn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense. And the &lt;span class="spoiler">alien&lt;/span>
 finale wasn&amp;rsquo;t really that much weirder than centuries old knights and Nazi face melting artifacts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I think I&amp;rsquo;d place it above Temple of Doom, but below Raiders and the Last Crusade. A fun action flick and&amp;ndash;not as bad as I initially thought.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Severance: Season 1</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/25/severance-season-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/25/severance-season-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, that&amp;rsquo;s quite a show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first glance, the idea is appealing. You split your memories so that you can go to work, get paid, and essentially spend your entire life &lt;em>not at work&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But then you start to think about this other you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They never leave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They never sleep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They never have a life outside of work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;ndash;is terrifying enough even before you start getting into the whole cult&amp;rsquo;y aspects. And the hallways. And the goats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have no idea where they&amp;rsquo;re going&amp;ndash;(I hope they know)&amp;ndash;but I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>As the joke goes, you don’t have to be faster than the wolf chasing you, just faster than everyone else running away.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Turns out that trying to get letter-of-the-law against multiple packs of werewolves has consequences. For everyone involved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nick&amp;hellip; is a real piece of work. I will grant him the one small saving grace that he (along with most of the world) thought Rachel dead as part of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/14/every-which-way-but-dead/">Every Which Way But Dead&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&amp;hellip; but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make him any better a person. At least Rachel eventually realizes it? Sort of. Mostly. Ish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rachel and Ivy&amp;hellip; come to a serious head in this book. Which went about as badly as I expected. I do wish the best for Ivy, but she certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t make that easy at times and Rachel is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> helping matters here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It (among a number of other plotlines in these books) are yet a bit more of Rachel being so sure she&amp;rsquo;s right and never quite taking responsibility for when that goes sidewise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jenks? I am &lt;em>so&lt;/em> glad to see him back again. The whole running off because of not being trusted last book, I get that. But Jenks is just so fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Plan B?&amp;rdquo; Ivy said. &amp;ldquo;What is plan B?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
Jenks reddened. &amp;ldquo;Grab the fish and run like hell,&amp;rdquo; he muttered, and I almost giggled.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And now there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em>whole lot more&lt;/em> Jenks. Which &amp;hellip; kind of weird and I don&amp;rsquo;t really get it. I do wonder if that&amp;rsquo;s going to be a recurring theme or was a one off. Half-related, the entire premise that Pixies only live ~20 years and Jenks is just about there? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to deal with this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a fun read and I appreciated a new set of problems. Onward!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: Trent&amp;rsquo;s near complete absense was a bit strange. On one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s not his flavor of nonsense going on this time around, so it makes sense. But on the other hand, we have crime and rare artifacts, I fully expected that to bring him in.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/19/indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/19/indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s my favorite of teh trilogy by a solid margin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s great! All the way from the introduction with a young Indy. The introduction of the whip. The hat. His love of snakes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From there, we get a big world trotting mystery with some great action scenes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

Go between them, are you crazy?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>He choose&amp;hellip; poorly.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh it&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful movie.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>And oh, that climax. This is most certainly going to come back and bite Rachel. But honestly, what other choice did she even have?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ndash; me, re: &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/08/the-good-the-bad-and-the-undead/">The Good, the Bad, and the Undead&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Yup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All that vampire/demon business of the previous book? Causing all sorts of chaos this time around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rachel, remaining entirely &lt;em>absolutely sure she is right about everything to the detriment of everyone around her&lt;/em>? Also chaos-causing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nick-trauma and Rachel not realizing that &amp;rsquo;thing never done before&amp;rsquo; was causing some serious issues? Chaos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nick is out of town, so totally platonic date with Kristen&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Who apparently has murdered people, because&amp;hellip; duh? Vampire?&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, but he promised not to do it anymore. Chaos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do appreciate seeing Demon Al as an actual &lt;em>demon&lt;/em>. Holding a prisoner for a thousand years. I&amp;rsquo;m just waiting for an attempted redemption arc there, but as it is it &lt;em>feels good&lt;/em> when Rachel gets one over on him. And Ceri has some interesting potential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh these books. Onwards!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Good, the Bad, and the Undead</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/08/the-good-the-bad-and-the-undead/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/08/the-good-the-bad-and-the-undead/</guid><description>&lt;p>And away we go!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/02/dead-witch-walking/">Dead Witch Walking&lt;/a> set up the world, it&amp;rsquo;s here where we really start setting up Rachel Morgan and go as investigators in their own right. And of course, they&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled right into a serial killer targeting leyline witches. Good times that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is quite the cast of characters this time around. Trent Kamalack is back and as morally &amp;rsquo;totally morally gray, but maybe for good reasons&amp;rsquo; kind of person&amp;ndash;and we do get to learn the what/why he is, which is neat.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Come work for me, and I’ll tell you.”&lt;br>
My eyes went to his. “You are a thief, a cheat, a murderer, and a not-nice man,” I said calmly. “I don’t like you.”&lt;br>
He shrugged, the motion making him look utterly harmless. “I’m not a thief,” he said. “And I don’t mind manipulating you into working for me when I need it.” He smiled, showing me perfect teeth. “I enjoy it, actually.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Head local vamp Piscary is scary and understated. Rachel&amp;rsquo;s mother is wacky. Her father&amp;hellip; had secrets. And Nick&amp;hellip; well, I&amp;rsquo;m happy if Rachel is happy, but that is so not going to go well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worldbuildingwise, getting more into what exactly layline magic is, how demons work in this world (parallel reality that&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em>really&lt;/em> Hell go!), how these vampires are different, and more &amp;lsquo;humans are terrified of tomatoes&amp;rsquo; than you can shake a stick at. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun world and I always like seeing how many different ways you can turn common tropes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On another hand&amp;hellip; man Rachel is kind of an idiot sometimes. She&amp;rsquo;s so absolutely sure shre&amp;rsquo;s right even when &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em> around her is trying to get her see the truth. Oy that was frustrating. One would htink that trying to set out on her own would make her a little more risk averse&amp;ndash;but I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s not in the cards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And oh, that climax. This is most certainly going to come back and bite Rachel. But honestly, what other choice did she even have?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a fun series and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to keep going. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lies Sleeping</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/05/lies-sleeping/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/05/lies-sleeping/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Faceless Man on the run&amp;ndash;and trying to ring in&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> some new form of chaos to bring London to its knees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along the way, we&amp;rsquo;ll bump into new characters and, even better, fill in a few more holes in the histories of others. Each step we get closer to Molly&amp;rsquo;s tale is well appreciated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And man. Lesley has some trauma to work through. I love the fact that she&amp;rsquo;s not completely evil and off the deep end, but trying desperately (in her own way) to do the right thing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dead Witch Walking</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/02/dead-witch-walking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/02/dead-witch-walking/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Making a spell is easy. It&amp;rsquo;s trusting you did it right that&amp;rsquo;s hard.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Another new (to me) urban fantasy in a &amp;rsquo;the supernatural world has been made public&amp;rsquo; world? Yes please!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, we have Rachel a witch and, as of the start of the story, bounty hunter. Frustrated with her job, she decides to quit.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I sighed. I hated the maze of bureaucracy with a passion, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found the best way to deal with it is to smile and act stupid. That way, no one gets confused.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And in this world, you just &lt;em>don&amp;rsquo;t do that&lt;/em>. So now she&amp;rsquo;s gone from bounty hunter to having a price oh &lt;em>her&lt;/em> head, backed only by her friend(ish) and former co-worker, living Vamp Ivy and Jenks&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, a four-inch tall pixie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, she&amp;rsquo;s also stumbling into a super natural drug trade, a whole rat fighting ring (from impressively up close and personal), and summoned demons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rachel is a lot of fun. Perfectly competent and willing to fight for it, even if things don&amp;rsquo;t always go right. I enjoy Ivy, even if she&amp;rsquo;s still mostly closed off through this book. Room to grow. And Jenks is hilarious. &amp;ldquo;You think my kids just popped out of the ground?&amp;rdquo; and all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The worldbuilding is a lot of fun. I always like trying to figure out what&amp;rsquo;s diffrerent about this particular urban fntasty world and there is plenty of that here. Born vampires&amp;ndash;&lt;em>living&lt;/em> and only turning more traditional after death. Pixies and fairies, running their own smaller scale wars over garden space. Genetic engineering run amuck&amp;ndash;leading to a perfectly reasonable fear of tomatoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s quite a a world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it&amp;rsquo;s fun to have the main character be a witch. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely certain how much of a witch&amp;rsquo;s magic is natural versus learned just yet, but mostly human magic user is always a fun point of view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far I&amp;rsquo;m cautiously optimistic. I do love a good urban fantasy. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun world (with openly acknowledged supernatural characters!) with fun characters and a lot of room to grow. And grow it did&amp;ndash;with 18 out as of now&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Taskmaster Australia: Series 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/02/taskmaster-australia-series-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/02/taskmaster-australia-series-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have no idea how I ended up watching season 2 of Taskmaster Australia before Season 1, but go with it! It&amp;rsquo;s not like there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>that&lt;/em> much of an overarching plot between seasons that you have to keep up with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And man, this is a fun bit. Another series, another Taskmaster! And another assistant!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tom (Gleeson). And lesser Tom (Cashman) are a lot of fun together. I love that lesser Tom can never keep a straight face when teh contestants screw up. It&amp;rsquo;s delightful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And oh the cast was a lot of fun. Anne and Lloyd as a couple on the show together made for some great moments. Wil and Tom being old friends is a dynamic we&amp;rsquo;ve seen before in the British version but it&amp;rsquo;s always fun. Josh was quite a wildcard at times. And Jenny was one of the reasons I came to this version of the show&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen her acts on YouTube before and she&amp;rsquo;s a wonderfully weird mix and has a lot of those &amp;lsquo;young enough to make the other contestants feel old&amp;rsquo; moments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, another great season of Taskmaster. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to catch more of the Australian version! LIke season 1 &amp;#x1f604;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2025 Book Bingo</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/01/2025-book-bingo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/04/01/2025-book-bingo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s do it again (again (again (again)))!&lt;/p>

I loved the worldbuilding and main character, I think if anything, it&amp;rsquo;s far too short as a novella. I wanted more!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Although, from what Teshar had heard, every pyramid was intended to be entered. People would want to bring offerings for the dead Emperor, servants would want to tend things every once in a while; a lot of people prayed to past Emperors, because they were easier to talk to than the pure gods, and more accessible than the living Emperor or Empress.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The ever escalating tension of who Teshar (our main character) is and what she did to deserve to be treated like she is is fascinating (especially when you get to the why). I enjoy seeing the magic of the world escalating as we get to the obvious &amp;lsquo;Teshar must save the day&amp;rsquo; conclusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;my mother, bless her kind, silly soul, once pointed out to me that pretty women look like everyone else, whereas beautiful women look like themselves&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Overall, a fun story (that could have been longer). It&amp;rsquo;s always interesting to find a solid self-published and little reviewed work just like this! Worth a try.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Snow Crash</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/28/snow-crash/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/28/snow-crash/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We are all susceptible to the pull of viral ideas. Like mass hysteria. Or a tune that gets into your head that you keep humming all day until you spread it to someone else. Jokes. Urban legends. Crackpot religions. Marxism. No matter how smart we get, there is always this deep irrational part that makes us potential hosts for self-replicating information.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a bit of straight up dystopian cyberpunk, straight out of the 90s. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see the mix of hope and fear when it comes to technology&amp;ndash;virtual realitiies as both a way to dream and a means of control; a patchwork of corporate strongholds, each sovereign in their own right; a nuclear sidecar; a floating city circling the Pacific Ocean. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is America. People do whatever the fuck they feel like doing, you got a problem with that? Because they have a right to. And because they have guns and no one can fucking stop them.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And then add on to that a mix of memes (in the &amp;lsquo;viral/self-propagating idea&amp;rsquo; rather than quickly spreading joke images) and linguistics. The Tower of Babel and ancient Sumerian. &amp;lsquo;Programming&amp;rsquo; the human mind. It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating idea, even if the fine details feel a bit off at times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then characterwise. Oof. Hiro is a nerd power fantasy. He&amp;rsquo;s the best at sword fighting and a world class hacker and always wins.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Also his name (or at least the name he goes by) is Hiro Protagonist. A bit on the nose?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did really enjoy Y.T. though. 15 year old skater courier chick, street surfing and hitching rides on passing cars (etc). She&amp;rsquo;s a fun and high energy&amp;ndash;and it&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird that&amp;rsquo;s she&amp;rsquo;s only 15.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It was, of course, nothing more than sexism, the especially virulent type espoused by male techies who sincerely believe that they are too smart to be sexists.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Overall, a neat story and a decent example of cyberpunk moving into the 90s&amp;ndash;which admittedly I haven&amp;rsquo;t read much of. It&amp;rsquo;s been on my to-read list forever and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have finally read it!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Eyes Are the Best Part</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/28/the-eyes-are-the-best-part/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/28/the-eyes-are-the-best-part/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A salty liquid trickles down my throat. The outside is crunchy cartilage. I jam it into my left cheek and bite down with my molars; jellylike matter explodes within my mouth.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Whelp.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is most definitely a horror book. Not in the &amp;lsquo;jump and scare you&amp;rsquo; sort of vibe or really even the &amp;lsquo;serial killer is coming for you sort. But an ever building sense of what is real and what isn&amp;rsquo;t, body horror, and what-the-heckery? This book has &lt;em>that&lt;/em> in spades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s all built on a foundation of a messy home life going multiple periods of transition all at once. A feeling of alienation. Sexism and racism, sometimes subtle, sometimes &lt;em>not&lt;/em>. Learning to deal with (or not) their changing world(s).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How do I explain to her that the home I miss isn’t a place? It’s a time when my life made sense. When things made sense.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Characterwise, I think Ji-won&amp;rsquo;s point of view did a good job of being just as (eventually) freaked out as the reader is getting as her life gets upended. That, I appreciated. And I really feel for her mother and sister, both before the events of the story and just maybe even more after&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New mother&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend George is&amp;hellip; kind of cartoonish, but dealing with a divorced mother and a man who will say the right things? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s part of the mess of the situation, no?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then new school friends Alexis and Geoffrey. I &amp;hellip; the change with Geoffrey felt like Ji-won reacted before she knew what might be going on there. And perhaps I missed something, but&amp;hellip; he did not deserve everything he got. Which I suppose leads all the more into the horror of it all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Island in the Sea of Time</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/24/island-in-the-sea-of-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/24/island-in-the-sea-of-time/</guid><description>&lt;p>What if the modern day island of Nantucket was transplanted whole and complete 3000 or so years into the past.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty much the entire basis of the setting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From there, you get a book ranging from &amp;lsquo;how do we survive&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;we can&amp;rsquo;t change anything?!&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;how do we stop one of our own from building his own empire and taking over the world&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As one does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The historical basis is pretty interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s not a period I know &lt;em>terribly&lt;/em> much about&amp;ndash;although to be fair, there are a few cultures here that had to be invented mostly whole cloth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like the builders of Stonehenge&amp;ndash;they never wrote anything, so we have only scant records of what they might have been like&amp;ndash;or the writers of Linear A and B (the former only deciphered in the 50s and the latter having not done yet).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But then you have fascinating bits&amp;ndash;like you can&amp;rsquo;t very well trade with the local Native Americans for corn&amp;ndash;it won&amp;rsquo;t spread to this part of the world for thousands of years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The linguistics alone&amp;ndash;learning to speak various languages to various people was particularly interesting to me. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot to go from the idea that modern Lithuanian may be the closest to proto-Indo-European to being able to speak it, but for the sake of the story, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The survival aspects are a combination of &amp;lsquo;go humanity&amp;rsquo; and a bit much at times. The idea that they just so happen to have all the experts they could possibly need&amp;ndash;ancient fishing and farming, blacksmithing, metalurgy, chemistry. Nantucket is not &lt;em>that&lt;/em> big. And lucky they just so happened to bring back the Coast Guard&amp;rsquo;s one large sailing ship with them. But again, it&amp;rsquo;s a story. Everyone trying and then&amp;hellip; just dying out wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be nearly as interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One interesting aspect of the story was that we &lt;em>never&lt;/em> really learn (at least in this first book) &lt;em>why&lt;/em> or &lt;em>how&lt;/em> the island was sent back in time. Are they actually in their own past? Or in some alternate reality? But &amp;hellip; does it really matter? Again, it&amp;rsquo;s a story. The survival and exploring the world as it was is the point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I actually kind of like that we don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>need&lt;/em> to know why any of this happened. Just enjoy the ride. I would like to see how things change over a much longer time period&amp;ndash;but I imagine that&amp;rsquo;s a much harder bit of research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall an interesting book. Quite long. I&amp;rsquo;ll prob ably read the sequels at some point but not at the moment. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Dark Talent</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/23/the-dark-talent/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/23/the-dark-talent/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Some of you have been waiting for years to read this, the final volume of my autobiography.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I cannot really imagine that being the last book. Or at least the last one that would be published for another 6 years! Now, in hindsight, it&amp;rsquo;s obvious (and my kids&amp;rsquo; totally already knew), but man. That&amp;rsquo;s NOT AN ENDING.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Fine,” Grandpa said. “You fetch your evil Librarian mother from the jail. I’ll go warm up the giant penguin!”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Ahem.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Well, that was fun,” Grandpa said as he climbed to his feet. “Anyone dead?”&lt;br>
“Does my pride count?” Draulin asked, dusting herself off.&lt;br>
“I don’t think so,” Grandpa said. “I killed that years ago. Dif, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but shoving my grandson out of planes is usually my job. So next time, kindly refrain until I give the word.”&lt;br>
“Sorry, sir,” Dif said, looking abashed.”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The Dark Talent sees Alcatraz. Sans Dark Talent, off on a mission to save the world &amp;hellip; and to save the girl. Just don&amp;rsquo;t let Bastille hear you say that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a lot like the rest of the series. New Smedrys (oh Dif), new worldbuilding (the HIBRARY! Beneath Washington DC!), new schenanigans (that is &lt;em>quite&lt;/em> a library; also, rocket powered penguins), and a big new battle at the end (leading up to that oft forementioned SACRIFICE UPON AN ALTAR OF ENCYCLOPEDIAS).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it&amp;rsquo;s not the ending. And the ending can more than tell you that, which&amp;hellip; is honestly getting kind of old.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s doubly painful since not only did it end quickly, but it also ended painfully. In a series where guns put people in comas and main characters have magic powers seemingly purposely designed (hmm) to get them out of trouble&amp;hellip; well, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a shock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of fun and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to where in the &lt;em>world&lt;/em> the series will &lt;em>actually&lt;/em> end&amp;hellip; For real this time? Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Ruthless Lady's Guide to Wizardry</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/13/the-ruthless-ladys-guide-to-wizardry/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/13/the-ruthless-ladys-guide-to-wizardry/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a fun story (and a great cover and title &amp;#x1f604;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, take a struggling thief/con artist (with a tendency towards fire magic), give her a job bodyguarding a soon to be married young Lady and&amp;hellip; see what happens. There are some crazy fight scenes, a few light plot twists, a skeletal mouse that goes BONG&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and &amp;hellip; perhaps a chance to fall in love&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Characterwise, man this is quite a cast. We have the Delly&amp;ndash;our protagonist thief that can light things on fire&amp;ndash;but the supporting cast are even better. Winn. A part troll illusionist/brawler&amp;ndash;with quite the accent and past. Mrs. Totham, the &lt;strike>Necromancer&lt;/strike> Body Scientist. The academic. The lady. The mother.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course Buttons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that one for you to discover, but each time I the narrator read &amp;lsquo;Buttons said, “Bong.”&amp;rsquo; I found myself grinning. It&amp;rsquo;s just weird and delightful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Settingwise, it&amp;rsquo;s quasi-Victorian, which is a lot of fun. The language is a bit weird at times, with quite a few unexpected &amp;lsquo;fucks&amp;rsquo; jumping out at you.. but apparently that&amp;rsquo;s about when the term really started to take off and branch out, so&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;her perception of egregious enfucktation in her current, present, and unfortunate familial circumstances&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun setting though, going from the cities you most often see in a Victorian style out into the country and back. I want to see more of this world!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plotwise, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect the &amp;lsquo;protection&amp;rsquo; mission itself to take up such relatively little of the book. It&amp;rsquo;s more an inciting incident than anything, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad for it. When we moved on from that&amp;ndash;I was not at all ready to move on from this book. It&amp;rsquo;s all fairly straight forward (I expected a late book twist that never really materialized).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, that was yet another delight of a book and if anything in this review struck your fancy&amp;ndash;well worth the read!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: This is apparently a sequel of sorts? Oops. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, it&amp;rsquo;s more set in the same world with minor crossovers. But I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to go back and read it now!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Small Miracles</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/11/small-miracles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/11/small-miracles/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Chocolate shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a sin at all. Everyone deserves a bit of chocolate.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Gadriel, a former (now fallen) Guardian Angel owes her angelic bookie&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. And all she has to do to come clear is to tempt one sinless mortal&amp;ndash;Holly Harker. Should be easy, it&amp;rsquo;s what she does now&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So of course wacky hijinks ensue, things go wrong, people get hurt (not badly, it&amp;rsquo;s not that sort of book), and just perhaps&amp;ndash;everyone comes out of it a bit better than they went in.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Believe me, plenty of people claim they love someone because they get the warm fuzzies around them - but love is something you do. Quite often, it&amp;rsquo;s something you choose.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s such a fun reading, reminding me fairly strongly of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/24/good-omens-the-nice-and-accurate-prophecies-of-agnes-nutter-witch/">Good Omens&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Both in theme, but also in style. It&amp;rsquo;s a little bit irreverent, a little bit touching, and a lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Structurally, the near constant footnotes detailing what is/isn&amp;rsquo;t a sin (points, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/the-good-place/">The Good Place&lt;/a> style) and the running score for Holly and her niece are a lot of fun. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that to work as well in an audiobook as it did, but each time I heard that little chime, I got a little smile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, another good read (on a bit of a run of those!). Well worth a try.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Someone You Can Build a Nest In</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/08/someone-you-can-build-a-nest-in/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/08/someone-you-can-build-a-nest-in/</guid><description>&lt;p>This book is &amp;hellip; a weird mix of horror and romance, cozy and queer and &lt;em>weird&lt;/em> all at once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, your main point of view is this shape shifting monster who eats people&amp;ndash;who the author does &lt;em>quite&lt;/em> a job of making you &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> for, especially as&amp;ndash;between the whole eating people thing&amp;ndash;she ends up finding a family of her own and perhaps even falling in love.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not at all where I would have expected the story to go from just the title and cover (and oh, that is a delightful cover).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It does get a weird bit &amp;lsquo;modern&amp;rsquo; feeling at time, especially when Shesheshen (the monster protagonist) oscilates between having no idea how humans human (I get it, I really do)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner,” Homily said, hand going to her throat through the scarf. “I get self-conscious.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“If you weren’t conscious of yourself, who would you be conscious of?”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;to feeling &lt;em>strongly&lt;/em> about consent quite a number of times.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Then she realized the human woman was waiting for consent. Shesheshen sank more under her witch’s hat, and extended a foot. Once it was offered, Homily patted one of her meaty hands on Shesheshen’s calf. Why was she doing that? And why did it feel pleasant?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a concept worth enforcing, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite shake the feeling that it just didn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit the whole &amp;lsquo;monster who doesn&amp;rsquo;t get humans&amp;rsquo; thing and it jumped out at me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, I love how &amp;lsquo;alien&amp;rsquo; Shesheshen is (when she&amp;rsquo;s not thinking about consent). She doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have a body of her own, building it around whatever she eats (or finds lying around). The descriptions of how she builds around organs and puts them to her own use gets awfully gory at times, but is also a lot of fun to read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s yet another fun read and if you don&amp;rsquo;t mind a bit of gore and a weird horror/romance mix, it&amp;rsquo;s well worth it. None too shabby for a debut! (First novel; Wiswell has a few published shorts)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: I &amp;hellip; did not expect to find this was written by a man.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nine Goblins</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/06/nine-goblins/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/06/nine-goblins/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/t.-kingfisher/">T. Kingfisher&lt;/a> is a lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Smart goblins became mechanics. Dumb goblins became soldiers. Really dumb goblins became officers.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s this delightful little story about a world where Goblins are at war with the Humans and Elves. It&amp;rsquo;s told from the point of view of a ragtag group of Goblins who suddenly find themselves &lt;em>far&lt;/em> behind enemy lines, having to ally themselves with &amp;hellip; a veterinarian of all things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s quite a funny book; the humor reminds me a lot of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/discworld/">Discworld&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;take that as the compliment it is. I love reading about all the goblins. They are most &lt;em>certainly&lt;/em> a wacky bunch of characters&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Wherever a goblin happens to live, he complains about it constantly. This is actually a sign of affection. A desert goblin will complain endlessly about the beastly heat and the dreadful dryness and the spiky cactus. He will show you how his sunburn is peeling and the place where the rattlesnake bit him and the place where he bit the rattlesnake. He will be thoroughly, cheerfully, miserable.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh, and of course the teddy bear&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The bear not only had a set of stripes sewn on his arm, it was possibly the first teddy-bear in history to have received a medal for service to the elven nation.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And the contrast of an Elven veterinarian, getting into all the dirty, messy, ugly things vets have to do (when Elves normally only concern themselves with that which is fair beautiful and true) is great fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a quick read (147 pages) and well worth the fun. Give it a try!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/indiana-jones-and-the-temple-of-doom/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/indiana-jones-and-the-temple-of-doom/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="temple-of-doom">Temple of Doom&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Temple of Doom has some major middle film issues going on. Both &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/24/indiana-jones-and-the-raiders-of-the-lost-ark/">Raiders of the lost Ark&lt;/a> and The Last Crusade are far better films. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say Temple of Doom is bad, just lesser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Actionwise, there&amp;rsquo;s a ton. Gun fights, bailing out a plane, tons of bugs, several fights in a mine, and a giant drop? There is barely time to breathe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Real world ethicswise&amp;hellip; this is even worse than Raiders, which is saying something. There are a fair few &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; racist, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo; moments and a helping of &amp;ldquo;are they just evil for the sake of bring evil?&amp;rdquo; I suppose one can always go with the &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s an action movie, don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it&amp;rdquo; mindset.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Orconomics</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/orconomics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/orconomics/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Not all who wander are lost; some are on quests.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That was a very strange book. More than anything, it felt like &amp;lsquo;what if all of the more &lt;em>game&lt;/em> parts of Dungeons and Dragons were real, what would that change about the world?&amp;rsquo;. Oh, and dig into the economics of it along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We literally have an adventuring industry with heroes funded by corporate interests buying stakes in the eventual loot. Some sort of &amp;rsquo;level&amp;rsquo; system where you can turn in records of kills for advancement. Noncombat Paper Carries (NPCs).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a D&amp;amp;D satire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the biggest weakness to me was more one of expectations. I actually expected it to go even more into the economics (that don&amp;rsquo;t really make &lt;em>any&lt;/em> sense) of a adventuring based society. It&amp;rsquo;s there, but it could have been so much more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, I did enjoy the book, it was a fun read and the sense of humor was on point. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to check out the sequels at some point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Robogenesis</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/robogenesis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/03/04/robogenesis/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And now the story begins for the last time.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So. That hint that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t all over? That was just the beginning.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We are all expressions of our own minds, projected onto the world.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The idea that the AI that lead to the end of the world wasn&amp;rsquo;t a unique event&amp;ndash;just one that happened to go particularly sideways is a fascinating one. The story of people trying to rebuild in the ruins&amp;ndash;only for another war to sweep over what&amp;rsquo;s left is terrifying. And the &amp;lsquo;what comes next&amp;rsquo; of animal like machines, augmented humans, and self-aware / free robots is a fascinating basis for a story.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What is a mind, but a pattern? My mind or yours. Man or machine. Simply an arrangement of atoms. Each of us, a unique expression of the mind of the universe.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Honestly, I still think that &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/robopocalypse/">Robopocalypse&lt;/a> could stand as it&amp;rsquo;s own&amp;ndash;and was the stronger book. But if it had to have a sequel, this was an interesting one. Now that we have it (and that I&amp;rsquo;ve read it!) I feel like we&amp;rsquo;re going to need at least one more. There are just so many ideas here, we need to go another step further!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But instead of the end, I’m pretty sure I found myself at the start of something.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hanging Tree</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/28/the-hanging-tree/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/02/28/the-hanging-tree/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Jeremy Beaumont-Jones had been lucky enough to be born rich. He wasn’t in the mad oligarch class but once you’re past a certain point, the sheer weight of your money sucks in wealth like a financial singularity. If you’re sensible enough not to blow it on race horses, cocaine or musical theatre, then it becomes a perpetual-motion money making machine.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The power of money&amp;ndash;and those with power of their own, which tends to lead to money in it&amp;rsquo;s own ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Peter getting caught right up to it, a favor called in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a whole mess of the posh/upper class world of London and all the problems that come with this&amp;ndash;and how much they expect to be able to pay their way out of anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It took the Fire Brigade a day and a half to secure the remains of the house enough to recover Crew Cut’s body, which was described by Dr Jennifer Vaughan as ‘suffering from crush trauma’ and by Dr Walid as ‘mostly flat’.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well. Almost anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoy seeing more of Guleed, both in her role as a cop but also her getting more into the magical world&amp;ndash;at least by proxy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see more of Lesley. That&amp;rsquo;s such a mess throughout all of these books&amp;ndash;and I really don&amp;rsquo;t know where we&amp;rsquo;re going from there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And to finally face off more literally face to face with the Faceless Man? Awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The plots and sudden resolutions continue in this book. At this point, I&amp;rsquo;m mostly used to it&amp;hellip; but only mostly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Once the telephone had been invented, it was only a matter of time before the police got in on the new technology and, first in Glasgow and then in London, the police box was born. Here a police officer in need of assistance could find a telephone link to Scotland Yard, a dry space to do “paperwork” and, in certain extreme cases, a life of adventure through space and time.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s delightful.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
