&lt;p>It seems to me after a fellow has been mutinied against three or four times, there is something to it besides bad luck.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Convicted of Treason in Napoleonic Era Britain? Where else to go next but&amp;hellip; Australia!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s another travelog of a book, showing off yet another continent, although this time without much in the way of native dragons at all. We get a lot of very minor politics, a very long chase sequence across much of the continent following a stolen egg, a few interesting newly hatched dragons (probably the highlight of the book honestly). I do miss a lot of the old crew, but it&amp;rsquo;s something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notice anything missing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s painfully little in the way of big Napoleonic battles (with dragons!). Slightly more exploration of Chinese dragons and that end of the world, but not that much more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In theory, it&amp;rsquo;s a way for Laurence to deal with his actions in previous books&amp;hellip; but we&amp;rsquo;ve already done a chunk of that in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/13/victory-of-eagles/">Victory of Eagles&lt;/a> and we really don&amp;rsquo;t get much of it here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Really, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem quite like something we need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward. Fingers crossed.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I am sick of the quarrels of nations and kings, and I would not give a ha&amp;rsquo;pence for any empire other than our valley, if that can content your ambition.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s funny. It&amp;rsquo;s touching. And it&amp;rsquo;s a delight to read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Voilá. Tress of the Emerald Sea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a really good book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Comics Iron Man: Armor Wars</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/19/ultimate-comics-iron-man-armor-wars/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/19/ultimate-comics-iron-man-armor-wars/</guid><description>&lt;p>There’s so much to unpack from the events of Ultimatum…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead let’s introduce some new foe in the Mandarin. Hacking in and taking over Stark Tech. The Iron Man suit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neat idea but feels incomplete. Both in what I expected post Ultimatum and in the resolution.&lt;/p>

And to make it worse…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimatum-x-menfantastic-four-textbundle-9587e2.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have zealots blaming all mutants and going on a rampage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much death.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And on the Fantastic Four side:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimatum-x-menfantastic-four-textbundle-24175b.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mole Man and Grimm, going in. Such a weird time for it.

That’s a thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wrapped up in the events of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/16/ultimate-spider-man-volume-22-ultimatum/">Ultimate Spider-Man&lt;/a>, we have Ultimatum: Magneto flipped the poles and killed millions—including a number of heroes we know. Knew.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a bloody transition. A lot of it feels more designed to sock than anything. And it certainly does that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this were the beginning of the Marvel Ultimate Universe… the fallout could have been fascinating. I just hope what’s left is worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 22: Ultimatum</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/16/ultimate-spider-man-volume-22-ultimatum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/16/ultimate-spider-man-volume-22-ultimatum/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that escalated quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-spider-man-v22-textbundle-15de64.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seems Magneto decided to kill everyone. Good times. Oy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s quite the sudden tonal shift. So much death and destruction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given enough time to breathe, this could be quite a story line. I’m not confident it will though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Origins</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/15/ultimate-origins/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 00:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/15/ultimate-origins/</guid><description>&lt;p>And now we learn…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-origins-textbundle-5be231.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How it’s all connected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s an awful lot of a story. The origin of super heroes and mutants in the entire Ultimate Marvel Universe. And the Black Panther. And the Hulk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a lot for one volume and… I really wish they’d established this earlier. It’s different enough to make a fascinating world and we’ve only gotten hints thus far. I want more! And we’re near the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a side note (minor spoilers!), tying the origin of super soldiers to military experimentation of a young black man against his will… that’s kind of gross. It feels like taking a dark truth and trying to make something better of it. But there’s not enough room for the nuance that would need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimatum: March On Ultimatum</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/15/ultimatum-march-on-ultimatum/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/15/ultimatum-march-on-ultimatum/</guid><description>&lt;p>More Annuals! Mixed stories!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>X-Men/Fantastic Four hints at Ultimatum. Everything goes wrong. And a team back to stop it… but no luck there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Captain America. And really the origin of Ultimate Black Panther. Is that all we’ll get of him?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hulk. Naked. Fights. Eats. That’s really it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spider-Man and MJ being teenagers. Cute. But hardly earth shattering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, as always, a weird mix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>City of Night</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/15/city-of-night/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/15/city-of-night/</guid><description>&lt;p>And so we continue with the adventures of Helios né Frankenstein and all the troubles he&amp;rsquo;s causing for modern day New Orleans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of the main plotlines, we get a lot more of Randall Six and Arnie. I like the story in general, but the pacing is strange, stretching across two books and then sort of ending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We get Helios and yet another Erika, along with all sorts of things starting to go wrong with the New Race. It&amp;rsquo;s pushing increasingly into Horror, especially Body Horror, and I like it. The only gotcha is that it feels rather weird for it all to be going wrong &lt;em>now&lt;/em>. I do like seeing more variations and points of view among the New Race. They&amp;rsquo;re not all the same, no matter how much Helios wants them to be and that is fascinating. Especially when you bring Deucalion into the mix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We get more of Carson and Michael, now off the rails and going straight cop turned vigilante. It makes sense, given the complete inability to know who&amp;rsquo;s Old and who&amp;rsquo;s New, but it still is a bit jarring. I do love their banter. At this point, I wholly expect one or both not to survive the series, which is a bummer, but expected in this sort of thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the weirdest thing about this book (and the series thus far) is that it really all feels like one very very long single novel. The &amp;rsquo;endings&amp;rsquo; do tend to end at least one plot thread, but there are always new things being brought up and random threads ending well before the end of a book. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I care for the style. But I&amp;rsquo;m too into the series now to stop!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All that being said, it&amp;rsquo;s a good book and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to where we go next!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 19: Absolute Power</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/14/ultimate-x-men-vol.-19-absolute-power/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 May 2023 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/14/ultimate-x-men-vol.-19-absolute-power/</guid><description>&lt;p>What if mutants… but &lt;strong>more&lt;/strong>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s the idea behind the Banshee drug. Quite the power up for a lot of them. And secrets for the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interesting story, if weird time. Needs more space to breathe. If it were a standalone or much earlier in the series, this would be a much better volume. As it is, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite feel right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Fantastic Four, Volume 11: Salem's Seven</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/14/ultimate-fantastic-four-volume-11-salems-seven/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 May 2023 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/14/ultimate-fantastic-four-volume-11-salems-seven/</guid><description>&lt;p>You know, that might actually be my favorite Ultimate Fantastic Four? Team drama, mysterious new threat, tie backs to Atlantis and Namor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s actually pretty good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Weird. But good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a pity that this is the last of the series&amp;hellip; Why couldn&amp;rsquo;t we have had more of this? Or really a more coherent storyline throughout the run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Ultimates 3: Who Killed the Scarlet Witch?</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/13/the-ultimates-3-who-killed-the-scarlet-witch/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/13/the-ultimates-3-who-killed-the-scarlet-witch/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Ultimates are back! With new faces, new foes, and new deaths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More or less.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s certainly a jam packed volume with lots of twists and action. Really, it’s mostly a prequel to Ultimatum. And that’s okay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Victory of Eagles</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/13/victory-of-eagles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/13/victory-of-eagles/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If they cannot be woken to a natural affection for their country, such as we feel, it is our fault and not theirs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Where Laurence is condemned for Treason for trying to prevent war crimes and Temeraire is on his own&amp;ndash;and ends up starting a sort of soft revolution among the dragons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s quite a story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Laurence having to go against loyalty, against king and country was a Big Thing last book, so seeing the fallout of that goes about as expected. It&amp;rsquo;s dark. And we&amp;rsquo;re still not done with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And seeing Temeraire come into his own, basically take over the breeding grounds, and speak for dragonkind in Britain? Love it. Plus, a whole bunch of Temeraire point of view! Couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it any other way and the voices are as distinct as I expected. But it&amp;rsquo;s lovely to see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s quite a book and well worth the read in the series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward to see what happens next!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>[Maximus] put his head down and said in a conspiratorial whisper, “Tell Temeraire that Lily and I have not forgotten our promise; we will not let them hang you at all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Laurence stared up at the immense Regal Copper. All his crew looked deeply distressed, as well they might, the outlaw remark being perfectly audible several clearings over.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It continues being delightful to read about the largest dragons trying to be sneaky.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 21: War of the Symbiotes</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/12/ultimate-spider-man-volume-21-war-of-the-symbiotes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/12/ultimate-spider-man-volume-21-war-of-the-symbiotes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Venom and Carnage!

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-spider-man-v21-textbundle-a1a552.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a fascinating story line. Quintessentially Spider-Man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Setting up something big too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 20: And His Amazing Friends</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/12/ultimate-spider-man-volume-20-and-his-amazing-friends/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/12/ultimate-spider-man-volume-20-and-his-amazing-friends/</guid><description>&lt;p>A cute volume. Mostly turning down the stakes a bit. Give them all a chance to be normal. Go on a beach date. Reveal the hidden mutant among them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You know. Normal teen stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add to that Kitty, Peter, and MJ all learning how to get along together?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 18: Apocalypse</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/10/ultimate-x-men-vol.-18-apocalypse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/10/ultimate-x-men-vol.-18-apocalypse/</guid><description>&lt;p>Apocalypse!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That would be more exciting if he got more than a couple issues to build up—or be defeated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I suppose I’ll hold judgement until we see what comes next, but I’m underwhelmed.&lt;/p>

It starts with a marriage, imprisonment, and money problems and only gets crazier from there.
Death is a theme as well, not once but twice. I get that sometimes actors move on , but they really did Matthew dirty with that one&amp;hellip;
Overall another solid season and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to what happens now!

So of course it&amp;rsquo;s up to Laurence and Temeraire to save the day!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As it seems to be the case in each of these books past the first, we&amp;rsquo;re off on an adventure! Novik really does like showing off the world as it was in that time period. This time around, to the Cape of Africa (and eventually across the interior). We get to meet new and interesting friends, enemies, and dragons along the way; along with all sorts of fun* moral problems of the era (and in general).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another solid entry in the series and worth the read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!

&lt;p>No. Not that one.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I don’t know if any of this is something that’s happened before in Spider-Man story lines, but it’s certainly not one I’ve heard of before. Probably the biggest shake up I’ve had through the Ultimate Marvel read through.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well well worth the read!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Fantastic Four, Volume 10: Ghosts</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/04/ultimate-fantastic-four-volume-10-ghosts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/05/04/ultimate-fantastic-four-volume-10-ghosts/</guid><description>&lt;p>Will he ever learn?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>No.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No he will not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, a quick trip to Siberia to meet the Crimson Dynamo, and a few other bizarre friends. Then in the other half, Reed Richards’ project comes to fruition—Giant Cube of Doom. Thanos. The end of the world.&lt;/p>

In space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not at all what I expected, but at the same time, kind of awesome. I mean, look how it starts:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You wake in an agony of resurrection, gasping after a record-shattering bout of sleep apnea spanning one hundred forty days. You can feel your blood, syrupy with dobutamine and leuenkephalin, forcing its way through arteries shriveled by months on standby. The body inflates in painful increments: blood vessels dilate, flesh peels apart from flesh, ribs crack in your ears with sudden unaccustomed flexion. Your joints have seized up through disuse. You’re a stick man, frozen in some perverse rigor vitae.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vampires did this all the time, you remember. It was normal for them, it was their own unique take on resource conservation. They could have taught your kind a few things about restraint, if that absurd aversion to right angles hadn’t done them in at the dawn of civilization. Maybe they still can. They’re back now, after all—raised from the grave with the voodoo of paleogenetics, stitched together from junk genes and fossil marrow steeped in the blood of sociopaths and high-functioning autistics. One of them commands this very mission. A handful of his genes live on in your own body so it too can rise from the dead, here at the edge of interstellar space. Nobody gets past Jupiter without becoming part vampire.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is just a cool concept. The entire idea that vampires are real. The justification that they evolved torpor/hibernation to deal with not out-compenting and wiping out humanity. A natural aversion (leading to seizures) when viewing right angles (like&amp;hellip; crosses) that isn&amp;rsquo;t weeded out because nature doesn&amp;rsquo;t have many right angles. Super hardy, high processing, great for space travel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s so cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And on top of that, we have virtual worlds, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">the Chinese room argument&lt;/a> (with an entire character base on it), normalization of multiple personalities, and all sorts of other interesting people and brains on the trip. Every single one of them is atypical in some way (or multiple ways) and digging into that is a large part of the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we haven&amp;rsquo;t even gotten to the aliens yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, it&amp;rsquo;s a whole bunch of fascinating concepts all packed into a gloriously dense book. I could see any one of these carrying a novel, let alone all of them. The setting being deep space on (or beyond) the edge of the solar system makes everything claustrophobic, while the flashes of backstory give a bit of time to recover (and explain what in the world is going on with some of these characters).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed it. If any of the above intrigues you, give it a try. I will say though; warning: this is a weird book. Your milage may vary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Fantastic Four, Volume 7: God War</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/30/ultimate-fantastic-four-volume-7-god-war/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/30/ultimate-fantastic-four-volume-7-god-war/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Fantastic Four get &lt;strong>weird&lt;/strong> yo.&lt;/p>

I have just not watched many movies this year. I really should work on that.
So let&amp;rsquo;s start with one of the weirdest and violent musicals out there: Sweeney Todd. I recently came across a YouTube video How the Music Spoils Sweeney Todd (and why that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing) that reminded me how much I enjoyed the music when we did it in high school (Not even kidding, not sure how that got approved&amp;hellip;).</description></item><item><title>Black Powder War</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/29/black-powder-war/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/29/black-powder-war/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“One man can go where a group cannot, and manage on very little, particularly a rough adventurer such as he. More the point, he risks only himself when he goes: you much consider that in your charge is an inexpressibly valuable dragon, whose loss must be of greater importance than even this mission.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, pray, let us be gone at once,&amp;rdquo; said the inexpressibly valuable dragon, when Laurence had carried the question, still unresolved, back to him. &amp;ldquo;It sounds very exciting to me.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/15/his-majestys-dragon/">His Majesty's Dragon&lt;/a> started strong, with dragons fighting great battles in the Napoleonic wars. In &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/21/throne-of-jade/">Throne of Jade&lt;/a>, we took almost an entire book to get to get to (and then some of that to) experience China. So now in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/29/black-powder-war/">Black Powder War&lt;/a>&amp;hellip; we get to come home?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More seriously, it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite a story. Laurence and Temeraire get a super important message (tm) that there are dragon eggs that need picked up in Istanbul. There isn&amp;rsquo;t time to book a ship&amp;hellip; so they&amp;rsquo;re about to travel the Old Silk Road across a huge chunk of land.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Annuals, Volume 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/29/ultimate-annuals-volume-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/29/ultimate-annuals-volume-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fantastic Four is a duplicate and the Ultimates (focussed on Captain America) was weird, but I really enjoyed the X-Men and Spider-Man issues.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 15: Magical</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/28/ultimate-x-men-vol.-15-magical/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/04/28/ultimate-x-men-vol.-15-magical/</guid><description>&lt;p>Uh oh.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We have a traitor in the Ultimates. Relationship issues abound (both Cap/Wasp and Iron Man/Black Widow). Death. Destruction. Mayhem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, otherworldly invsions!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s way too much for a single volume, but man does it hit hard. The only real question(s) I have are&amp;hellip; where in the world do you go after something like this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well worth a read, especially after the build up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ultimate Wolverine Vs.

&lt;p>Hulk got nuked. Of course it didn’t work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now it’s time to send something even more dangerous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a classic unstoppable force vs immovable object fight and pretty neat. And even then, a couple small twists.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“Well,” said Crowley, who’d been thinking about this until his head ached, “haven’t you ever wondered about it all? You know—your people and my people, Heaven and Hell, good and evil, all that sort of thing? I mean, why?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“As I recall,” said the angel, stiffly, “there was the rebellion and—”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Ah, yes. And why did it happen, eh? I mean, it didn’t have to, did it?” said Crowley, a manic look in his eye.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Anyone who could build a universe in six days isn’t going to let a little thing like that happen. Unless they want it to, of course.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Oh, come on. Be sensible,” said Aziraphale, doubtfully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“That’s not good advice,” said Crowley. “That’s not good advice at all. If you sit down and think about it sensibly, you come up with some very funny ideas. Like: why make people inquisitive, and then put some forbidden fruit where they can see it with a big neon finger flashing on and off saying THIS IS IT!?”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The ANTICHRIST is born. ARMAGEDDON is coming! And all that stands in the way (for better /and/ for worse) is an angel/demon best friend combo who happen to /like/ living here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh it&amp;rsquo;s so good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve read quite a bit of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/terry-pratchett/">Terry Pratchett&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/authors/neil-gaiman/">Neil Gaiman&lt;/a>, so reading a co-lab between them. Plus, I actually watched the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Omens-Season-1/dp/B089XW1Z6Y">show on Amazon&lt;/a> a while back, well before reading this book. From that order at least, it&amp;rsquo;s one of the particularly faithful and well done adaptations. Both being rather enjoyable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really can&amp;rsquo;t get Michael Sheet and David Tennant out of my head though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which is not a bad thing. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fun ride, political/religious in exactly that fun somewhat blasphemous irreverent sort of way. I enjoy watching the ever increasing highjinks, as more plots get involved. The hundreds of years descendent of the one truly accurate prophetess. The Witch Finder Army&amp;ndash;somewhat reduced in manpower. The Four Horsemen&amp;ndash;and the dedicated deliveryman who sets them on their way. Plus the Other Four. And of course, the Antichrist himself. All these powers&amp;ndash;and no one ever taught him how to use them.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Finally, it comes out that Hulk is still around. After murdering hundreds. And now Thor is off the team (by choice) and it’s less clear than ever if he’s Thor—or a meta human with some serious psychiatric issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love seeing the relationships in the series. Cap and Janet are great—I’m enjoying the slightly more unhinged / human Cap. Pym and Banner as science Bros with issues. Iron Man and Black Widow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“Those men want to take Laurence from me, and put him in prison, and execute him, and I will not let them, ever, and I do not care if Laurence tells me not to squash you,&amp;quot; he added, fiercely, to Lord Barham.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Laurence and the British Government may think that Temeraire was won fairly under the articles of war&amp;hellip; but the Chinese aren&amp;rsquo;t so sure. In an effort to appease them, off Temeraire and Laurence go, halfway around the world to see if they can&amp;rsquo;t convince them otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a number of parts to really like about this book: Getting to travel the world is neat. The difference of Chinese culture, especially around dragons is fun. I like the idea of basically a Napoleonic era aircraft carrier for dragons. There are other related big beasties in the world as well!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The discussions about slavery, the differences in culture between the British and Chinese, and what that might mean for dragons were fascinating. Especially having read &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/">A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians&lt;/a> not &lt;em>that&lt;/em> long ago, it was interesting to see another take on the same period&amp;ndash;especially when we randomly get news that Pitt has died.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course, the aforequoted relationship between Temeraire and Laurence. That&amp;rsquo;s really a great part of the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a downside, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit less action packed than the first book. We get a couple of big fights, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, but it&amp;rsquo;s got a low slower pace. A bit jarring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worth a read.&lt;/p>

One to remember and to warn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea that no one else has beaten Galactus is… nonsensical? Bit comics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vision… with a rather female form is an interesting choice. No reason not to choose either over the other when approaching Earth. But I expect that’s not why they (the writers/illustrators) did it…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ultimate-vision-textbundle-45ad5c.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now we get a quick aside with A.I.M. and a left behind splinter of Galactus. Neat story, if likely inconsequential to anything else.&lt;/p>

Galactus is here, ready to destroy the Earth and everything on it. It’s going to take Ultimates, Fantastic Four, and X-Men alike to save the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But at what future cost?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit sudden of an end and in prefer the setup of the previous two volumes, but it’s still solid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a number of potential far future issues laid out here. Curious what comes back to bite humanity’s collective behind.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now we get a hint at what it’s coming to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Hint: ☠️)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s pretty cool seeing the Ultimates and Fantastic Four team up this time. No X-Men though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
