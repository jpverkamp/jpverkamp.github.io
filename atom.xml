&lt;p>Miles? Oh my.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Haven’t seen him for &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/25/ultimate-end/">a while&lt;/a>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that went well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ms. Marvel, Vol. 5: Super Famous</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/27/ms.-marvel-vol.-5-super-famous/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/27/ms.-marvel-vol.-5-super-famous/</guid><description>&lt;p>And… swap. Continued volume numbering, new issue numbers. Same writer, new artists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ms-marvel-2014-v5-textbundle-e06382.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whoa, wait a minute. Less onward. More context!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ms-marvel-2014-v5-textbundle-3f430a.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay, so six months have passed. And it’s not just we the readers who missed everything—apparently Kamala’s been flaking hard as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ms-marvel-2014-v5-textbundle-044ab1.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>lol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, Tyesha!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ms-marvel-2014-v5-textbundle-ae6ea7.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which makes everything even more super busy! So of course…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ms-marvel-2014-v5-textbundle-99be6a.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yup. Bad idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ms. Marvel, Vol. 4: Last Days</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/25/ms.-marvel-vol.-4-last-days/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/25/ms.-marvel-vol.-4-last-days/</guid><description>&lt;p>The world… is ending.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Or at least that’s how it feels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Didn’t she know him for like… a couple days? I suppose it’s not that unusual. First times are so much bigger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But still.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ms-marvel-2014-v4-textbundle-c5a44b.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bigger problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, the dream team up!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s fun and exactly the sort of thing Kamala dreamt about! Even if the scale of it all… doesn’t really make sense. The end of the world looms and they’re starting with the looting?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But getting to the part of the story we saw in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/23/ms.-marvel/">the show&lt;/a>? “I know.” That’s the story I’m interested in!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A chaotic delightful mess of a story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Tropic of Serpents</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/23/the-tropic-of-serpents/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/23/the-tropic-of-serpents/</guid><description>A Natural History of Dragons set out an interesting world. It&amp;rsquo;s more or less our world (although with all the names rewritten, so you&amp;rsquo;re always playing a game so is &amp;lsquo;xxx&amp;rsquo; just like &amp;lsquo;yyy&amp;rsquo;), but with dragons. And of course the titular Isabela Trent just wants to study them, like any Natural Historian would!
Give me dragons any day; I understand their ways far better than those of my fellow human beings.</description></item><item><title>Dark Queen</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/22/dark-queen/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/22/dark-queen/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, that was an awful lot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Who are we kidding, we&amp;rsquo;re 12 books into a series, but not quite at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten this far, what are the chances that you&amp;rsquo;re going to stop now&amp;ndash;and you &lt;em>really&lt;/em> don&amp;rsquo;t want to, just in case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if you&amp;rsquo;re looking ahead to the end of the series before reading it to see if it&amp;rsquo;s still worth it&amp;hellip; well, so far it is!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All that being said&amp;hellip; man that was a lot.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ms. Marvel, Vol. 3: Crushed</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/21/ms.-marvel-vol.-3-crushed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/21/ms.-marvel-vol.-3-crushed/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ms-marvel-2014-v3-textbundle-0c1f99.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well. As far as hooks go, that is most certainly one of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pity it’s only got one volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than that we get the introduction of Kamran—instant meetcute with Kamala, what can possibly go wrong—inhuman strife, and… a S.H.I.E.L.D. crossover?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ms-marvel-2014-v3-textbundle-94662b.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looks fun. Maybe I’ll read that one next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, everything feels like it’s flying by, in the way of comics. It takes too long to illustrate an entire volume, so everything gets crammed together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ms. Marvel, Vol. 2: Generation Why</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/20/ms.-marvel-vol.-2-generation-why/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/20/ms.-marvel-vol.-2-generation-why/</guid><description>&lt;p>You know all those rumors about pet alligators flushed down the sewers?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ms-marvel-2014-v2-textbundle-34caa9.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yeah, they generally fail to mention the freakin laser beams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Comics are weird. Volume 2 and we’re already with the crossovers (hallucinatory Avengers don’t count). So many crossovers. But they’re cute! And it’s still mostly Ms. Marvel calling the shots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A solid volume 2! Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ms. Marvel, Vol. 1: No Normal</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/18/ms.-marvel-vol.-1-no-normal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/18/ms.-marvel-vol.-1-no-normal/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ms. Marvel! I watched the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/23/ms.-marvel/">TV show&lt;/a>, so this should be about the same right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ms-marvel-2014-v1-textbundle-8f46f0.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well… things get weird. Mostly due to an origin not entirely in the movies. So it’s a bit different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the feel?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/ms-marvel-2014-v1-textbundle-e10d87.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s still street level, teen girl, dealing with being from a Pakistani family/Muslim born in America.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-2015-v13-textbundle-fbd41f.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s all quite exciting in all the best science fantasy sorts of ways Star Wars has to offer!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quite a way to end this particular series. Whatever could be next?!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars Vol. 12: Rebels and Rogues</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/14/star-wars-vol.-12-rebels-and-rogues/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/14/star-wars-vol.-12-rebels-and-rogues/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>All of our lives, we have fought this war. Tonight I believe we can end it. Tonight is not an accident. There are no accidents. We have not come here by chance. I do not believe in chance. When I see three objectives, three captains, three ships. I do not see coincidence, I see providence. I see purpose. I believe it our fate to be here. It is our destiny. I believe this night holds for each and every one of us, the very meaning of our lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Wait. No. Wrong franchise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-2015-v12-textbundle-e31864.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It doesn’t help when that’s their disguise garb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luke’s off to lure some imperial probes away, Han and Leia are going to try to trick criminals (and perhaps an old ex) into fighting a war for them, and Chewie and C-3PO? Well, they have a planet to blow up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A thrilling… part one!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars Vol. 11: The Scourging of Shu-Torun</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/12/star-wars-vol.-11-the-scourging-of-shu-torun/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/12/star-wars-vol.-11-the-scourging-of-shu-torun/</guid><description>&lt;p>Princess Leia has a plan!

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-2015-v11-textbundle-7a366e.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(It&amp;rsquo;s even better, as Luke was just looking for them&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s quite cinematic. Fetch quests, exotic locales, a crazy multipliprong battle with stakes both huge and personal…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I quite enjoyed this one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Star Wars Vol. 10: The Escape</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/11/star-wars-vol.-10-the-escape/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/11/star-wars-vol.-10-the-escape/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/books/attachments/star-wars-2015-v10-textbundle-743363.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if what could happen were more akin to a forced vacation? Stranded alone on a world with a strict isolationist policy. No transmitters. No traffic in or out other than every six months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat story. Interesting to see which of our heroes adapts to the quiet life&amp;hellip; and which very much do not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus, hints of the wider Star Wars universe. Lightsaber proof shields. Massive beasties to hunt&amp;ndash;in defense of the town. A Jedi in love. And maybe a way away from all that war&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Taskmaster: Series 14</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/10/taskmaster-series-14/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/10/taskmaster-series-14/</guid><description>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s such a delight of a season, mostly due to Fern Brady, although I enjoyed the entire cast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The contestants:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dara Ó Briain - Goes about the weirdest things with a smile on his face.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fern Brady - Fern is delightful. She&amp;rsquo;s a fun one to look up her independent work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>John Kearns - He constantly had the look of &amp;lsquo;what have I gotten myself into&amp;rsquo;. Really the whipping boy for this season.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Munya Chawawa - Zimbabwean ___. Hda a fun way of working around the tasks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sarah Millican - Alternatively delightfully dry and actually angry at times.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One more!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Beginning</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/09/the-beginning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2024 00:00:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/09/the-beginning/</guid><description>&lt;p>And it ends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And a new day begins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t really a book with much action (although there is some). It&amp;rsquo;s really more of an epilogue. How things wrap up and what happens next. It&amp;rsquo;s not always something you get in a series and I appreciate it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The end of the end? Weird. Undoes a bit of the closure. But in a way, it fits?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Animorphs were an amazing read when I guest found them years (decades?) ago now. This is my third time reading them. They may be dated at times, but oh, they hold up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A story of teenagers growing up far too fast. Fighting a war. Saving the world. And paying for it all in blood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well worth the read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Ellimist Chronicles</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/09/the-ellimist-chronicles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2024 00:00:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/09/the-ellimist-chronicles/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My full name is Azure Level, Seven Spar, Extension Two, Down-Messenger, Forty-one. My chosen name is Toomin. I like the sound of the word, which is all the reason you need for a chosen name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; name is Ellimist. Like Toomin, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean anything in particular. I just thought it sounded breezy. Never occurred to me when I chose the name that it would follow me for so long, and so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A world of flying crystals. Searchers, flying to the stars. A living moon. And all along, games. Games at an unimaginable scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps my favorite book of the whole series&amp;ndash;although it&amp;rsquo;s for the most part completely inconsequential to any of the other books. It explains a few things (that were acceptable not to explain) and builds more worlds (perhaps connecting things too much). Still, I quite enjoy this one. And it&amp;rsquo;s at a good point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The beginning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the end.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Answer</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/09/the-answer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2024 00:00:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/09/the-answer/</guid><description>&lt;p>My name is Jake.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My name is Jake Berenson. The days of secrecy, of lurking in the shadows are over. The Yeerks know my name. They know my height, weight, eye color, Social Security number, and favorite foods. At long last they know the word Animorph, Marco&amp;rsquo;s word for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve fought them for more than three years. I was just thirteen when I started. I&amp;rsquo;m sixteen now, though that fact, like so many facts, has been deliberately obscured in the secret accounts we&amp;rsquo;ve kept.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a sixteen-year-old kid named Jake Berenson, and I am the leader of the Animorphs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>More battles, bigger than ever before. Characters we&amp;rsquo;ve met long ago, back where we&amp;rsquo;d never expect them. And choices. Choices that could charge the whole galaxy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It all comes back to the power to morph.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the choices the Animorphs will all have to make. And live with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or die by.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One more book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Sacrifice</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/09/the-sacrifice/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2024 00:00:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/09/the-sacrifice/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Yeerks are in the open now. Rounding up people by gunpoint and sending them by subway to the Yeerk Pool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Animorphs need to do something about it&amp;hellip; but at what cost?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add on to that, it finally comes out. Cassie stopped Jake from killing Tom&amp;ndash;and that&amp;rsquo;s why the Yeerks can morph now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ax&amp;rsquo;s reaction is&amp;hellip; interesting. We often get fairly alien beliefs from him and other Andalites. But this one, this is interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But really, it all comes down to this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>None of us are adults. The others are now of the age to be attending what humans call &amp;ldquo;high school.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Man. They&amp;rsquo;re so young.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Absolute</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/08/the-absolute/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 00:00:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/08/the-absolute/</guid><description>&lt;p>The National Guard is mobilizing!

&lt;p>It went poorly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But nothing is going well any more. So now, perhaps, it&amp;rsquo;s time for some reinforcements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only reinforcements the Animorphs can universally assume not to be Controllers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s quite the idea&amp;ndash;and quite the risk, both for the Animorphs and for Applegate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But as Jake said, it&amp;rsquo;s our planet. &lt;em>All&lt;/em> of our planet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Diversion</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/08/the-diversion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 00:00:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/08/the-diversion/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another step further.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No, Rachel. We retreat,&amp;rdquo; Jake answered. &amp;ldquo;A tactical retreat. Save the army. Live to fight another day. But a toothbrush would be good. And extra deodorant. We&amp;rsquo;ll be out there a while.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s like a series of heists. Barely planned, absolute chaos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost all successful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And still things escalate.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Never Tilting World</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/07/the-never-tilting-world/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/07/the-never-tilting-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of world building. Start with elemental magic, nothing &lt;em>super&lt;/em> new there (although acid is always a fun one). Add in an ancient prophecy and twins where only one can rule. Still not that unusual.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then defy the prophecy and &lt;em>literally stop the world spinning&lt;/em>, leaving one side a desert scorched by a never ending noon, the other frozen in perpetual night.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We’re chasing a dying sea under an endless sun that kills us with a thousand little cuts every day. There’ll be nothing left soon. Nothing but sand and bone.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now that&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool worldbuilding, especially for a fantasy world (it&amp;rsquo;s something you see slightly more in sci-fi).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now on top of that, you have a ruler in each world, each with a daughter. Well, you can guess what probably happened and who these two are (remember those twins I mentioned?), but none of them know that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So you get a fascinating ride as each realized just how screwed up their own corner of the world is, falls in love (there is more than a touch of romance in this book)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If the choice is between me risking my life and losing you, I’d choose the first.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>When the dead find words, the goddess and the Devoted son will meet atop a fish not a fish, on a sea not a sea. It is she who travels to the endless Abyss, and it is he who guides her.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I quite enjoyed this book. It takes a bit of getting into and the leads are&amp;hellip; more than a touch Young Adult/&amp;lsquo;chosen one&amp;rsquo;ish, but it&amp;rsquo;s still a fun read/listen.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Among all the Animorphs, they&amp;rsquo;d all say that there&amp;rsquo;s only one who might be truly sad if the war ended tomorrow: Rachel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But even the most gung ho fighter is eventually going to burn out. Perhaps &lt;em>especially&lt;/em> them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An intense book with all the surreal uncertainty of the worst nightmares.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Resistance</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/06/the-resistance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 00:00:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/06/the-resistance/</guid><description>&lt;p>Things continue to escalate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The free Hork-Bajir under attack, willing to die to defend their homes. With some Animorph help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And two hundred years ago, but not all that different, Union soldiers under attack, willing to die to defend their homes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With some freed slaves willing to help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end, it&amp;rsquo;s the same battle, time and again. And the same people&amp;ndash;black, white, and Hork-Bajir alike&amp;ndash;willing to step up to fight&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat structure, interweaving the two battles. A solid read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Deception</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/06/the-deception/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 00:00:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/06/the-deception/</guid><description>&lt;p>Things continue to escalate&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Finally, Jake spoke. His eyes were dull but his voice was firm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Things are different,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;From now on, we take what we need. We do what we have to do. No matter what the consequences.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Jake . . .&amp;rdquo; Cassie began.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s only one morph that will get us thousands of miles out to sea in the time we have left,&amp;rdquo; he added. &amp;ldquo;Human.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of amazing how out in the open/direct thins things are getting. We have less than ten books left, but still. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An intense book. And more to come.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Revelation</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/05/the-revelation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 00:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/05/the-revelation/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What are you calling your discovery?&amp;rdquo; I heard Nora ask.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t really know,&amp;rdquo; Dad said tentatively. &amp;ldquo;What can you call something that is nothing at all?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything on TV. An old Star Trek. A new Star Trek. My life was plenty sci-fi. How about some Real World?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What could you call it?&amp;rdquo; Dad continued. &amp;ldquo;Zero, I suppose. Zero-space.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Uh oh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And so we&amp;rsquo;re really in the endgame now. Things are falling apart. The Yeerks have all the power. And the Animorphs&amp;hellip; well, they have that they&amp;rsquo;ve always had.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Unexpected</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/05/the-unexpected/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 00:00:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/05/the-unexpected/</guid><description>&lt;p>I feel like Unexpected could really be the title to about half of these books. Maybe more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing leads to another, everything goes wrong, and Cassie is off to SYD-South Something Dakota. Right? Right&amp;hellip;?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But hey, kangaroo morph!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s basically no impact on the greater Animorph&amp;rsquo;s story, but sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s all right. And it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to get a fairly straight forward Cassie story with the existential dread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No worries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Test</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/05/the-test/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 00:00:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/05/the-test/</guid><description>&lt;p>Man, Tobias doesn&amp;rsquo;t get a break.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Civil war is coming, Andalite,&amp;rdquo; she began. &amp;ldquo;Yeerk versus Yeerk. We&amp;rsquo;ve had enough of the petty Visser fights, the favoritism, the punishments . . . the Council makes us sick.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And all that from a rather unexpected source.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s wrong. I won&amp;rsquo;t. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to judge you guys, but you&amp;rsquo;re talking about strategy and risk like this is some computer game. Like there aren&amp;rsquo;t others involved. Have you forgotten that we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be in this to save lives?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now it makes sense. Totally a trick. But how? When? Why?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Journey</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/04/the-journey/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 00:00:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/04/the-journey/</guid><description>&lt;p>And&amp;hellip; Helmacrons. Again. We just saw them in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/01/the-hidden/">The Hidden&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still not &lt;em>nearly&lt;/em> my favorite alien species in these books. At least this time, they get to go all Magic School Bus!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Medusa</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/04/medusa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/04/medusa/</guid><description>&lt;p>Swallowed by a sperm whale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s quite the introductory seen. Starts with whaling, full on Moby Dick (I should read that at some point). It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting story, with just enough weird science to see where it&amp;rsquo;s going in the &amp;lsquo;present day&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Corona Virus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This&amp;hellip; felt all the more real in this post Covid world. And a sign of how it could have been so much worse&amp;ndash;if only we didn&amp;rsquo;t have weird ocean life and a super well funded, run, and liked NUMA to save the world. 😄&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Hermaphrodite third triplet as a big bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; just lazy. The Chinese Triad / mafia stuff, pretty cool. This reveal? Meh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, at this point? It&amp;rsquo;s Clive Cussler. The books are enjoyable enough, but I want to listen to something else for a while. So I&amp;rsquo;m moving on to something else. Perhaps one day I&amp;rsquo;ll return.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cold Reign</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/03/cold-reign/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/03/cold-reign/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Janie, we need to get this guy out of the cage. Suggestions?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Am Beast. Not Jane.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>What am I? Chopped liver?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Do not need liver chopped. Have fangs and claws to chop liver.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I do so enjoy the Jane/Beast dynamic. By far the best part of these books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise, we have vampires coming back from the dead again that never should have, the Euro Vamps actually showing up after how many books, a crazy supernatural storm, and oh some many more timey whimey shenanigans. I&amp;rsquo;m still not entirely sure what to think about it. It&amp;rsquo;s unique, for sure. But oh, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>major&lt;/em> power creep on Jane&amp;rsquo;s part. I suppose we&amp;rsquo;re getting on towards the end of the series and that&amp;rsquo;s to be expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than that, my other favorite part of these books is the every growing Yellowrock clan. I never would have guessed it when I started this series, but the found family dynamic is so wonderful to read. They&amp;rsquo;re all interesting and I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to care for them all at least some fraction as much as Jane does. I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;hellip; not looking forward to some inevitable betrayals/deaths. :(&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other other than that, there is one problem I think I&amp;rsquo;ve been having with this series:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Gee was a bird, an Anzu, a creature once worshiped as a storm god. We had recently hunted together, both of us in Anzu form. I’d had a good long look at Anzu DNA when I shifted into the form, and that DNA was not from Earth, but it did look a lot like arcenciel DNA.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>When&amp;hellip; did this happen? I don&amp;rsquo;t think I remember it. There are about a billion short stories, so perhaps in one of those, but it feels kind of weird to have the mainline novels not more stand alone than that. Is it just me? (Or did I just forget something?)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But really, it&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful series and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to where it goes from here!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Familiar</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/02/the-familiar/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 00:00:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/02/the-familiar/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I fingered the suit, and then it hit me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I knew what was going on here. It had finally happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I knew it was only a matter of time, what with the pressures of leadership, the violent battle, the endless fights against a strengthening enemy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d finally been driven to a complete psychotic breakdown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d gone crazy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And this was my padded cell.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Not &amp;hellip; exactly?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a very weird book. A what if sort of future and even at the end, it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely clear what&amp;rsquo;s happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially back to back with &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/02/back-to-before/">Back to Before&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve done this sort of thing before, but usually with at least some small amount of closure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not my favorite.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Back to Before</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/02/back-to-before/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 00:00:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/02/back-to-before/</guid><description>&lt;p>What if&amp;ndash;instead of walking through that fateful construction site&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ellimist and Crayak/the Drode are at it again. Giving Jake a chance at a normal life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But all is not as it seems&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, I see it now, I see it now,&amp;rdquo; the Drode said, ignoring Marco, ignoring all of us. &amp;ldquo;Subtle as always, Ellimist. Your meddling came before, didn&amp;rsquo;t it? How could we not have seen it? Elfangor&amp;rsquo;s brother? His time-shifted son? This anomalous girl here? And the son of Visser One&amp;rsquo;s host body? A group of six supposedly random humans that contains those four! You stacked the deck!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Did I?&amp;rdquo; The Ellimist laughed. &amp;ldquo;That would have been very clever of me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>You know? So far as justifications for the coincidences that make stories just work&amp;ndash;that&amp;rsquo;s actually a sneakily good one. The Animorphs are talented and more than a little lucky. But all along, someone (something?) has been stacking the deck to help them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like it. More than I expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Other</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/02/the-other/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 00:00:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/02/the-other/</guid><description>&lt;p>An Andalite on TV! Almost right on the heels of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/01/the-arrival/">The Arrival&lt;/a>. Bit weird that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting look into Andalite preconceptions though:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;No. The Yeerks would have no use for his body. He is completely useless as a host.&amp;gt; Ax waved his frail hand in a dismissing motion. &lt;Without a tail blade he cannot fight. And it is obvious this vecol is incapable of morphing or he would have restored his tail from his own healthy DNA.>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And&amp;hellip; is directly contrary to the idea that your original body doesn&amp;rsquo;t heal (mostly recently in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/01/the-hidden/">The Hidden&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; how does the DNA know your age? Or current haircut? Or if you got a tattoo? Or the progress of a genetic disease&amp;ndash;even if the disease is in your DNA, why is the damage has already caused.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting look into another portion of Andalite society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, we get:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Tobias glared. &amp;lt;Okay, I&amp;rsquo;m getting a complex over here. I&amp;rsquo;m a nothlit. A freak. Whatever. My best friend is an alien with blue fur. My girlfriend is human - when she isn&amp;rsquo;t in morph. How about we don&amp;rsquo;t talk about &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; anymore. Or &amp;ldquo;average&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;natural.&amp;rdquo; Please.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hidden</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/01/the-hidden/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 00:00:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/03/01/the-hidden/</guid><description>&lt;p>Helmacrons. Not my favorite when they showed up in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/12/the-suspicion/">The Suspicion&lt;/a>, not much better now. At least it&amp;rsquo;s only their tech though&amp;ndash;the ability to track morphing energy&amp;hellip; and the blue box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An interesting enough plot, but there&amp;rsquo;s a spoilery twist (see below) that &amp;hellip; I just didn&amp;rsquo;t think worked. it didn&amp;rsquo;t quite work with the established world building and I doubt will be used again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it goes.

&lt;p>Sort of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things go well.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Rachel whirled around. Her face red with anger. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m through taking orders from you,&amp;rdquo; she said through clenched teeth. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m through with Marco and his stupid jokes. I&amp;rsquo;m through with Cassie&amp;rsquo;s hypocrisy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cassie took a broom from the corner and began to sweep up the glass. &amp;ldquo;Count me out, too,&amp;rdquo; she said softly. &amp;ldquo;If this war is unwinnable, how do we justify killing Hork-Bajir? Basically, they&amp;rsquo;re prisoners of war. Innocent victims.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marco thrusts his hands into his pockets. &amp;ldquo;Guess I&amp;rsquo;m out, too. I&amp;rsquo;m going to enjoy what time I&amp;rsquo;ve got left. Acquire a surfer dude chick magnet. Hang out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It would be nice to meet some fine upstanding examples of Andalite society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today&amp;hellip; is not that day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a solid story. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice contrast to Ax&amp;rsquo;s earlier conflict between his people&amp;hellip; and his people.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Factorio Achievement Hunting: Lazy Bastard / 100%</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/29/factorio-achievement-hunting-lazy-bastard-/-100/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/29/factorio-achievement-hunting-lazy-bastard-/-100/</guid><description>&lt;p>And here it is, &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/11/factorio-achievement-hunting-there-is-no-spoon/">a month and a half later&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="assets/00-all-done.png" alt="all-done">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We did it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time, I had a quick save game in order to crank through a train in 90 minutes (that was actually closer than the 8 hour run, believe it or not) and then it&amp;rsquo;s time for the long hall. I have two achievements left to achieve:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Mass production 3 - produce 20M green chips (I had ~13M before this run)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lazy bastard - win the game with no more than 111 hand crafts&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; actually not &lt;em>that&lt;/em> hard, just long. There are guides out there for what your 111 hand crafts can be. With recipe changes, you only need 103. Then you can turn off hand crafting permission (&lt;code>/permissions&lt;/code> is allowed) and&amp;hellip; just do everything by hand. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need biters on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All together, it took about 28 hours to set up my rocket for Lazy Bastard&amp;hellip; but I wanted that one to be last.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It may have taken another 30 hours to complete the remaining 7 million circuits&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Weakness</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/29/the-weakness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/29/the-weakness/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oof. Two in a row I don&amp;rsquo;t overly care for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, we have Jake out of town&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;A vote,&amp;gt; Tobias said. &amp;lt;It&amp;rsquo;s the only way.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marco snorted. &amp;ldquo;Beautiful. Let&amp;rsquo;s see. We&amp;rsquo;ve got Rachel&amp;rsquo;s best friend and her bird-friend and Ax isn&amp;rsquo;t voting . . . forget it, man. I&amp;rsquo;m out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marco turned to me and bowed. &amp;ldquo;Congratulations, your highness. Your wish is my command.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And for some reason Rachel steps up. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to agree with Marco too strongly here&amp;hellip; but this is a bad idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hit and run, almost get killed, learn a lesson.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And away we go!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Mutation</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/28/the-mutation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/28/the-mutation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Okay, just &lt;em>how many&lt;/em> alien (and otherwise) species &lt;em>are&lt;/em> there on the Earth?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, at lesat one more&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At some point, it seems we have to do every possible historical weirdness. Which this time involves Atlantis. And it&amp;rsquo;s every bit as weird and fishy as you might expect &amp;rsquo;the Animorphs do Atlantis&amp;rsquo; would be&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Look, I don&amp;rsquo;t know about anyone else, but I believe in listening to my instincts. And my instincts are saying, &amp;lsquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve done enough, Marco. Go home. Play with the stupid poodle. Do some homework.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I get the same feeling, Marco,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;But we almost got killed trying to take out the Sea Blade. I don&amp;rsquo;t want a rematch. I want it sunk. I want to know it&amp;rsquo;s sunk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; not my favorite. Weird worldbuilding that should have a lot more impact and/or repercussions than it does.

&lt;p>I mean NUMA/Kurt Austin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But they even call it out in the book, &amp;rsquo;the Phoenicians again'.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Really, this book is kind of hilariously on point when it calls out it&amp;rsquo;s own weirdness. We have a big bad:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The big man with the face like an evil baby.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And the other big bad later saying:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I have no intention of taking over the world like some James Bond villain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Uh huh. Sure now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than that, the plot is interesting enough. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I like or not how many of these books are tied together (all about pre-Columbian contact and the Phoenicians). It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, I&amp;rsquo;ll give them that. But the additions of new (weirdly named) secret societies, secret messages, and hidden gold mines? I&amp;rsquo;ll take it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And more Thomas Jefferson than you can shake a stick at. It&amp;rsquo;s not James Bond, it&amp;rsquo;s National Treasure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a decent enough story, but I think &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/01/11/lost-city/">Lost City&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/03/polar-shift/">Polar Shift&lt;/a> may have spoiled me a bit. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VISSER</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/28/visser/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/28/visser/</guid><description>&lt;p>Told from the point of view of Visser One (former and, for the moment, current). On trial, in front of the Council of Thirteen themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I spoke to the holographic representation of the Council. Thirteen Yeerks in various host bodies: Nine Hork-Bajir, two Taxxons, and two whose host bodies were so concealed that I could not guess at their form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They were dressed in dark red robes, so dark that they were almost black. They stood, motionless, held in place, suspended by gravity-neutral fields, fed by a continuous refined current of Kandrona rays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Hork-Bajir-Controllers wore a lightweight mesh beneath their robes to keep the wrist and arm blades from slicing through the robe&amp;rsquo;s fabric.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The two Taxxon-Controllers were bloated, monstrously inflated versions of the great centipedes. Both were attended by Gedds, ready with freshly killed meat to feed the eternal hunger that not even a Yeerk inside that feverish brain can control. Their ceremonial robes were as large as sails, wrapped around the raised front third of their bodies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They were light-years away, of course. They would see me, my host face and body in three dimensions. They could also watch my vital signs, translated into universal equivalents. Blood pressure, heart rate, hormone production, all reduced to digital readouts a billion miles away. And they could, with a thought, call up whatever data had been compiled on specific events or locations or individuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I really do enjoy the worldbuilding here and I&amp;rsquo;m a bit sad that this is about as much as we&amp;rsquo;re going to get about the Council.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, it&amp;rsquo;s yet another interesting point of view. Especially when you add in Visser One&amp;rsquo;s testimony&amp;ndash;the backstory of how the Yeerk invasion of Earth actually began.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Tentatively I reached toward the far side of the brain. I touched it. Made contact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fascinating!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was incredible. This second half of the brain was an almost mirror image, but not. It could have functioned all on its own, if necessary, and yet it was in some ways radically different in its memories, its sensory interpretation, even its will. Two almost entirely functional brains in one skull, communicating across a channel of nerves. Not a fully redundant system, almost a second, different brain!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s more interesting to think that humans are weird like that (and that is weird) or that seemingly no other species is!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoy all of the &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/reviews/series/animorphs-chronicles/">Animorphs Chronicles&lt;/a>. This is no exception.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Proposal</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/27/the-proposal/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 00:00:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/27/the-proposal/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My name is Marco.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But you can call me &amp;ldquo;Marco the Mighty.&amp;rdquo; Or &amp;ldquo;Most Exalted Destroyer of My Pride.&amp;rdquo; You can cower before my mighty thumbs and beg for mercy, but you&amp;rsquo;ll be crushed just the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For I am the lord of the PlayStation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pick a game. Any game. Tekken. Duke Nukem. NFL Blitz. Whatever. Practice all you want. I&amp;rsquo;ll still beat you. I&amp;rsquo;ll crush you like Doc Martens crush ants.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A bit dated, but not terribly so. I do like Marco&amp;rsquo;s points of view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, then things go wrong (otherwise there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be much of a book, now would there?):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My arms! They weren&amp;rsquo;t becoming wings! What was happening? I felt them stretching out in front of me. The skin on my hands turning brittle, like armor. Fingers merging, becoming two barbed claws.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something was wrong!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My face . . .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A pinprick on each cheek! Two long whisker-like hairs sprouted outward. Instinctively, I swept them in front of me, gauging the wind, the temperature, sensing my surroundings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Antennae? Birds don&amp;rsquo;t have antennae!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dim eyes. Pincers. Antennae.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lobster?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was half-osprey, half-lobster?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A useless combination of mismatched parts.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a standard &amp;lsquo;discover a high powered Yeerk that&amp;rsquo;s going to ruin everyone&amp;rsquo;s day, so let&amp;rsquo;s take him down&amp;rsquo; sort of plot. This time with more TV personalities. And a secondary plot of Macro&amp;rsquo;s dad moving on, which&amp;ndash;given the storyline of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/25/the-conspiracy/">The Conspiracy&lt;/a> and the upcoming &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/28/visser/">VISSER&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;is complicated at best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Ooookay,&amp;gt; Jake replied. &amp;lt;That could have gone better. Guess it&amp;rsquo;s time for Plan B.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Someday when this is all over people will ask us about the war against the Yeerks,&amp;gt; Tobias said. &amp;lt;Let&amp;rsquo;s leave this part out&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Another good one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially with&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Marco, if you&amp;rsquo;re there, pick up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mother.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be continued in . . . &lt;em>Visser&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;lt;An Arn, on Earth? Here? Why? That&amp;rsquo;s the question. What&amp;rsquo;s he up to?&amp;gt; Rachel wondered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;He had to come. Star Wars: The Phantom Menace isn&amp;rsquo;t coming out on DVD there for, like, two years. He buys up a bunch of copies here, takes &amp;rsquo;em home, makes a fortune.&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Good grief, Marco, you live science fiction, why do you want to watch science fiction?&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be dissing TPM,&amp;gt; Marco said. &lt;Cool is cool.>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; the Arn. Like I said &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/10/the-hork-bajir-chronicles/">The Hork-Bajir Chronicles&lt;/a> was among my favorites of these books, so following up on that storyline is pretty cool. Especially the the Animorphs getting a chance to go offworld entirely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And hey, let&amp;rsquo;s bring back the memory implant of Aldrea (the Andalite from the Hork-Bajir Chronicles, Seerow&amp;rsquo;s daughter) for good measure. Of course bringing back the dead to the source of some of their worst possible memories (although best too I suppose) can&amp;rsquo;t possibly go wrong&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a neat book. Bit weird, but I liked it. I hope something comes of it, but if it does, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember from last time I read these books. We shall have to see!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Illusion</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/26/the-illusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/26/the-illusion/</guid><description>&lt;p>Tobias just doesn&amp;rsquo;t get a break. (I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m saying that a lot recently).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, the Yeerks are working on an anti-morphing ray. And the Animorphs &lt;em>really&lt;/em> don&amp;rsquo;t want them to think &lt;em>that&lt;/em> works (despite the fact that&amp;hellip; they would really want to try it more than once. Or, despite the danger&amp;hellip; on Visser Three).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there&amp;rsquo;s an obvious answer. Who&amp;rsquo;s morph could they shine just about anything on and never get them to &amp;lsquo;de&amp;rsquo;morph?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tobias.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s actually kind of brilliant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Makes up a bit for the tone of the rest of the book. Man there are evil even by Yeerk standards in this book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Separation</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/26/the-separation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/26/the-separation/</guid><description>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; a really strange story. And hard to talk about without spoiling the main conceit, which they at least seem to want to keep semi-hidden.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Conspiracy</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/25/the-conspiracy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/25/the-conspiracy/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an odd one to pair with &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/24/the-reunion/">The Reunion&lt;/a>. In both cases, we have an Animorph with a family member controller. In both cases, it&amp;rsquo;s too close to home. But Marco made the call&amp;ndash;even if it&amp;rsquo;s going to tear him up later to do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now it&amp;rsquo;s Jake&amp;rsquo;s turn.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You know what Marco and I used to talk about? Whether Batman could beat Spiderman. Whether Sega was better than Nintendo. Whether some girl would rather go out with him or me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now . . .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What are we, anymore, Marco? What has happened to us?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He didn&amp;rsquo;t answer. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect him to. We both knew what had happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Man these books get dark.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s one reason I like them. They don&amp;rsquo;t get into everything, but they really do get into enough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Reunion</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/24/the-reunion/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/24/the-reunion/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;lt;Interesting,&amp;gt; Ax observed. &amp;lt;Bearded, white-coated creatures with hooves. And horns. Grazers. I would point out the similarities between the mountain goat and Andalites, except for my extremely disappointing experience with the cow.&amp;gt; (&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/17/the-experiment/">The Experiment&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so Marco&amp;rsquo;s mom is back&amp;ndash;and after the mess of &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/04/the-decision/">The Decision&lt;/a>, she&amp;rsquo;s not Visser One anymore. But if anything, that means that she hates Visser Three all the more&amp;hellip; and would stop at nothing to get back at him. Even if that means allying herself with the &amp;lsquo;Andalite Bandits&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marco of course deals with this in a perfectly reasonable and level headed manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What do you do when you have to make a decision, and each choice is horrible? What would you do, Rachel? If it was your mom or dad or sisters. What would you do, Xena?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rachel came back and sat beside me on the bed. She didn&amp;rsquo;t hug me. Rachel&amp;rsquo;s not a hugger. But she sat there with me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;One battle at a time, Marco. One battle at a time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an intense book and man I feel for Marco. Tobias and Ax are really going through some stuff, but they&amp;rsquo;re only sort of human any more. Of the remaining Animorphs&amp;ndash;well, I think that it&amp;rsquo;s Marco that&amp;rsquo;s gone through the most. And this book certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t go easy on him.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The First Journey</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/23/the-first-journey/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/23/the-first-journey/</guid><description>&lt;p>Huh, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know they made these!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Animorphs, but choose your own adventure style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neat idea, subpar execution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each of the &amp;lsquo;choices&amp;rsquo; has only one correct answer. There are no branches and every dead end sees you killed and reset. And even with that, it&amp;rsquo;s barely 3/4 the length of most of the Animorph books&amp;ndash;already short.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; meh? There are only two. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if I read the other.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Elfangor's Secret</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/22/elfangors-secret/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/22/elfangors-secret/</guid><description>Am I some kind of hideous freak of nature, a twisted concoction of mismatched parts?

Depends on the day. Depends on whether I&amp;rsquo;m with Melissa, wanting to make her happy, wanting her to hold my hand, &amp;hellip;
Way to bury the lede there.
So&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s another time travel story. Another Time Matrix story. Another Ellimist / Cyarak story.
The slightly more interesting bit this time is that time is wrong.</description></item><item><title>The Sickness</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/21/the-sickness/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/21/the-sickness/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You ever notice how many different ways there are to say &amp;rsquo;throwing up&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo; Marco asked as we passed Dunkin&amp;rsquo; Donuts, the first in the row of fast food places dotting the main street running through town. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s vomiting, of course. Hurling. Tossing your cookies. Puking, a classic. Ralphing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was glad Marco was filling up the silence. Even though I thought he could have come up with a better topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s cascading. But I prefer the terms that are more real. Like blowing chunks. Spewing your guts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marco took a deep breath and kept on talking as we made our way past Taco Bell. &amp;ldquo;Tangoing with the toilet. That&amp;rsquo;s a good one,&amp;rdquo; he said reflectively. &amp;ldquo;Technicolor yawn.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The one where everyone gets sick (Ax deathly so) and Cassie has to go on a solo rescue mission to the Yeerk pool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quite a story and quite a bit more Cassie than we often get. Being the action hero no less!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A solid one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Born on a Blue Day</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/20/born-on-a-blue-day/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2024/02/20/born-on-a-blue-day/</guid><description>You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be disabled to be different, because everybody&amp;rsquo;s different.
At the end of Look Me in the Eye, Born on a Blue Day is mentioned as another similarish memoir of growing up with Autism. I saw it was available as an Audiobook on Libby, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give it a try.
In a lot of ways, it&amp;rsquo;s a similar book&amp;ndash;they&amp;rsquo;re both memoirs after all and both of autistic individuals no less.</description></item></channel></rss>
