<p>Well. That's a lot of books.</p>
<p>I've read the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40346-the-dresden-files">Dresden Files</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10746.Jim_Butcher">Jim Butcher</a> a half dozen times already. Always room for once more!</p>
<p>More specifically this time around, I've been looking for audio books I can listen to while either commuting to and from work or during the slower times of work itself. The Dresden Files has the advantage there in that I've already read them so many times I can miss small sections without actually losing much in terms of overall plot. It also has the advantage of being narrated by the excellent <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/169487.James_Marsters">James Marsters</a>. Well worth it.</p>
<p>My thoughts on my n+1'th time through the series? Just as good as before. The first books are rough, but they just keep getting better. It's by a fair margin my favorite urban fantasy series. I'd probably go so far as to say my favorite series, full stop.</p>
<p>Individual reviews follow. There are a few spoilers for individual books and even more in later books for the earlier ones. You have been warned. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47212.Storm_Front"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/1-storm-front.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>And so it begins.</p>
<p>I've probably read this series roughly half a dozen times. This time I'm listening to them on audiobook. It certainly goes by quick.</p>
<p>Storm Front has a direct and mostly guessable plot, mixed in with hints at a much larger world to come. Although the story is straight forward, that doesn't mean it's boring. In fact, it helps to keep driving the story on page after page (minute after minute)?</p>
<p>The magic system isn't particularly well defined yet, which I'm not sure what I think about. I like magic systems with rules, even if I don't know them and I'm not sure that this world fits that. There are hints of a much much larger world to come though, so that's cool.</p>
<p>Characterwise, Dresden is a 'good guy' to a fault. Despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that he seems himself as an old-fashioned kind of chivalrous, he tends towards the sexist. I'd forgotten how blatant that is, especially in the early books. Part of it, I think is that we're entirely in Dresden's headspace and he still has a lot of growing up to do.</p>
<p>I know a fair few people that won't read the Dresden Files because of this. To each their own.</p>
<p>Other than that, Muphy has potential as a tough cop, but she isn't quite there yet. Macrone has the core of a 'mob boss who cares'. The bad guy(s) are fairly one dimensional, although there are hints of something more beyond them even this early.</p>
<p>Overall, Storm Front is the first book in a series and not nearly as strong as some of the later entries in the series, but it's a good start.</p>
<p>Onwards!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91477.Fool_Moon"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/2-fool-moon.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Two down.</p>
<p>This time around, we're dealing with werewolves. And not just stereotypical werewolves, but a small pile of different forms. People that turn into wolves, people turned into wolves against their will, magic item based wolves... It's a lot. It's getting close (if not outright blowing past) the 'kitchen sink' world building that's rather common in urban fantasy. On the other hand, it's neat to see a few different takes on werewolves.</p>
<p>Another neat beat of world building comes in the form of Chauncy, a civilized (seeming) demon with a British accent who apparently knows far more about the larger world and Dresden's part in it than anyone else we've seen. It'll be interesting to see how/if that comes back in the future.</p>
<p>After that, we get a bit of growth for Dresden. Although he certainly respects some women's abilities (Murphy for example), he'll turn right on and go on about wanting to protect them. There's also the sexual descriptions of just about every single female character we meet (with several of them ending up naked at various times, because werewolf).</p>
<p>As a counterpart, the only male character that we get described is Marcone, who always has eyes like dollar bills. This is mentioned oddly often. He's still one of my favorite characters in the series. We know that he's not a 'good' man by just about anyone's definition, but at the same time, he does have his own code that he will stick to. He could be a very powerful enemy--or ally.</p>
<p>Plotwise, there are a few more twists this time, partially coming from the number of different parties involved and partially because we're tied to Dresden's (flawed) point of view. It's a nice change from Storm Front.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a stronger story than Storm Front and an excellent sequel.</p>
<p>Onwards!</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91476.Grave_Peril"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/3-grave-peril.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>First there was a sorcerer. Then werewolves. Next up, ghosts and vampires. The Dresden Files certainly get around.</p>
<p>I already said it last time, but it applies again: Grave Peril is a much better book (in my opinion) than Fool Moon, which in turn is much better than Storm Front. I'm sure this won't be the same pattern forever, but it's impressive enough to carry through three books.</p>
<p>Next thought: Michael. Dresden is what many boys / young men want to be. He's a powerful loner who's out to save the day (more or less). Slightly older and wiser though (for some definitions there of), I really admire Michael. He has a rock solid faith in God (granted, it's a different sort of faith when God is quite obviously a force in the world)--even when doubting himself. He <b>will</b> protect those that need protecting and he <b>will</b> do the right thing.</p>
<p>There are a few other very cool scenes in this book: A showdown in a cemetery (it was a dark and stormy night). A vampire-hosted masquerade. A trip through the Fae realm. Dresden's mind. Dresden really letting loose and blowing things up. I enjoy both the worldbuilding that underlies each of these scenes combined with the descriptions to make them come to life in my head.</p>
<p>Here, we also see the world expanding. There are at least three different kinds of vampires with all of the politics that entails. Dresden has dealings with a powerful Fae. There's a very cool scene with a dragon (with the oomph to casually smack Dresden across the room). This is part of what makes me keep reading these books. It's a huge world that somehow manages to avoid (for the most part) feeling 'kitchen sink'y' (although I'm still not sure how).</p>
<p>There's also more of the same when it comes to a surprising number of characters ending up naked or at least mostly so. Less than Fool Moon (I think), but still. Add to that the seductive powers of the White Court...</p>
<p>On the weirder end, this is the first introduction we get to Dresden's subconscious. I'm not really sure what to think about it. It feels like there's more to it than just a hallucination, but it's hard to tell for certain.</p>
<p>Overall, as I said, a great read.</p>
<p>Onward!</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91478.Summer_Knight"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/4-summer-knight.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Sorcerers, werewolves, vampires... And now the Fae. We already had hints of it from the previous books, particularly in the guise of Lea--Harry's literal Fairy Godmother.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a very cool bit of worldbuilding. The Fae aren't particularly uncommon in Urban Fantasy and I really like the Dresden Files version thereof. They've even gotten to the point where they act as background knowledge when reading other series. If something isn't mentioned, I'll fall back to the Dresden Files as ground truth. It's just that solid.</p>
<p>Another nice bit is to finally see the White Council that we've heard about for several books. They're more or less what I imagined they would be in this world. A whole pile of different people and cultures brought together by a shared magic. And just like any other large group of people, there is politics.</p>
<p>Of course Dresden ends up smack dab between the two.</p>
<p>The plot is neat, with a few twists and a good number of players muddying the waters. It's interesting to see how even beings as elemental and unchanging as Fae can be twisted against themselves.</p>
<p>Cool scenes:</p>
<p>Dresden and Murphy fighting a giant plant monster at a Home Depot equivalent.</p>
<p>Meeting the crazy powerful (crazy and powerful) Fairy Mothers, the eldest of the queens.</p>
<p>That final battle in the sky.</p>
<p>The scope of the world keeps growing, revealing more and more of the things that go bump in the night (and that could tear Dresden limb from limb without breaking a sweat).</p>
<p>Also, Dresden finally told Murphy just about everything. About freaking time.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91479.Death_Masks"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/5-death-masks.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Dang. New favorite Dresden File. More of Michael and the introduction of my favorite baddies in the Dresdenverse.</p>
<p>What really makes Death Masks shine is the the characters:</p>
<p>First: The Archive. That's just a very cool (yet sad) idea all at the same time. The idea that there could be a being with the sum total of all human knowledge ... and that it's a little girl? Dang. I want to know more. How did the first Archive come to be? What exactly capabilities does she have?</p>
<p>Next, two more Knights: an atheist and an accidental Baptist. Both are interesting characters, especially in contrast to the much more stereotypical Knight of God Michael. I like both how Butcher gave them different voices and how Marsters (in the audiobooks) brought those voices to life. There's also an interesting contrast near the end of the book between Dresden and the Knights. It turns out that Dresden is not a 'good' person, at least not in terms of how the Knights see good. After all, payphones cost more than a quarter now.  ..</p>
<p>Then there's the Denarians. Fallen angels bound to the thirty silver given to Judas Iscariot? Dang. They have literal millennia of experience to bring to bear along with a human host, making them yet another upping on the danger scale. We only really get personality from their leader Nicodemus, but man is he an excellent villain. I do wonder if he's supposed to be the same member of the Jewish ruling council mentioned in the Gospel of John. I don't think that's been confirmed either way...</p>
<p>Finally we learn a fair bit more about Marcone. He remains the epitome of Lawful Evil: He has a strong code of ethics for what he will and will not do, but at the same time that code doesn't always (often?) align with what is legally or generally considered moral. He's a fascinating individual that way and honestly a lot more similar to Dresden than I think either of them would care to admit.</p>
<p>One thing that we haven't seen before in this book is a relatively explicit sex scene between Dresden and Susan. It's a definite step away from the fade to black and hints of the previous books, but I don't think it was over done. The most amusing part about it: the original idea for how to do it safely came from Michael's 14 year old daughter. I'd missed that the first few times reading this book.</p>
<p>My favorite scene in the books though? Dresden creates a tracking spell using a plastic duck that walks towards whatever it is tracking. He then later uses said duck as a fake gun to threaten someone. I love it.</p>
<p>Finally: random quotes of awesomeness:</p>
<p>"Better safe than exsanguinated"</p>
<p>"Sod works in mysterious ways."</p>
<p>"My faith protects me. Kevlar helps."</p>
<p><img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99383.Blood_Rites"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/6-blood-rites.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I still like Death Masks better, but Blood Rites is still quite good. We're back to big magical rituals (a five book cycle?) but also a bit of goodly hint of vampiric mayhem (the Black and White Courts this time around).</p>
<p>Of course, since it's the White Court, the entire plot this time has to revolve around a ritual curse targetting an adult film director. All righty then.</p>
<p>As I'd mentioned before, the best part of Death Masks was the characters. This time around, it had to be have been just random scenes.</p>
<p>Awesome scenes:</p>
<p>A fight with monkey demons whose primary weapon is... flaming monkey poo. Dresden has a quite literal fight with a literal monkey on his back.</p>
<p>An entropy curse that kills via whatever bizarre means it can access. Including... death via frozen turkey.</p>
<p>A big basement showdown with Mavra (she's back!)... And that wasn't even the climax of the book.</p>
<p>A big fight in a cave system while a bad ass demon summoning is going on.</p>
<p>That's not to say that there weren't a few neat character moments. We learn a lot more about Thomas, Murphy, and Kincaid. Oh, and Dresden has a magic dog now.</p>
<p>One interesting thing that we really haven't seen <em>that</em> much of prior to this is lasting consequences, other than the war with the Red Court. Things are changing in the Dresdenverse. The big example: Dresden's hand. Smaller examples that I'm sure will mean more later: Dresden learns a lot more about his mother/family and about some of the more troublesome parts of the White Council (the Blackstaff). Slightly terrifying example: He Who Walks Behind.</p>
<p>My other favorite part of the Dresden Files in general and this book in particular:</p>
<p>"I put the ick in magic."</p>
<p>"I the hell am Harry."</p>
<p>"Proof is something you use with rational people. Right now you aren't."</p>
<p>Love it.</p>

<p>Ooh fun. A big bad necromancer (in this world, the driving force behind World War I) got taken out by the White Council decades ago. Unfortunately, he left behind a small pile of minions, who of course came calling on Dresden's home turf.</p>
<p>This is right in the running with Death Masks for my favorite thus far. There's a reason it has the highest Goodreads ranking among the first ten Dresden books...</p>
<p>There are a whole pile of awesome baddies, united in their necromantic powers but each with their own twists. Butters gets a serious boost and a lot more importance. We see a bit more of Thomas and Dresden's growing relationship as brothers.</p>
<p>Another awesome part is the whole new twist to come about from Lasciel's coin from the ending of Death Masks. We saw it building a bit in the last book, but things are coming to a head hear. I'll just say that I missed the twist the first time around and it blew me away. On re-reads, I can see just how carefully the hints are planted. It's lovely.</p>
<p>But really? The thing that puts this book right up there with the best of them? The final battle scene. A one-man polka band powered Tyrannosaurus rex brought back on a stormy Halloween night for one last hunt through the streets of Chicago. So cool.</p>
<p>One interesting note that I hadn't noticed before, but there's a part around the middle of this book where Dresden talks with Morty. He drops a line about how Murphy's dad was good people... And then corrects that to <i>is</i> good people. Coming from an ectomancer, that's an interesting line. Each re-read is fascinating to see how Butcher weaves his world together, both planting seeds well in advance or re-using minor plot points in major ways. We'll just leave it at that.</p>

<p>Another very solid entry.</p>
<p>Basically, there's black magic afoot. Fear monsters from the Nevernever are attacking a horror movie convention and it's up to Dresden to find out why. Add to that complications with Michael's now almost adult daughter Molly. The interactions between Molly and Dresden are weird and uncomfortable at times, but on the other hand they seem for the most part disturbingly realistic.</p>
<p>I like a lot of the characterization here. We get more on the Carpenters, in particular Molly and Charity. I really love that entire family. Charity shines in this book in particular. We learn a bit more about why she dislikes Dresden so much and how much of a badass she is when the need is right. Molly is in and out of the spotlight quite a bit, but it's obvious she'll be central to future books.</p>
<p>We also get a bit of a hint about how other wizards bend the rules. It's heavily implied that the Gatekeeper has a warning from the future that he passed on to Dresden. It's not time travel strictly speaking... but still.</p>
<p>Then, there's the ending. While there is still a monster-of-the-book thing going on, we're really seeing more of the larger implication of the Dresdenverse. There are a few questions raised here (who is the person behind the person behind the curtain) which we don't even get an answer to... Yet. It's annoying in the first book or two of a series, but this many along, it's something that can really make a series.</p>
<p>Amusing aside: Thus far there are baddies with the same name as my wife and my daughter in this series. It's a bit jarring each time I come across them.</p>
<p>Fun quote of the day: "It is far easier to avoid inappropriate amorous desires if one runs screaming from the room every time a pretty girl comes in."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91475.White_Night"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/9-white-night.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I think this is one of the first of the Dresden Files books that really feels like a more traditional mystery. (Or at least my idea thereof; I don't read much traditional mystery).  Mysterious shadowy figures and murders abound and throughout it's unclear exactly who/what is responsible. There are a few clues for the reader that Dresden otherwise misses, but for the most part, we learn about happenings as they happen.</p>
<p>One really cool scene: Dresden takes advantage of the fact that you can draw energy from the surrounding environment in order to power a spell. He proceed to shoot off a pillar of fire 2-3 feet wide and 20 stories high into the night sky. Can you imagine being a mortal living in Chicago and seeing that? The best part: He didn't even need the fire. He just needed to freeze a chunk of Lake Michigan. Love it.</p>
<p>Another great part about this book in the continued characterization. We learn more about Mouse's magical nature (A real temple dog!). We get another cool scene of Marcone saving the day (he's really starting to make a habit about that). And we get a much better look at House Raith in general and Thomas in specific. For the most 'human' of the vampires, they're still kind of terrifying when they want to be.</p>
<p>So far as larger world building, the stage doesn't change overly much. There are more details about what exactly happened in Dresden's past with He Who Walks Behind.</p>
<p>Oh and that scene at the end with Lash. I really liked her. I liked seeing how Dresden dealt with the power he had and the power he could stand to gain. It was neat to see how just as she changed him, he changed her in turn. It will be interesting to see what fall out there will be from that (if any) in future books.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/927979.Small_Favor"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/10-small-favor.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Small Favor combines my favorite parts of the Dresden Files: the Denarians and Knights of the Cross, Marcone, and the Fae in varying degrees. On top of that, where White Night tended towards mystery, Small Favor is straight up actions. The story hits the ground running and never really stops, right through several big set piece battles and one of the bigger finales we've seen (albeit not quite up to the level of Sue...).</p>
<p>On top of that, we get another of Butcher's lovely twists which just drop the bottom out of a story. You think you know what's going on... turns out you've missed the same huge clue that Dresden has. I'm always impressed with those.</p>
<p>There was one particular interesting thought that stuck with me even after I finished the book. Neither the Knights nor the Denarians believed that it was possible Dresden could be rid of Lash without taking up the coin. Everyone has their blind spots. It makes you think about where your own blind spots might be. And back in the Dresdenverse, given how tightly tied the Dresden Files are to Dresden's point of view, what is <i>he</i> missing?</p>
<p>We're also starting to see more and more power creep. Dresden may have lost the ability to sling Hellfire with Lash's demise, but he's got a new trick up his sleeve curtesy of a new heavy hitter on the supernatural scene. If all of the big guns show up in the promised finale to the Dresden Files another ten books down the line... It's going to be an interesting day.</p>
<p>Fun quotes:</p>
<p>"We're ostriches and the whole world is sand."</p>
<p>"That's the problem with you immortal types. You wouldn't get a pop culture reference if it skittered up your neck and implanted an embryo down your esophagus."</p>

<p>Morgan shows up on Dresden's doorstep and asks for his help. Things degrade pretty much exactly as you might expect from there.</p>
<p>We do get a third part in the trifeta of styles from the previous two books: mystery to action to political thriller. There is still plenty of the first two, but now we're dealing primarily with the fallout of a politically motivated murder.</p>
<p>Two things that we learn quite a bit more about in this book are the home of the White Council in (under) Edinburgh and more about that island in the middle of Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>For the former, it's interesting to get a bit more of an insight into just how powerful the senior council can be--while at the same time showing how they're all still human.</p>
<p>In the case of the latter, we get just about as many new questions as we get answers, with a number of characters surprised at just how crazy Dresden is and with hints coming from all over the place about how that island is more interesting/important than we know even now.</p>
<p>We also finally get the start of answers about the Black Council. We're still nowhere near to finding out who is in the core of that particular conspiracy, but it's starting to come to the fore. I do hope that it doesn't take until the planned series finales in a dozen books for more large parts to come out into the open...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6585201-changes"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/12-changes.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>In the first chapter of Changes, Dresden learns he has a daughter. Throughout the book, he loses everything (his car, his office, his home...). He makes deals he promised he would never make.</p>
<p>He takes on archangel-tier baddies--and wins. He takes on the Red Court and kills them all.</p>
<p>And in the last chapter, he's shot. Presumably fatally. (Although given that this is book 12 out of a planned more than 20...</p>
<p>I remember the first time I read this book. Ghost Story wasn't out yet. That was a long wait. Time time around, I can start immediately (and know what actually happened). That's doesn't make this stories impact and less.</p>
<p>Another thing that has changed since I last read Ghost Story? I have a daughter now. Younger than Maggie, but still. If I were in the same situation; if I had to make the choices Dresden made?</p>
<p>The best Dresden Files thus far, by a decent margin. Where can it even go from here?</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8058301-ghost-story"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/13-ghost-story.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>And then he was dead. Ish..</p>
<p>Of course the ending of Changes couldn't be the end of Dresden. And after Ghost Story, I think I can forgive Butcher for that cliff hanger. Mostly. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>
<p>Thematically, it's a different sort of story, with Dresden mostly without any of his usual tools of the trade and having to learn a whole new set of rules for how the rules work. After the crazy power spike he got throughout Changes, it's something that needed to happen and I think it was done well.</p>
<p>On top of that, we get all of the fall out. Turns out, when you operate on Dresden's scale and when you take out an entire race of bad guys, you create something of a massive void. And now his friends have to deal with it.</p>
<p>Among the developments of Ghost Story is bringing Mortimer Lindquist (it's funny because 'mort' or something similar means death in many Romance languages) to the forefront. Just trying to stay alive makes sense in the darkness that is the Dresdenverse and yet in the end, he still comes through for the good guys. He had a nice character arc, particularly for what was previously a minor, annoying character.</p>
<p>We also get a previous bad guy back again. No spoilers, but given the subject matter (dead things), it's guessable. It was nice to see the fallout of previous problems like that come up again. I have a feeling we'll be feeling that throughout the rest of the series.</p>
<p>All together, it wasn't my favorite book in the series--it's just too different. On the other hand, it's a good way to hit the reset button on a fair bit of power creep and shift the Dresden Files to a new normal. It'll be interesting to see where it goes next...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12216302-cold-days"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/14-cold-days.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Dresden is remarkably good at weaseling his way out of deals he should never have gotten himself into in the first place. This time around though? His number is up. He has to work for Mab.</p>
<p>Mab first job for her new Knight? Kill Maeve.</p>
<p>All righty then.</p>
<p>Crazy scene: Mab throws Dresden a birthday party. In a huge scale model of his old apartment, made of ice. One thing you can say for the Fae, when they go all in, they really go all in.</p>
<p>Crazy scene: Dresden floats a boat off the bottom of Lake Chicago by freezing a large chunk of ice. He comes out of it coated with frost. He's got some serious new oomph going on and it's kind of terrifying.</p>
<p>Crazy scene: Dresden learns about the 'gate' part of the Gatekeeper's job. He learns more about the outsiders than he ever wanted to know. He learns more about Winter's role in all this (and thus his own). He learns exactly what it means to have claimed Demonreach. He starts to learn about how it's all related. He starts to learn who the real enemy is... The Dresdenverse is getting bigger.</p>
<p>And then the ending. Well that was intense. We have new Summer and Winter Ladies. The latter of which is Molly...</p>
<p>The next few books are going to be even more interesting.</p>
<p>(I feel like I say that a lot with Dresden...)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19486421-skin-game"><img src="//blog.jverkamp.com/2016/04/22/dresden-files/15-skin-game.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>And then there was a heist.</p>
<p>Book 15, so the Denarians are due. In they came, and not in a way that anyone would have expected. Turns out, Mab owes Nicodemus a favor. She wants Dresden to carry it out.</p>
<p>What's the job? Oh, not that complicated. Steal the Holy Grail from Hades. Yes, that Hades.</p>
<p>Dresden is voluntold that he'll be working with Binder--who Dresden threatened to kill the next time he saw him; Hanna Ascher--a warlock with a serious gift for fire magic; Anna Valmont--who's team was previously killed by the people she's now working for; and Goodman Gray--a seriously creepy shapeshifter with a fascinating background and work ethic.</p>
<p>It's kind of awesome to get the handful of new characters along with fleshing out some old favorites. Combined with the twist in genre and we have a story that manages to at once grow the Dresdenverse yet more while at the same time pulling back the scope as a bit of a breather. Based on the ending, it's going to get interesting again.</p>
<p>On another cool side, we learn a bit more about Uriel and his archangelic powers and get a small chance to see Michael back in the action. Michael remains among my favorite characters in the books, so it's good that he yet has a part to play. Oh, and he has the power to destroy a galaxy. Just so you know that.</p>
<p>Random note: There's a kind of crazy explicit sex scene roughly half way through the book. It's a bit of a surprise, especially when you're listening to the book on a car ride with someone who's never listened to any of the other Dresden books before. So it goes.</p>
<p>Awesome scene: Butters goes full Jedi Knight. And then there was a Jewish Knight of the Cross. It's actually getting kind of ridiculous how only 1 of the 4 we've seen (2 of 5 if you count Murphy) has been particularly devout.</p>
<hr />
<p>So... that's a thing. I cannot wait for Peace Talks... But I guess I'll have to. Hey, if it takes long enough to come out, I might just read the entire series yet again before then. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" src="/emoji/smile.svg" /></p>
<p>Up next on my audiobook lineup I'll be re-listening to the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40910-mistborn">Mistborn series</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson">Brandon Sanderson</a> in preparation for the two new ones that have just come out. I previously listened to The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10803121-the-alloy-of-law">Alloy of Law</a> (see my <a href="//blog.jverkamp.com/2015/12/31/2015-reading-list-retrospective">2015 Reading List Retrospective</a>), so I already know that they translate well to audio. I'm looking forward to it.</p>
