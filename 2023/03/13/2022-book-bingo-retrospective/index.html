Let&rsquo;s see how I did!</p><h1>2022 Book Bingo</h1><button class=bingo-toggle>Toggle Display Mode</button><table class=bingo><tr><td><div class=tooltip>A Book from r/Fantasy&rsquo;s Top LGBTQIA List<div class=tooltiptext><p>Any book on <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ifmx04/rfantasys_2020_top_lgbtqa_books_voting_results/ target=_blank rel=noopener>this list</a>, including sequels.</p><p>Hard Mode: A book or series that received ten votes or less.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Weird Ecology<div class=tooltiptext><p>Story takes place in a world that is wildly different from our own and includes such things as unique environments, strange flora and fauna, unusual ecosystems, etc. The difference in environment, flora and fauna, and ecosystems cannot simply be &ldquo;it’s a fantasy world,&rdquo; but something that is fundamentally different about the world itself. Example: The Bone Ships by RJ Barker counts as this is a poisonous world without trees and the world had to evolve in significantly different ways to deal with that. Meanwhile The Liveship Traders by Robin Hobb would not count, as it is fairly close to our own world’s ecology just with the added presence of dragons.</p><p>Hard Mode: Not written by Jeff VanderMeer or China Miéville.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Two or More Authors<div class=tooltiptext><p>Any book written by two or more authors such as This is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone. Anthologies count!</p><p>Hard Mode: Three or more authors.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Historical SFF<div class=tooltiptext><p>Any book within the historical fantasy subgenre.</p><p>Hard Mode: Not based in Britain or Ireland.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Set in Space<div class=tooltiptext><p>A book that takes place primarily (at least 50%) off planet. IE: on a spaceship, space station, asteroid, space whale, free floating in space, etc.</p><p>Hard Mode: Characters are not originally from Earth. It is acceptable for the characters to be descendants of Earthlings as long as they are not themselves from Earth.</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class=tooltip>Standalone<div class=tooltiptext><p>A book that is not part of a series or a larger world. No connected novellas or short stories.</p><p>Hard Mode: Not on r/Fantasy’s <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/e9ukxr/the_2019_rfantasy_favourite_standalones_poll/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Favorite Standalones List</a>.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Anti-Hero<div class=tooltiptext><p>Wikipedia describes an antihero as “a character in a story who lacks conventional heroic qualities and attributes, such as idealism, courage, and morality. Although antiheroes may sometimes perform actions that are morally correct, it is not always for the right reasons, often acting primarily out of self-interest or in ways that defy conventional ethical codes.” Examples: Locke Lamora in the Gentleman Bastard series or most grimdark books.</p><p>Hard Mode: A YA book with an anti-hero.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Book Club OR Readalong Book<div class=tooltiptext><p>Any past or active r/Fantasy book clubs count as well as past or active r/Fantasy readalongs. See our full list of book clubs <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/wiki/index/bookclubs target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>.</p><p>Hard Mode: Must read a current selection of either a book club or readalong and participate in the discussion.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Cool Weapon<div class=tooltiptext><p>At least one main character uses a weapon with magical properties.</p><p>Hard Mode: Weapon has a unique name. Examples: Excalibur from Arthurian legend, Dragnipur in Malazan, Sting in Lord of the Rings, etc.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Revolutions and Rebellions<div class=tooltiptext><p>A book featuring a revolution. Any overthrowing of governments, monarchs, and systems will do.</p><p>Hard Mode: Revolution/Rebellion is the main focus of the plot.</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class=tooltip>Name in the Title<div class=tooltiptext><p>A character’s first or last name appears in the title. Example: Gideon the Ninth.</p><p>Hard Mode: The title has the character’s first and last name. Example: The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Author Uses Initials<div class=tooltiptext><p>Read a book by an author who goes by their initials like N. K. Jemisin or uses initials somewhere in their name like George R. R. Martin.</p><p>Hard Mode: Initials are a pseudonym and not from the author’s actual name. Examples: T. Kingfisher or K. J. Parker. ADDENDUM: Please do not go snooping to see if a name fits. If it isn&rsquo;t clear based on an author&rsquo;s webpage or social media, assume that it is their real name.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Published in 2022<div class=tooltiptext><p>A book published for the first time in 2022 (no reprints or new editions).</p><p>Hard Mode: It&rsquo;s also a debut novel&ndash;as in it&rsquo;s the author&rsquo;s first published novel.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Urban Fantasy<div class=tooltiptext><p>A subgenre of fantasy in which the narrative uses supernatural elements in a 19th-century to 21st-century urban society. Often overlaps with other subgenres like paranormal romance and superhero stories.</p><p>Hard Mode: Book has an LGBTQ+ POV character.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Set in Africa<div class=tooltiptext><p>Book must either be set in Africa like Rosewater by Tade Thompson or in an analogous setting that is based on a real-world African setting like Raybearer by Jordan Ifueko.</p><p>Hard Mode: Author is of African heritage.</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class=tooltip>Non-Human Protagonist<div class=tooltiptext><p>Main character must not be human or partially human. Humanoid aliens or anthropomorphic animals do count.</p><p>Hard Mode: Non-humanoid protagonist. No elves, angels, dwarves, hobbits, or humanoid aliens.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey<div class=tooltiptext><p>Any book that deals with time not behaving as it should. Time travel, time slips, time loops, time stopping, multiple timelines, etc., all work for this square.</p><p>Hard Mode: No time travel. Book involves something off about time that’s not necessarily time travel. Example: In The Chronicles of Narnia, time moves at a different speed in Narnia than in the real world.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Five SFF Short Stories<div class=tooltiptext><p>Any short story as long as there are five of them.</p><p>Hard Mode: Read an entire SFF anthology or collection.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Features Mental Health<div class=tooltiptext><p>Story takes a strong interest in or explores themes like mental wellness and illness, self-care, and so on. Learn more about the basics of mental health <a href=https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/learn/index.htm target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>. Here is <a href=https://www.tor.com/2020/09/22/8-sff-books-that-center-mental-health/ target=_blank rel=noopener>a list</a> of SFF books that center mental health to get you started.</p><p>Hard Mode: Not The Stormlight Archive or any books in the linked list.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Self-Published OR Indie Publisher<div class=tooltiptext><p>Self-published or published through a small, indie publisher. If the novel has been picked up by a publisher as long as you read it when it was self-pubbed it will still count.</p><p>Hard Mode: Self-published and has fewer than 100 ratings on Goodreads, OR an indie publisher that has done an AMA with r/Fantasy.</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class=tooltip>Award Finalist, But Not Won<div class=tooltiptext><p>Any book that was short-listed for an award (or multiple awards) but never received an award. You can check out <a href=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/award_directory.cgi target=_blank rel=noopener>this list</a> of SFF awards at ISFDB for inspiration.</p><p>Hard Mode: Neither Hugo-nominated nor Nebula-nominated (check <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K649Hvjwi4P6Ne9wNjJYFglWj0_KGp91ik2wYSH33Kk/edit?usp=sharing" target=_blank rel=noopener>this list</a> for ineligible novels and novellas).</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>BIPOC Author<div class=tooltiptext><p>Author must be Black, Indigenous or a Person of Color.</p><p>Hard Mode: A book written by an Indigenous author. Check out <a href=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/margaretkingsbury/native-american-heritage-month-book-recommendations target=_blank rel=noopener>this list</a> of Indigenous SFF books to get you started.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Shapeshifters<div class=tooltiptext><p>At least one character has the ability to change their physical form.</p><p>Hard Mode: Most prominent shifter is not a wolf/dog shifter. For instance, werewolves can exist but can’t be the most notable shifter characters/main characters.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>No Ifs, Ands, or Buts<div class=tooltiptext><p>Title does not include the following words: the, a/an, and, or, if, of, but.</p><p>Hard Mode: Title is three words or more.</p></div></div></td><td><div class=tooltip>Family Matters<div class=tooltiptext><p>A book that features biological family ties. Sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers, grandparents, and children – as long as the relationship plays a part, it’s welcome for this square.</p><p>Hard Mode: Features at least three generations in a single family.</p></div></div></td></tr></table><br><p>So far as I believe, I actually hit hardmode for all of the squares this time, although I did replace one of the squares again this year (for row 2, column 3 instead of book club, I pulled in found family again and did hard mode).</p><p>Stats wise, I had 3 graphic novels again. But once again, I&rsquo;m counting the entire run as a book, so I think timewise it&rsquo;s aligned with if not more than a single book.</p><h2 id=mini-reviews-for-each-book>Mini-reviews for each book</h2><p>Or click through / click any of the covers above for full reviews.</p><p>My favorites are marked with [!].</p><p>Yes, I have a lot of favorites. It was a good year.</p><p>Graphic novels are marked with [g]. In each case, I read the entire series of ~10+, which all together is well more than a single novel (IMO). It&rsquo;s a great format for storytelling.</p><p>[!] <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/12/06/foundryside/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Foundryside</a> by Robert Jackson Bennett</p><ul><li><p>A book on <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ifmx04/rfantasys_2020_top_lgbtqa_books_voting_results/ target=_blank rel=noopener>r/Fantasy’s Top LGBTQIA List</a> (Hard: A book/series with ten votes or less)</p></li><li><p>Excellent world/magic building; I love stories where magic is basically re-programming reality. On top of that, I love the characters. A &lsquo;damn good thief&rsquo; with some magical tricks, a cop obsessed with justice to a fault, the grumpy mentor, and his even more brilliant assistant. It&rsquo;s all there.</p></li></ul><p><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/03/the-bone-ships/ target=_blank rel=noopener>The Bone Ships</a> by R.J. Barker</p><ul><li><p>Weird Ecology (Hard: Not written by Jeff VanderMeer or China Miéville)</p></li><li><p>A primarily nautical setting with ships that are built out of the bones of giant sea monsters. If you like sea-themed stories, you&rsquo;ll love this, there&rsquo;s a ton of it.</p></li></ul><p><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/02/22/the-vela/ target=_blank rel=noopener>The Vela</a> by Yoon Ha Lee, Becky Chambers, Rivers Solomon, S.L. Huang</p><ul><li><p>Two or More Authors (Hard: Three or More)</p></li><li><p>One of the modern serial stories written for <a href=https://Realm.fm target=_blank rel=noopener>Realm.fm</a> (originally Serial Box), it&rsquo;s from 4 authors that I&rsquo;ve either previously loved or are high on my to read list. It&rsquo;s set against a solar system where mining the sun is freezing out the outer worlds. Climate refuges, writ large. On top of that, you have the contrast between the main characters (a mercenary/sniper from one of the outer worlds and the child of the current president with hacking skills) is a shining jewel of the series. It&rsquo;s fascinating to see how the different authors handle it.</p></li></ul><p><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/23/a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/ target=_blank rel=noopener>A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians</a> by H.G. Parry</p><ul><li><p>Historical SFF (Hard: Not based in Britain or Ireland)</p><ul><li>Stretching the &rsquo;not in Britain&rsquo; a bit, in that a good chunk of the book does take place in Britain, but I would argue that especially in this book a large part of the plot is focused on the French Revolution with another plotline in the Americas.</li></ul></li><li><p>Historical fantasy. Take the French revolution, add class based magic (fire, water, weather, mind control) and vampires (really &lsquo;blood magic&rsquo;) and see what happens. It has the same problems most historical fantasy has, if you take a topic like slavery or broad classism and justify it as &lsquo;because magic/vampires&rsquo; it somewhat removes the blames from those who really caused the issues. Still an interesting book.</p></li></ul><p>[!] <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/consider-phlebas/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Consider Phlebas</a> by Iain M.

Take &ldquo;a utopian, post-scarcity space society of humanoid aliens, and advanced superintelligent artificial intelligences living in artificial habitats spread across the Milky Way galaxy&rdquo; and then realize that even in a &lsquo;utopia&rsquo; people are still people (even non-Human people) and you end with an action-filled romp across a bunch of exotic settings, mixing far future technology and timeless problems.</p></li></ul><p><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/10/05/the-starless-sea/ target=_blank rel=noopener>The Starless Sea</a> by Erin Morgenstern</p><ul><li><p>Standalone (Hard: not on <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/e9ukxr/the_2019_rfantasy_favourite_standalones_poll/ target=_blank rel=noopener>r/Fantasy’s Favorite Standalones List</a>)</p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s got absolutely beautiful prose and visuals.

It&rsquo;s cute and a quick, fun read.</p></li></ul><p>[!] <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/17/the-rage-of-dragons/ target=_blank rel=noopener>The Rage of Dragons</a> by Evan Winter</p><ul><li><p>Set in Africa (Hard: Author is of African heritage)</p></li><li><p>African-inspired Bronze-age fantasy with caste-based tension, crazy swords, demons, dragons, and the feeling that the good guys might not be so good after all. You have the super talented main character, doing things otherwise thought impossible. He&rsquo;s a bit hard to read at times, but still fun.</p></li></ul><p>[!] <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/22/the-galaxy-and-the-ground-within/ target=_blank rel=noopener>The Galaxy, and the Ground Within</a> by Becky Chambers</p><ul><li><p>Non-Human Protagonist (Hard: Non-humanoid)</p></li><li><p>The 4th &lsquo;cozy / slice of life sci-fi&rsquo; of the Wayfarers series (I read the first just at the end of last year&rsquo;s bingo). Each one has almost a completely different cast, albeit with some overlap. This is no different following a bunch of aliens stranded at the sci-fi equivalent of a truck stop as the sky rains down on them. It&rsquo;s all about how people are people, no matter how literally alien they are.</p></li></ul><p>[!] <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/14/the-first-fifteen-lives-of-harry-august/ target=_blank rel=noopener>The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August</a> by Claire North</p><ul><li><p>Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey; time doesn’t behave as it should (Hard: No time travel)</p></li><li><p>Take the timeloop premise of Groundhog Day (et al), apply it to lifetimes, add a few neat worldbuilding twists, break things up with a cataclysm coming back through time… and you have The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August. I love all of those things, so of course I love this book as well. :D One of the best parts is the idea that in a world with a number of these &lsquo;immortals&rsquo; time can be flexible. Pass a message to an immortal about to die&mldr; and they&rsquo;ll remember it decades earlier when next their born.</p></li></ul><p><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/02/skin-and-other-stories/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Skin and Other Stories</a> by Roald Dahl</p><ul><li><p>Five SFF Short Stories (Hard: Entire collection)</p><ul><li>They&rsquo;re probably arguably more horror / thriller, but there are certainly some fantastical elements.</li></ul></li><li><p>So&mldr; the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach wrote some more adult horror. Which in hindsight makes sense. Those books have some seriously creepy bits if you think about them enough.</p></li></ul><p>[!] <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/06/21/the-outside/ target=_blank rel=noopener>The Outside</a> by Ada Hoffman</p><ul><li><p>Features Mental Health (Hard: Not the Stormlight Archive or on <a href=https://www.tor.com/2020/09/22/8-sff-books-that-center-mental-health/ target=_blank rel=noopener>this list</a>)</p></li><li><p>Well that’s certainly an interesting book. It’s one part autism as ‘different, but that’s okay and sometimes it’s a superpower and sometimes it sucks’, one part cosmic horror, and one part fascinating worldbuilding with technoreligion writ large. I enjoyed it, even if it felt rough at times.</p></li></ul><p>[!] <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/11/letters-from-a-shipwreck-in-the-sea-of-suns-and-moons/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Letters from a Shipwreck in the Sea of Suns and Moons</a> by Raymond St. Elmo</p><ul><li><p>Self-Published OR Indie Publisher (Hard: Fewer than 100 ratings or with an AMA)</p></li><li><p>That… is a truly delightfully weird book. It jumps around in structure and time between letters from a sailor to the girl he left back home–to said sailor being interviewed by … someone–to stories about a most mysterious shipwreck and the island he came to inhabit thereafter. Structurally, it’s very strange and at times hard to figure out what in the world is going on–but that’s all intentional. It’s really quite worth it in the end.</p></li></ul><p><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/17/last-argument-of-kings/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Last Argument of Kings</a> by Joe Abercrombie</p><ul><li><p>Award Finalist, But Not Won (Hard: Neither Hugo- nor Nebula-nominated)</p></li><li><p>Another &lsquo;how haven&rsquo;t you read him&rsquo; author: Joe Abercrombie. It&rsquo;s dark, gritty fantasy. throughout the series, it&rsquo;s fascinating he can do with characters. Glokta is a terrible person–and he makes us root for him. Logen is a berserker in the truest sense–and he makes us feel sorry for him. Jezal is excellent at failing upward–and he makes us feel sorry for him. It’s all around amazing and the real strength of the series.</p></li></ul><p><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/06/a-snake-falls-to-earth/ target=_blank rel=noopener>A Snake Falls to Earth</a> by Darcie Little Badger</p><ul><li><p>BIPOC Author (Hard: Indigenous author)</p></li><li><p>I do love stories that take mythology I don’t know as well and expands on it. In this case, the Lipan (Apache) people of what became the southwestern US down into Mexico. The idea of a world inhabited by animal people–those that can shape shift between an animal and a human form–that was once connected to Earth… and now is not. I don’t think I’ve ever otherwise seen a cottonmouth shifter, especially not the equivalent of a teenage one. It’s a lot of fun. And seeing how her and Nina (our human/our world protagonist) eventually interact is just great.</p></li></ul><p><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/07/28/out-of-the-blue/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Out of the Blue</a> by Jason June</p><ul><li><p>Shapeshifters (Hard: Most prominent shifter is not a were/dog shifter)</p></li><li><p>Take part gay teenage lifeguard lover of rom-coms, just broken up with the Love Of His Life(tm), add a non-binary (because they all are) mermaid, sent on a month long <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumspringa target=_blank rel=noopener>Rumspringa</a> to the surface, make it into a love story (of course) with all the (teenage) relationship twists and turns that entails &mldr; and you have Out of the Blue. It&rsquo;s not my usual sort of book, but I did enjoy it.</p></li></ul><p>[!] <a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/04/08/all-systems-red/ target=_blank rel=noopener>All Systems Red</a> by Martha Wells</p><ul><li><p>No Ifs, Ands, or Buts; Title doesn’t contain the, a/an, and, or, if, of, but (Hard: Title is three words or more)</p></li><li><p>Okay, I get what all the hype is about. Take a heavily armed cyborg/clone, designed entirely as muscle to defend the more squishy ’traditional’ humans, have it turn off the software constraining it from killing everyone, add in a wonderfully snarky sense of humor… and see what happens. Murderbot is a wonderful protagonist.</p></li></ul><p><a href=https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/03/08/shaman/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Shaman</a> by Kim Stanley Robinson</p><ul><li><p>Family Matters (Hard: At least three generations)</p></li><li><p>Take a survival story (a la Gary Paulsen’s Hatchet), re-tune it for a world where survival is life rather than a temporary situation (ten thousand or so years ago), sprinkle in an oddly modern feeling narrator, and make it super horny… voila.
