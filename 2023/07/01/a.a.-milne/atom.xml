Not sure how much else there is to say.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I so remember the old Winnie the Pooh &amp;amp; Christmas Too (from 1991). Man the nostalgia when the bugs (and their Napoleabug leader) sound the charge. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know when I would have watched it, but I remember that part!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s cute. The kids enjoyed it. It&amp;rsquo;s probably not something I&amp;rsquo;d ever choose to watch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/13/the-many-adventures-of-winnie-the-pooh/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/11/13/the-many-adventures-of-winnie-the-pooh/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is just delightful&amp;ndash;and a blast of nostalgia on top of that. I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to actually watch all of the Disney classic growing up (still haven&amp;rsquo;t), but I definiately watched this one. And now, after reading many of the stories to my children, it&amp;rsquo;s a delight to be able to share the video form with them as well!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really like the style of these stories. It&amp;rsquo;s a mix of animated world with the real storybook characters (Pooh et al), but also obviously in a book, as they hob from page to page. It&amp;rsquo;s not the story of style you&amp;rsquo;d always expect to work, but it really works here.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
