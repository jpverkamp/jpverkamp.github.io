&lt;p>Rocket: Someday I&amp;rsquo;m gonna make great machines that fly. And me and my friends are gonna go flying together, into the forever and beautiful sky.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well that was fun. If you liked the previous two Guardians of the Galaxy entries (or especially the Holiday Special), I expect you&amp;rsquo;ll love this. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t care for them, there&amp;rsquo;s a chance!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/07/23/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh that was delightful. How did I not watch this sooner?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell: it&amp;rsquo;s a standard &amp;ldquo;save Christmas&amp;rdquo; plotline gone so &lt;em>very &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> alien. With Mantis and Drax having the main plotline to bring Peter Quill that one perfect gift is so fun. They&amp;rsquo;re just alien enough to bring more than a touch of chaos with them to Earth while at the same time human enough to relate to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, don&amp;rsquo;t expect anything deeper than the above. There really isn&amp;rsquo;t anything here you&amp;rsquo;d miss by not watching&amp;ndash;but on the other other hand it&amp;rsquo;s a quick watch and fun enough to be worth it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Suicide Squad</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/24/the-suicide-squad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/24/the-suicide-squad/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh, that is a glorious movie. Exactly what an R rated half-satirical superhero movie should be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually seen the first Suicide Squad or Birds of Prey (yet), so it&amp;rsquo;s not quite as strange that they apparently kept some of the characters/actors while ignoring some events and keeping others. Other than that&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s just so enjoyable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Starting right from the opening:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="cover-image">&lt;img src="https://blog.jverkamp.com/embeds/2021/suicide-squad-1.jpg">
&lt;/figure>

&lt;p>You have the Suicide Squad. Super powered criminals, given the chance to take a few years off their sentence if they&amp;rsquo;ll use their powers to do the jobs that the &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; heroes are either too busy or too &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo; to do. It&amp;rsquo;s a crazy yet awesome plot and the cast is amazing. Nathan Fillion as T.D.K&amp;ndash;his arms come off. Jai Courtney back as Boomerang&amp;ndash;he throws&amp;hellip; a boomerang. Flula Borg as Javelin&amp;ndash;likewise, with a javelin. Mayling Ng as Mongal&amp;ndash;she&amp;rsquo;s an alien or something? Pete Davidson as Blackguard&amp;ndash;who knows. And especially Sean Gunn as Weasel&amp;ndash;a humanoid&amp;hellip; weasel. And Michael Rooker as Savant&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure, expert at throwing things? Him and Sean Gunn together was amusing coming off Guardians of the Galaxy. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit I looked that one up; he&amp;rsquo;s in everything! It&amp;rsquo;s not at all the team of heroes you&amp;rsquo;d expect.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/13/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/08/13/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol.-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>After the surprisingly awesome &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/13/guardians-of-the-galaxy/">Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/a>, it was really a question of: could they do it again? The answer, a resounding&amp;hellip; sort of?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has some pretty awesome moments. The opening battle in particular is spectacular (I love the contrast of dancing Baby Groot against a big smack down in the background). And we get all piles of additional humor based around Drax&amp;rsquo;s literalness, Rocket being a racoon, &amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guardians of the Galaxy</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/13/guardians-of-the-galaxy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2021/07/13/guardians-of-the-galaxy/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had forgotten just how &lt;em>fun&lt;/em> Guardians of the Galaxy is. Back when I &lt;a href="#original-2014-review">first reviewed it in 2014&lt;/a>, it surprised me with how different it was and just how much it opened up the Marvel Universe. Well, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen some pretty crazy things since then (Thor Ragnarok springs to mind), but it&amp;rsquo;s still a pretty crazy movie. I mean, come on. It&amp;rsquo;s a man obsessed with classic rock, a badass green woman assassin, an overly literal shirtless wrestler, a cybernetically enhanced racoon, and a speaking tree &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> &lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Add in the first real hints of the Infinity Stones, Thanos as the continuing &amp;lsquo;bigger bad&amp;rsquo;, and you have a pretty impactful movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then on top of that, you get an absolutely hilarious movie, some wonderful action scenes (the meet up / fight in the square at the beginning is particularly wonderful, but there are several), and a whole range of colorful new characters. When you don&amp;rsquo;t have to even try to stick to what works on Earth&amp;hellip; things get pretty silly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, a wonderful movie. I think this time around, I actually rate it higher than the Avengers, although still below Iron Man and Captain America 1 and 2. Well worth a watch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the record: the ending scene is still kind of dumb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Random side note: the idea of a whole fleet of starships linking up (somehow) and literally trying to push a very slow moving enemy spaceship back into space is just bonkers. Among a movie full of crazy scenes, that one came the closest to really pulling me out of the film. But so it goes.&lt;/p>
