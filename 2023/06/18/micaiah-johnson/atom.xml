If you visit a world where another you is still alive, you die.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why have I survived? Because I am a creature more devious than all the other mes put together. Because I saw myself bleeding out and instead of checking for a pulse, I began collecting her things. I survive the desert like a coyote survives, like all tricksters do.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating premise, especially when you dig just a bit deeper: Who are the people most likely able to jump? Who&amp;rsquo;s the most likely to have died on other worlds?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a story about privilege. About a world built for the rich and powerful&amp;ndash;by those who have nothing or less; those that pay everything and get nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Cara is stuck right in the middle of it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
