After &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> set the stage and &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/19/siege-and-storm/">Siege and Storm&lt;/a> raised the stakes, Ruin and Rising really brings everything home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have the increasing religious fever of Alina as Saint&amp;ndash;whether or not that&amp;rsquo;s what she wants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have what&amp;rsquo;s left of Alina&amp;rsquo;s friends and allies trying desperately to hold off the ever more powerful&amp;ndash;and ever more unhinged&amp;ndash;Darkling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We finally get some real history, digging deeper into where the Darkling came from&amp;hellip; and perhaps how Alina fits into it all as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have more adventures; a desperate bid to find the third Amplifier that may well save the day&amp;ndash;or doom them all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally&amp;ndash;obvious seeing as it&amp;rsquo;s the final novel in the trilogy&amp;ndash;we have victory. But at what cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s by a decent margin my favorite of the three. A solid conclusion, in my opinion. Now I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the other series in the same world. Six of Crows especially to see where those threads in &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/25/shadow-and-bone-season-1/">the show&lt;/a> came from and King of Scars for a &amp;lsquo;what comes next&amp;rsquo;. Onward!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Siege and Storm</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/19/siege-and-storm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/19/siege-and-storm/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When people say impossible, they usually mean improbable.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a> had quite the ending. The Darkling showing his true allegiance, death and destruction, Alina and Mal on the run&amp;hellip; So of course in Siege and Storm they get captured by pirates (&lt;em>cough&lt;/em> I mean &lt;em>privateers&lt;/em>), the Darkling shows up again, they go meet the royal family, the Darkling shows up again, and in the end&amp;hellip; things just keep ending up getting worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s really a solid step up from Shadow and Bone. It&amp;rsquo;s still got a YA core, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely edging on the darker end of it all&amp;ndash;which I really enjoy. I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely looking forward to where this goes next!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shadow and Bone</title><link>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jverkamp.com/2023/09/12/shadow-and-bone/</guid><description>&lt;p>Browsing through Netflix last fall, I came upon &lt;a href="https://blog.jverkamp.com/2022/09/25/shadow-and-bone-season-1/">Shadow and Bone&lt;/a>. Watched it. Quite enjoyed it. Figured I should read the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s not bad, but I enjoyed the show more. For one, it pulls in Kaz and co, which don&amp;rsquo;t appear in this novel at all (they&amp;rsquo;re originally from the related Six of Crows books), which is a bummer. For two, the additional dynamic of Alina as half-Shu in addition to being an orphan added rather a lot to her character.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
