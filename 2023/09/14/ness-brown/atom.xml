To get us out of it, we sent a generation ship to the stars. But when we got there&amp;hellip; it wasn&amp;rsquo;t any better, so they turned around to go home. On the way back&amp;hellip; well, we just might not be alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A generation ship is a great setting for a sci-fi/horror mashup. There really is nowhere to run but plenty of places to hide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea of things lurking out there between the stars? Terrifying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The feel of the book, especially as it ratchets up to the big reveal/fight scenes throughout the ship? Excellent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the only real problems I had with the book were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It was too short! Novella length, but the premise alone could certainly fill a novel.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The technology was a bit odd at times (what exactly are they doing with &amp;lsquo;jumps&amp;rsquo;?)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;span class="spoiler">The things in the dark between stars not actually being the monster? Awesome. But... what were they then?&lt;/span>

&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Worth a read though! A debut author worth following.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
