<p>Basically, I want to back up all of my own personal GitHub repositories along with any from organizations that I am involved with. Strictly speaking, this is a little strange, since it&rsquo;s unlikely that GitHub is going anywhere soon and, if it does, we are likely to have fair warning. But still, it&rsquo;s nice to have a local copy just in case GitHub is down.</p>

<p>The market is not a place in which I usually find myself.</p>

<p>It is noisy and rife with chaos, the throngs pressing into one another all along the way.</p>

<p>Yet today I find myself in unusual circumstances, descending into those very same masses.</p>

<p>Quick and to the point, Isolation tells the story of Heron (who we met briefly in Partials) during the Isolation War. It gives a better picture into the Partials: how they are made, how they are trained, and why they might not only want to, but even been the right to, kill us.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good story and I hope to see more of Heron in the second and third books of the Partials Sequence. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how she&rsquo;s grown and changed in the intervening years and how she interacts with the other human (and not) protagonists.</p>

<p>The man that gave me the box wasn&rsquo;t a very good man. He was tall and skinny and he smelled. But he gave me a shiny silver penny and said that if I took this box to the other end of the market and came back, he could would give me another.</p>

<p>Two shiny silver pennies?</p>

<p>All for taking a stupid little box across the street.</p>

<p>The market is busy. Busy means pockets and pockets mean pennies and pennies mean dinner.</p>

<p>I have yet to find a Sanderson novel that I don&rsquo;t particularly like and Elantris is no exception.</p>

<p>Basically, Elantris focuses around the titular city; once a place of wonder and magic which. Ten years ago, all that ended and now it&rsquo;s populated by essentially zombies: those without heartbeats who cannot die and cannot heal. We follow a few different story lines&ndash;a princess from another land engaged to the prince who gets Elantrisified in the very beginning of the story; an attempted religious coup from multiple fronts; and the politics of a kingdom/city trying to heal after massive upheaval.</p>

<p>The story of Partials takes place 11 years after humanity lost a terrible war. Basically, we created super soldiers (Partials) to fight for us. Of course, after they won the war they turned on us&hellip; Worse yet, right at the same time, there was a virus which killed 99.96% of humanity&ndash;including any new pregnancies.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s where we start. Humanity is stuck on Long Island while the Partials are <em>out there</em> ™. Because no babies can survive the virus, the youngest living people are 14. The main characters are roughly 16. Even stranger, in an effort to figure out how to cure the virus, the Hope Act has been enacted. All women 18 or older must get pregnant as often as possible.</p>

<p>There are certain advantages that come with being dead. When walking down the street, people tend to give you a wide berth.</p>

<p>People don&rsquo;t want to be reminded of their own mortality.</p>

<p>People don&rsquo;t want to be reminded that death is no longer the end.</p>

<p>My target was on the other end of the marketplace, on the front steps of the temple to Acbris, God of the Sun. Ironic, all things considered.</p>
